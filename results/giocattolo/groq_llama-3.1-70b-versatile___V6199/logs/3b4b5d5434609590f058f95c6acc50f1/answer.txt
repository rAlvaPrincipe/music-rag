The bassist of Radiohead is Colin Greenwood. He is the brother of Jonny Greenwood and has been a part of the band since its formation in 1985. However, it's worth noting that there is also a mention of Oli Heffernan playing bass for the band as of 2012, but Colin Greenwood is the primary and well-known bassist of Radiohead.

The Sex Pistols are from London, specifically the Bromley area in south-east London. This is evident from the mention of the "Bromley Contingent", a label given to their fans who came from the Bromley area. The context does not provide information on the exact hometown of the individual band members, but it is clear that the band is associated with the London area.

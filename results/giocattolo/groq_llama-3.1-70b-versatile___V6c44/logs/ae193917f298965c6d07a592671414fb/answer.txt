The band known for its rivalry with Blur is Oasis. This rivalry was famously referred to as the "Battle of Britpop" when both bands released singles on the same day, August 14, 1995. The media often pitted the two bands against each other, with Oasis being perceived as "working class heroes" and Blur as an "inauthentic middle class pop band".

    "text": "The Icicle Works (also known as Icicle Works in the United States) are an English alternative rock band, named after the 1960 short story \"The Day the Icicle Works Closed\" by science fiction author Frederik Pohl. They had a top 20 UK hit with \"Love Is a Wonderful Colour\" (1983).  In the US and Canada, they had one top 40 hit, the 1984 single \"Birds Fly (Whisper to a Scream)\".\nConsisting of singer/guitarist/keyboardist/songwriter Ian McNabb, drummer Chris Sharrock, and bassist Chris Layhe, the band released four albums from 1984 to 1988. The original band broke up in 1989, but McNabb has continued to perform under the Icicle Works name with various replacement members; this revised Icicle Works line-up still plays sporadic live dates. As of 2024, the line up consists of Ian McNabb and Chris Layhe\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1980–1983: Formation and early years ===\nThe band was founded in Liverpool in 1980 when bassist Chris Layhe (who had been in a couple of local rock bands including Elanor and Blind Owl) answered an advertisement for a musical collaborator placed by 20-year-old Ian McNabb. The two got together and started writing. They added drummer Chris Sharrock (who had previously drummed for the Cherry Boys), and began playing live shows as \"The Icicle Works\".\nIn 1981, the band recorded a six-song independently released cassette entitled Ascending. In 1982, they released the independent single \"Nirvana\", which made it to No. 15 on the UK Indie Chart. The following year, the Icicle Works were signed to the Beggars Banquet label, who issued the single \"Birds Fly (Whisper to a Scream)\" on their subsidiary label Situation Two.\nLater that year, The Icicle Works released their biggest UK hit, 1983's \"Love Is a Wonderful Colour\", which was a Top 15 single. Their 1984 eponymous debut album followed shortly thereafter, reached number 24 on the UK Albums Chart and entered the US top 40. Appearing on the US top 40 singles chart at around the same time (and hitting the Canadian top twenty) was \"Whisper to a Scream (Birds Fly)\", a retitled and slightly remixed version of the band's Situation Two release of 1983.\n\n\n=== 1984–1988: Touring years ===\nAfter the release of their self-titled debut album the Icicle Works struggled to match their initial commercial success. They continued to receive critical acclaim as a live band and secured a loyal fan base both in the UK and abroad.\nIn September 1984, the band issued the UK-only single \"Hollow Horse\", which flopped (though it later became a live favourite in the band's sets). A series of follow-up singles similarly missed the charts, including the Motown-flavoured \"All The Daughters\" and the folk-rock inspired \"Seven Horses\". Added to the live line-up around this time was keyboardist Chris \"Tugsie\" Turrill; Turrill was not an official member of the band, and did not play on any of their recordings. Prior to Turrill's arrival, both McNabb and Layhe had previously doubled up on instruments playing guitar, keyboard and percussion at live gigs. Layhe was often seen playing the octobans and McNabb occasionally played an open tuned guitar with his right hand and a keyboard with his left.\nThe band's second LP, The Small Price of a Bicycle came out in mid-1985. The album was a UK-only release—their US label, Arista Records, dismissed the album as 'punk-rock demos' and declined to release it.  \nBeginning in 1986, though the band was still officially a trio, keyboardist Dave Green became an auxiliary member of The Icicle Works, replacing Turrill. Green both played at live shows and contributed to the band's recordings.\nIn early 1986, Beggars' Banquet compiled all the 12\" mixes of the band's singles onto a UK-only LP entitled Seven Singles Deep, which hit No. 52 on the UK Albums Chart.\nIn July 1986, The Icicle Works had a UK chart hit with the almost punk-sounding \"Understanding Jane\", which peaked at No. 52. The song was later covered by The Wildhearts on their 2008 covers album Stop Us If You've Heard It Before, vol. 1.\nThe pop-oriented follow-up single \"Who Do You Want For Your Love\" peaked at No. 54, and January 1987's \"Evangeline\" peaked at No. 53.  All three songs found their way on to the 1987 album If You Want to Defeat Your Enemy Sing His Song, produced by Ian Broudie. The album was released in both Britain and North America and hit No. 28 on the UK Albums Chart.\nLater in 1987, The Icicle Works issued the single \"High Time\". It peaked at No. 76 in the UK, but in 1988 it hit No. 13 on the newly created US Modern Rock chart.\nThe band's fourth studio album, Blind, was produced by McNabb and issued in 1988, and reached the Top 40 of the album chart. The album featured 13 tracks in the UK and Canada, but the US version of the album featured a different track listing, slightly edited versions of a few songs, and a different cover. Still, both versions of the album contained \"High Time\" and the minor British hit \"Little Girl Lost\", which peaked at No. 59.\n\n\n=== 1989–1991: New line-up and split ===\nBy the late 1980s, tensions within the group were increasing, allegedly due to McNabb's controlling ways. By 1988, in addition to writing virtually all of The Icicle Works' material (as well as singing and playing guitar) McNabb was producing the group's records.\nShortly after Blind was issued, drummer Chris Sharrock departed to The La's. Sharrock would later join The Lightning Seeds and World Party, and would drum for Robbie Williams, Del Amitri, Eurythmics, Oasis and Beady Eye. As of 2018 he is the drummer for Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. Layhe also departed at this time. Beggars Banquet subsequently dropped the group from their roster.\nMcNabb continued to perform under the name The Icicle Works for a while. Dave Green was promoted to official membership status, although he left the band within a year. Zak Starkey was added on drums for a time, and various keyboardists, bassists, and guitarists passed through before the band released their final album Permanent Damage (1990), recorded for Epic/Sony. By that time, the band's line-up was McNabb, bassist Roy Corkill, former 10cc and Jethro Tull drummer Paul Burgess, keyboardist Dave Baldwin, and backing vocalist Mark Revell. \n\n\"The reason Permanent Damage was an Icicle Works album was because Muff Winwood, who signed me to Epic, wanted a brand name that he knew was dependable, and wasn’t very keen on me just becoming Ian McNabb. But it was effectively a solo album.\" - Ian McNabb/\nThis 'second-generation' version of The Icicle Works broke up after Permanent Damage failed to chart, and Epic dropped the band. McNabb's solo career officially began in 1991 with the release of the single \"Great Dreams of Heaven\".\nIn 1992, a compilation called The Best of The Icicle Works was released, containing the best of their work from the Beggars Banquet years. Two years later, a live recording of a 1987 concert was issued.\n\n\n=== 2006–present: Revival ===\n\nAfter having been a solo act for 15 years, in 2006 McNabb reactivated The Icicle Works name for a series of six UK concerts in October of that year. This version of the band consisted of McNabb, former 'second-generation' Icicle Works bassist Roy Corkill, and two new members: keyboard player Richard Naiff and drummer Mathew Priest, both of McNabb's long-time solo touring band.\nThe Icicle Works appeared at GuilFest 2007 and played a nine-date UK tour in December 2007. McNabb and company played two free shows as 'The Icicle Works' in Liverpool in January 2008.\nMcNabb continued to play gigs as a solo artist throughout 2009 and 2010. After a three-year hiatus from performing, The Icicle Works played a series of 30th Anniversary gigs in 2011.  Gigs took place sporadically through the rest of the decade, before group activity wound down temporarily in 2022.\nIn 2024, Layhe officially rejoined The Icicle Works after a 35-year absence.  Now consisting solely of McNabb and Layhe, the band undertook a series of acoustic gigs performing as a duo.\nRoy Corkill died in August 2024.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent\n\nIan McNabb – guitar, lead vocals, keyboards (1980–1990, 2006–present)\nChris Layhe – bass, backing vocals (1980–1988, 2024–present)\n\nFormer\n\nChris Sharrock – drums (1981–1988)\nZak Starkey – drums (1988)\nDave Green – keyboards (1986-1988)\nDave Baldwin – keyboards (1989–1990)\nGed Lynch – drums (1989)\nMark Revell – backing vocals (1990)\nPaul Burgess – drums (1990)\nRoy Corkill – bass (1988–1990, 2006–2022; died 2024)\nRichard Naiff – keyboards (2006–2022)\nMathew Priest – drums (2006–2022)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nThe Icicle Works (1984)\nThe Small Price of a Bicycle (1985)\nIf You Want to Defeat Your Enemy Sing His Song (1987)\nBlind (1988)\nPermanent Damage (1990)\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWhitburn, Joel (1987).

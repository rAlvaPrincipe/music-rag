    "text": "Voice of the Beehive were an Anglo-American alternative pop rock band formed in London in 1986. \nThe group featured Californian lead vocalist sisters Tracey Bryn and Melissa Brooke Belland (daughters of The Four Preps singer Bruce Belland). They teamed with British musicians Mike Jones, Martin Brett, and Daniel Woodgate – a former member of Madness. The band took their name from the Greek meaning of the name Melissa, meaning honey bee.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe band had five Top 40 singles from two albums in the UK. Their biggest commercial success came with the singles \"I Say Nothing\", \"Don't Call Me Baby\", \"Monsters and Angels\" and \"I Think I Love You\", taken from albums Let It Bee and Honey Lingers. Sex & Misery, a third album, was released in 1996; by this point sisters Tracey and Melissa were the sole group members. The band reformed in 2003 to play a two-week UK tour.\nThe members of Voice of the Beehive have continued to perform sporadically but still release albums, singles & merchandise. Tracey Bryn is a teacher in Laguna Beach, California. Melissa Belland runs her own company Made in Heaven, also in Laguna Beach. Martin Brett ran Brett Dempsey Music Productions in London and joined I, Ludicrous on bass guitar in 2008. In 2011, he released his first solo single \"Lover's Lane\" under his original punk name Brett Martini. He also trained to become a facial hair specialist for film, theatre, and television in 2010.

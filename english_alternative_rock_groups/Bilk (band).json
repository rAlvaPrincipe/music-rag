    "text": "Bilk are an English indie rock trio formed in Chelmsford, Essex, consisting of Sol Abrahams on vocals and guitar, Luke Hare on bass, and Harry Gray on drums. After debuting in 2018 and going on to release a number of singles and EPs, the band released their self-titled debut album in 2023.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe concept was developed in 2015 by vocalist and guitarist Sol Abrahams, who spent two years working with different musicians. Abrahams took inspiration for the name from his father's job as a London cab driver. Abrahams met Luke Hare through an early gig and invited him to join in 2017 when Bilk's initial bassist quit. They had another drummer before happening upon Harry Gray, forming the current trio. \nIn an interview, Abrahams said of his string of former Bilk bandmates:\n\nI was doing Bilk with other musicians for a couple years before I even met Luke and Harry. Shit didn't work out with those guys for various reasons. We went through about six different drummers because I could never get along with them and the one bass player I had before Luke fucked off to become a lawyer or something.\nI knew Luke because he came to one of my early gigs and I met him briefly after the show. He then later came round for a rehearsal. We both liked Harrington jackets and early Green Day so we got on pretty well. Then it was me, Luke, and this other drummer for a bit but shit went tits up with him so that's where we found Harry.\n\nBilk officially debuted in 2018 with the singles \"Give Up\", \"Spiked\", \"Next Weekend\", and \"Slob\". That summer, they played at RiZe Festival.\nIn 2019, Bilk self-released their debut EP titled Chipped Out. They had gigs at Bearded Theory and Reeperbahn Festival. The single \"I Got Knocked Out the Same Night England Did\", written during the 2018 FIFA World Cup, was released ahead of the UEFA Euro 2020.\nBilk signed with Scruff of the Neck Records, through which they released their second EP Allow It in 2021. That summer, they played at Louis Tomlinson's inaugural Away From Home Festival, founded to celebrate the return of live music. The following year, they would reunite with Tomlinson as one of the opening acts on the UK leg of his self-titled world tour. They also embarked on their own tour in late 2021 and early 2022. In summer 2022, they played the Great Escape Festival and Reading and Leeds Festivals. They released their third EP Just Don't Work For Me.\nIn 2023, Bilk released their self-titled debut album, which was recorded on a farm outside Manchester. They went on tour of the UK to celebrate the album's release. They also played SXSW, London Calling, 2000trees, Truck Festival, Tramlines Festival, Y Not Festival, and Reading and Leeds once again. There were further tour dates in late 2023.\nBilk's sophomore album Essex, Drugs and Rock and Roll is set to be released in January 2025 followed their largest tour to date, starting February and traveling around the UK and then Europe.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nBilk have cited the likes of The Jam, Arctic Monkeys, Jamie T, The Streets, the Sex Pistols, Nirvana, and John Cooper Clarke as the band's inspirations. Green Day, Oasis, Slowthai, and Dizzee Rascal were also named as formative influences. Abrahams described their second EP Allow It as combining 90s punk with old school hip-hop. Lyrically, Bilk delve into both personal stories and social commentary. The track \"Stand Up\" from Bilk explicitly criticises the Conservative government.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nBilk (2023)\nEssex, Drugs and Rock and Roll (2025)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nChipped Out (2019)\nAllow It (2021)\nBilk Unplugged (2023)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nGive Up (2018)\nSpiked (2018)\nNext Weekend (2018)\nSlob (2018)\nCM2 (2019)\nWeed Song (2019)\nIn Your Car (2020)\nI Got Knocked Out the Same Night England Did (2020)\nStop Pranging Out (2020)\nBad News (2021)\nLove Is No Easy Game (2021)\nBilly Big Bollocks (2021)\nDaydreamer (2022)\nHummus and Pitta (2022)\nBe Someone (2022)\nJust Don't Work for Me (2022)\nFashion (2022)\nSomething (2023)\nRNR (2023)\nF Up (2024)\nOn It (2024)\nSummer Days (2024)\n\n\n== References =="

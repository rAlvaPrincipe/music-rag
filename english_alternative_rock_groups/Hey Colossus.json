    "text": "Hey Colossus is an English rock band formed in London in 2003. Since its inception, the band has undergone several lineup changes, revolving around founding members Joe Thompson and Robert Davis.\nThe band is characterised by its ‘heavy’ sound, DIY ethic, prolific output, and stylistic experimentation.\n\n\n== History ==\nHey Colossus was formed by childhood friends Joe Thompson and Robert Davis in 2003, together with Ian Scanlon, Tim Hall and James Parker. Their debut album, Hey Colossus Hates You, was released on the band’s own Jonson Family label in 2004. They have since released a further ten studio albums and various splits, singles and EPs on a number of labels.\nBy 2008, the lineup had stabilised around Thompson and Davis together with vocalist Paul Sykes, drummer Rhys Llewellyn, and guitarists Jonathan Richards and Tim Farthing. This incarnation would produce some of the band’s most stylistically diverse work.\nFollowing the departure of Richards, Hey Colossus were joined by Tim’s brother Roo Farthing for the 2017 album The Guillotine, their most refined and politicised record to date.\nAfter extensive touring to promote The Guillotine, the Farthing brothers left the band to pursue other projects (Reigns and Henry Blacker). They were replaced by Will Pearce of the Bristol noise rock band Pohl.\nIn July 2018, Hey Colossus played a 15th anniversary show at the Moth Club in Hackney, London. A limited-edition live album was available to buy on the night.\nA twelfth album, titled Four Bibles, was released in May 2019 on ALTER. This was followed the next year by the 75-minute double album Dances/Curses, released on bass player Joe Thompson's Wrong Speed Records in the UK, and Learning Curve in the US. Featuring guest vocals by Mark Lanegan on lead song The Mirror, Dances/Curses was named 2020 Album Of The Year by The Quietus.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nHey Colossus’ early output can be classified as sludge metal with elements of noise rock. Each new record has seen the band embrace wider influences while retaining the ‘heavy’ sound that has become their trademark.\nToday, the band’s music combines elements of noise rock, post-punk, hardcore punk, sludge metal, drone music, electronic music, psychedelic rock and krautrock.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nRobert Davis - guitar\nRhys Llewellyn - drums\nWill Pearce - backing vocals, guitar\nChris Summerlin - guitar\nPaul Sykes - lead vocals\nJoe Thompson - bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nHey Colossus Hates You (2004, 12\" LP & CD) - Jonson Family\nHey Colossus II (2005, 12\" LP & CD) - Jonson Family, Shifty Records, Wakusei Records\nProject: Death (2007, 12\" LP & CD) - Jonson Family, Shifty Records, Wakusei Records, Rimbaud Records, Underhill Records\nHappy Birthday (2008, CD; 2017, 12\" LP) - Riot Season\nEurogrumble Vol. 1 (2010, 12\" LP) - Riot Season\nDominant Male (2010, 12\" LP, CD & cassette) - Clan Destine Records, No Lite\nRRR (2011, 12\" LP & CD) - Riot Season\nCuckoo Live Life Like Cuckoo (2013, 12\" LP & CD) - MIE Music\nIn Black And Gold (2015, 12\" LP, CD & cassette) - Rocket Recordings, Cactus Records\nRadio Static High (2015, 12\" LP & CD) - Rocket Recordings\nThe Guillotine (2017, 12\" LP & CD) - Rocket Recordings\nLive At Magasin4 (2018, 12\" LP) - self-released\nFour Bibles (2019, 12\" LP & CD) - ALTER\nDances/Curses (2020, 12\" LP & CD) - Wrong Speed Records (UK), Learning Curve (US)\nIn Blood (2023, 12\" LP & CD) - Wrong Speed Records\n\n\n== References =="

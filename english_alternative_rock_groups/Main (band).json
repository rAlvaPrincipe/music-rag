    "text": "Main were a British band formed in 1991 by guitarists Robert Hampson and Scott Dowson, both formerly of the English rock band Loop. Drawing on that group's experimentation with drones and guitar texture, the duo moved further into ambient sound, eventually abandoning traditional percussion and rhythm altogether. They released a number of albums and EPs to critical praise in the 1990s. Dawson left the group in 1996.\nIn 2006, Hampson announced that Main had effectively been disbanded in favour of his solo work. In October 2010, he announced that he would be reactivating Main as a more collaborative process with other sound artists. In 2011, the German composer Stephan Mathieu joined Hampson for a current incarnation of the project.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles, EPs ===\nHydra (12\" single 1991)\nCalm (12\" EP 1992)\nDry Stone Feed (12\" mini LP/CD 1992)\nFirmament (CD 1993)\nCore (7\" single 1994) – limited edition of 300 copies, later released on the Ligature CD\nLigature – Remixes (12\" EP 1994)\nFirmament II (CD 1994)\n\"Coderays\" (7\" single 1995) – limited edition of 100 copies\nHertz 1 – Corona (12\"/mini CD 1995)\nHertz 2 – Terminus (12\"/mini CD 1995)\nHertz 3 – Maser (12\"/mini CD 1995)\nHertz 4 – Haloform (12\"/mini CD 1995)\nHertz 5 – Kaon (12\"/mini CD 1995)\nHertz 6 – Neper (12\"/mini CD 1995)\nFirmament III (EP/CD 1996)\nDeliquescence (CD 1997) – live\nFirmament IV (EP/CD 1998)\nTransiency (mini CD – 2003)\nAblation (Editions Mego – 2013)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nMotion Pool (3LP/CD 1994)\nHydra-Calm (LP/CD 1995) – re-issue of \"Hydra\" and \"Calm\", plus one inedit\nLigature – Remixes (CD 1995) – re-issue, contains three extra tracks (the \"Core\" 7\" single)\nHz (3LP/2CD 1996) – re-issue of the whole \"Hertz Project\"\nFirmament III & IV (3 cd 1999) – re-issue of the Firmament III and Firmament IV EPs plus Deliquecence\nTau (CD – 2002)\nExosphere Exosphere (CD – 2003)\nSurcease (2006)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ambient music artists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRobert Hampson discography"

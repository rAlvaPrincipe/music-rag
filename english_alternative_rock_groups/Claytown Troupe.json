The line up changed in late 1987, and a new set of songs was written which became the album 'Through The Veil'\nAfter recruiting guitarist Adrian Bennett & bassist Paul Waterson they played as supporting act such as Salvation, Lightning Strikes.\nDuring the summer of 1988 the band were included, along with The Wedding Present, The Trudy & The Hunters Club, on a 4-track EP on the cover of House of Dolls magazine, plus filmed a promotional video for the song Prayer.\n\n\n== Island Records – 1988 – 1991 ==\nIn September 1988 they signed to Island Records by Ron Fair, who also produced the debut album, Through the Veil with extra mixes by Ralph Jezzard.\nWith a major record deal behind them but no manager, they met small label owner Steve 'Abbo' Abbott (ex.UK Decay vocalist) and decided a sixth member rather an established team would help build the band, so asked him to switch to management for them.\nThe album was released in October 1989, reaching No. 72 on the UK Albums Chart .\n'Through the Veil spawned three top 100 UK singles – \"Prayer\" UK 79, \"Hey Lord\" UK 86 and \"Real Life\" UK 85.\nThey were played as support band for The Cult's Sonic Temple tour at Wembley Arena and Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre.\nLater they toured with Pearl Jam, The Wonder Stuff, The Damned, Julian Cope, Jesus Jones, The Godfathers, and The Mission, as well as playing the Los Angeles Foundations Forum, which also featured Ozzy Osbourne and Soundgarden.\nThe band were dropped from Island Records after the company was sold to Polygram. Subsequently they signed to EMI Records USA, where the second album Out There (1991), was produced by David Bianco at New York's The Hit Factory.\n\n\n== EMI Records – 1991 – 1992 ==\n'Out There' spawned two top 75 UK singles – \"Ways of Love\" UK No. 57, \"Wanted It All\" UK No. 74.\nIn 1992 as guests of Pearl Jam on their Ten Tour the band were transferred to EMI UK after the US label was taken over by Zomba.\n\n\n== Reformation – 2004 ==\nIn 2004, they were invited to perform at the Whitby Gothic Weekend, this creating a renewed interest in the band, they then played a handful of gigs in late 2004 with interim members Clive Murray (guitar), Chris Sharp (bass) and Dan Roth (drums).\nIn 2008, the band were guests of The Mission's at the Shepherd's Bush Empire.\n\n\n== 2013 ==\nSaw the band joined by drummer Phil Martini (Waywood Sons, Spear Of Destiny (band) and Joe Elliott's Down 'n' Outz) to play the Camden Rocks festival with Headliners The Rifles & Therapy?.\n\n\n== 2014 ==\nThe band played the Bristol Fleece, 22 years since their last hometown gig.\n\n\n== 2018 ==\nBristol Archive Records released the original 1988 demos.\n\n\n== 2024 ==\nClaytown will be part of the bill with The Mission and The Chameleons  at the 'From the oyster comes the pearl' alternative rock festival in Dubai on the 23 of November.\nAs a warm-up for the festival, Claytown Troupe played a ten song setlist at Holroyd Arms in Guilford on September 29,2024.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Prayer\" (1989) No. 78\n\"Hey Lord\" (1989) No. 86\n\"Real Life\" (1990) No. 85\n\"Ways of Love\" (1990) – UK No. 57\n\"Wanted It All\" (1992) – UK No. 74\n'Skybound' (1992) Unreleased\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThrough the Veil (1989) (Island) – UK No. 72\nOut There (1991) (EMI)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bands from England\nList of bands from Bristol\nCulture of Bristol\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site"

    "text": "Magoo are an English indie rock band which formed in Norfolk, England in 1992.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe band's influences include Guided by Voices, Stereolab, Pavement, the Flaming Lips and John Peel, and spent their early years playing local venues in the Norwich area.\nHaving released several singles on Norwich's Noisebox Records, they were signed by the Scottish record label, Chemikal Underground.\nDuring their time with Chemikal Underground, Magoo played at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York and the Glastonbury Festival, as well as smaller events around the UK.\nIn June 1996, the band recorded four songs in session for the John Peel show on BBC Radio 1. They went on to record a further six sessions and were one of the last bands to record a session before Peel's untimely death.\nThe band subsequently parted company with Chemikal Underground and set up their own studio Sickroom Studios, in the heart of Norfolk to record their new material in.

Since 2003, they have used the name That Fucking Tank.\nThey have performed in the UK and Europe with other bands that play their style of music including Yourcodenameis:milo, Lightning Bolt, Oxes, Melt Banana and Don Caballero.\nIn 2008, the duo played Reading and Leeds Festivals.\nIn November 2013, the band played a UK-wide tour with Foals. A nod to their connection with Foals' former band The Edmund Fitzgerald which emerged from the same scene and era.\nThe band have released four albums through independent record labels of the north of England.\n\n\n== Obscene Baby Auction ==\nThe members of That Fucking Tank along with Giles Bailey and Graham Pilling started their own record label, Obscene Baby Auction, in 2001; its first incarnation running until 2007. It has released EPs and albums by That Fucking Tank, Kill Yourself, Bilge Pump and others.\n\n\n== Related bands ==\nThe band's two members are notable musicians outside of their music in That Fucking Tank.

A year later, Drowned in Sound described them as \"... Britain’s answer to US noise rock duos like Hella and Lightning Bolt\".\nAlthough they act through anti-commercial channels, their records have been reviewed by national music press, such as the NME, The Skinny, and The Quietus.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nMaking a Meal for Beethoven on Old Baby Sex Scene compilation – Obscene Baby Auction (2004)\nThe Day Of Death By Bono Adrenaline Shock – Jealous Records (2006)\nOwl End on Stench of Muscle compilation (2008)\nTanknology – Gringo Records (2009)\nNWONWOBH split 10-inch – Brew Records (2011)\nTFT – Gringo Records CD, vinyl self-release on Obscene Baby Auction Records (2012)\nA Document Of The Last Set – Gringo Records, Vinyl/MP3 (2013)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nDocument of the First Set EP – Jealous Records (2004)\nAndrew and James on split 7-inch with Grabba Grabba Tape – Gssh Gssh/OBA (2005)\nRed by King Crimson split 7-inch with Monster Killed by Laser – Run of the Mill Records (2005)\nAwesome Magnet (with Giles Bailey) picture disc 7-inch with Euro tour DVD – On the Bone Records (2007)\n\n\n== References =="

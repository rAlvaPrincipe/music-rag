    "text": "Bombay Bicycle Club is an English indie rock band from Crouch End, London, consisting of Jack Steadman, Jamie MacColl, Suren de Saram, and Ed Nash. They are guitar-fronted and have experimented with different genres, including folk, electronica, world music and indie rock.\nThe band was given the opening slot on 2006's V Festival after winning a competition. They subsequently released two EPs and their debut single \"Evening/Morning\". Since then, the band has released five albums including So Long, See You Tomorrow which topped the album charts in February 2014. The band has toured worldwide as a headlining act, playing North America, Australia, Europe and Asia.\nIn January 2016, the four members announced that they would pursue solo projects. Nash recorded music under the name Toothless, and released his debut album in early 2017. Frontman Steadman, under the name Mr Jukes, released his debut album in 2017.\nIn January 2019, Bombay Bicycle Club announced their return to making new music and performing live after a three-year hiatus: \"Since late last year we've been getting back into the swing of playing music together. More than anything it just felt great to be in the same room playing again. It made us realise what a good thing we have and has given us renewed energy and enthusiasm for the future\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings (2005–2006) ===\nSteadman, MacColl (son of former Bible/Liberty Horses guitarist/producer/session player Neill MacColl, nephew of singer Kirsty MacColl and grandson of folk singers Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger) and de Saram (son of Sri Lankan cellist Rohan de Saram) met at age 15 as students at University College School, Hampstead (in the same year as the members of the band Cajun Dance Party), and began playing under the name The Canals after performing together in a school assembly, with an additional keyboardist. They switched between various aliases until they picked Bombay Bicycle Club, named after a (now defunct) chain of Indian restaurants in North London. The line-up changed regularly until the summer of 2006, when Nash (a student at Camden School for Girls), joined the band after they met him at a funeral. Initially they played gigs at small London venues such as The Old Blue Last, Lark in the Park and Jacksons Lane (as well as winning Exeter's Got Talent 2009). They released demos of their music on Myspace, with early versions of \"The Hill\" and \"Autumn\" as well as the song, \"City Lights\".\nThe band was entered into Virgin Mobile's \"Road to V\" competition on Channel 4 in 2006. They were announced as one of two winners of the competition on 16 August 2006, beating competition from fellow London band - and favourites to win the competition - The Holloways in the final round of fourteen bands. Previous participants include The Young Knives, who were winners of the inaugural competition one year before. They were given the opening slot of the 2006 V Festival, playing on the Channel 4 Stage in Chelmsford on 19 August, before opening the Staffordshire site the following day.\n\n\n=== The Boy I Used to Be and How We Are (2007–2008) ===\nOn 16 May 2007, NME published an article naming Bombay Bicycle Club \"...the hottest band to come from North London for quite some time\". Bombay Bicycle Club released their debut EP, The Boy I Used to Be, on 12 February 2007. The band released it on their own independent record label, Mmm... Records. The EP was produced by Jim Abbiss at his own personal request, and was recorded and mixed by Ewan Davies at Lincolnshire's Chapel Studios. To support the release of the EP they played a headline show at the Dingwalls in Camden as well as supporting fellow \"Road to V\" winners The Young Knives across some of their UK Tour. The band also played the Carling Stage at Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2007.\nThe band's second EP, How We Are, was released on 22 October 2007, again through Mmm... Records. It was produced by Jim Abbiss, and recorded and mixed by Richard Wilkinson at Konk Studios. The band headlined their first UK tour in support of this release and the EP debuted at No. 2 on the UK Indie Singles Chart on 5 November 2007.\nAt the beginning of 2008, Bombay Bicycle Club appeared at the third annual Artrocker Festival, the Camden Crawl, and The Great Escape Festival in Brighton. The band also played the Shockwaves NME Awards Show at London's KOKO where they were main support for The Hold Steady.\n\n\n=== I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose (2008–2009) ===\nIn June 2008, all current members of the band finished secondary school education, which meant that they could commit full-time to music – and enjoy freedom from the conflicting responsibilities of being in a band versus education. The band also headlined the first Club NME in Paris at La Fleche D'or venue, where they were supported by Bitchee Bitchee Ya Ya Ya, with DJ sets from South Central, Shitdisco and Vicarious Bliss.\nThe band's first single, \"Evening/Morning\", was released on 4 August 2008 through Young and Lost Club. The single was produced by Jim Abbiss and was recorded and mixed by Richard Wilkinson at The Garden, London. The band embarked on a 23 date UK tour in July and August, including festival appearances at the 2008 Reading and Leeds Festivals, the 2008 T in the Park Festival, The Edge Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland and the second Underage Festival.\nIn September 2008, Bombay Bicycle Club took part in the Levi's Ones to Watch 5 Night Revue at The Macbeth in London. The band headlined the first night with support from Sky Larkin and an interview and highlights from the show were broadcast on Channel 4 on 9 October 2008.\nBombay Bicycle Club's debut album I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose was recorded between late October and late November 2008 at Konk Studios in London. The album was produced by Jim Abbiss. The band also played the Levi's Ones To Watch tour at the end of October, which included dates in Brighton, London, Birmingham, Liverpool, and Glasgow.\nAt the end of 2008, Bombay Bicycle Club signed a deal with Island Records to release future singles and albums with the record label. All releases were to be published through the Mmm...Records/Island Records offprint, the first release being the single \"Always Like This\". The single was released in April 2009 and reached No. 97 on the UK Singles Chart. The band toured throughout April in support of the release.\nSpeaking to The Indiependent in 2020, Nash said: \"I would say it's probably our most honest record, and a very good account of being aged 14 to 18.\"\n\n\n=== Flaws (2010–2011) ===\nOn 9 May 2010, Bombay Bicycle Club released the track \"Ivy & Gold\" in the United Kingdom as a digital download.

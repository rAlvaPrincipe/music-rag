    "text": "A.C. Temple were an alternative rock band from Sheffield, England, formed in 1985. They released four albums before splitting up in 1991.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band were formed in 1985 by guitarist Noel Kilbride (guitar) and Neil Woodward (bass) with Jayne Waterfall (drums) and vocalist Dave Giles. Andy Hartley (bass) joined the following year with Jane Bromley taking over vocals. Mixing industrial noise with guitars and effects, they were compared in their early days to the likes of The Birthday Party and Sonic Youth. The band's first two albums, Songs of Praise and Blowtorch, were released on the Further label, subsequently signing to Blast First. They recorded a session for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show in 1987. Guitarist Paul Dorrington joined in 1987 but departed the following year to form Tse Tse Fly. With bassist Chris Trout (formerly of Kilgore Trout), guitarist Tim Beckham and drummer Mat Silcox on board, the band released their third album, Sourpuss, in 1989. A final effort, Belinda Backwards, was released in 1991, before the band split up.\nTrout later worked with former Pale Saints member Ian Masters in Spoonfed Hybrid.\nDorrington went on to join The Wedding Present, staying with the band between 1991 and 1995. He later also played on Cha Cha Cohen's debut single.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nJane Bromley - vocals (1987-)\nNoel Kilbride - guitars\nJayne Waterfall - drums (1985–1988)\nNeil Woodward - guitars  (1985–1988)\nAndy Hartley - bass  (1986–1988)\nPaul Dorrington - guitars (1987–1988)\nTim Beckham - guitars (1989–1991)\nChris Trout - bass (1989–1991)\nMatt Silcox - drums (1989–1991)\nDave Giles - vocals (1985–1987)\nRoss Orton- drums (1990-1991)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSongs of Praise (1987) Further\n\"Ulterior\" / \"Make Mine Music\" / \"A Motel in Kansas\" / \"Fear No More the Heat of the Sun\" / \"All Hail Discordia\" / \"90 Seconds\"\nBlowtorch (1988) Further\n\"Mincemeat\" / \"Yield\" / \"I Dream of Fraud\" / \"American\" / \"Weekend\" / \"Sheikh\" / \"Chinese Burn\" / \"Shimmer Queen\" / \"Hank\" / \"Armache\"\nSourpuss (1989) Blast First\n\"Sundown Pet Corner\" / \"Miss Sky\" / \"Stymied\" / \"Mother Tongue\" / \"Crayola\" / \"Devil You Know\" / \"Horsetrading\" / \"A Mouthful\" / \"Faith in a Windsock\"\nBelinda Backwards (1991) Blast First\n\"Glitterhall\" / \"Silver Swimmer\" / \"Half-Angel\" / \"Come Sunrise\" / \"Girlseye\" / \"Lifesize\" / \"Spacebore\" / \"Skyhooks\" / \"Baby Seals\" / \"P2\"\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Miss Sky\" (1989) (flexi-disc with The Catalogue magazine - split with Beme Seed)\n\"Miss Sky\"/\"Undercurrent\" (1993) Ablaze!

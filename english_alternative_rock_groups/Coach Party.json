    "text": "Coach Party is a British four-piece indie rock band formed in the Isle of Wight, England in 2019. The band is composed of lead singer and bassist Jess Eastwood, guitarists Joe Perry and Steph Norris, and drummer Guy Page.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Coach Party ===\nBefore forming Coach Party, the band performed under the name Jeph and released three songs: \"Hey Baby\" (2018), \"Harry\" (2018), and \"Lola\" (2019).\n\n\n=== Coach Party (2019–present) ===\nChess Club Records signed the newly named Coach Party in 2019, and the band re-released their previous single \"Lola\" as \"Oh Lola\" in November 2019.\nIn early 2020, the band began releasing singles leading up to the eventual release of their debut EP Party Food, released in June of that year on Chess Club Records. The Guardian Damien Morris reviewed the album and called the band \"poppy, witty and experimental,\" further saying they \"are far more interesting than a cursory listen suggests\". Morris explained, \"Plenty of new indie bands become less interesting the more you hear them, but Coach Party, like the Isle of Wight, are more intriguing than they first appear.\" NME highlighted how the band tackles difficult subjects, such \"as self-hatred, tricky relationships and confronting one’s own inner demons in their lyrics,\" which NME claims, \"when paired with their joyous, pint-spilling brand of indie rock, it’s a combination that so often works wonders\".\n\n\n== Band members ==\nJess Eastwood – lead vocals, bass guitar\nJoe Perry – guitar\nSteph Norris – guitar\nGuy Page – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Oh Lola\" (2019)\n\"Breakdown\" (2020)\n\"Space\" (2020)\n\"Bags\" (2020)\n\"Can't Talk, Won't\" (2020)\n\"Really OK on My Own\" (2020)\n\"Wonderful Christmastime\" (2020)\n\"Everybody Hates Me\" (2021)\n\"FLAG (Feel Like a Girl)\" (2021)\n\"Weird Me Out\" (2022)\n\"Micro Aggression\" (2023)\n\"All I Wanna Do Is Hate\" (2023)\n\"Born Leader\" (2023)\n\"What's the Point in Life\" (2023)\n\"Parasite\" (2023)\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== References =="

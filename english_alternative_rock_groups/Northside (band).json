    "text": "Northside are an English alternative rock band from Blackley and Moston in north Manchester, England. Formed in 1989, they released their only album, Chicken Rhythms, on Factory Records in 1991. The band became part of the 1990s Madchester/baggy/indie-rave scene.\n\n\n== Career ==\nNorthside was formed by Warren \"Dermo\" Dermody (vocals/lyrics) and Cliff Ogier (bass). They were later joined by Michael Upton (guitar) and Paul Walsh (drums). Upton was replaced by Timmy Walsh before the release of their first single, \"Shall We Take a Trip\".\n\n\n=== Chart success ===\n\"Shall We Take a Trip\" was banned by the BBC for its many references to drugs (specifically LSD), but despite the lack of airplay it eventually broke into the Top 50 in the UK Singles Chart.\nThe next single from Chicken Rhythms, \"My Rising Star\", was released in October 1990 and reached No. 32, staying on the chart for 7 weeks.\nThe album itself peaked at No. 19 in June 1991. It was produced by Ian Broudie.\nIn 1991, Northside scored a minor hit in the United States when their single \"Take 5\" reached No. 5 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart for the week of 5 October. It also reached No. 34 on the Dance/Club Play Songs charts that same month. The band performed \"Take 5\" on Top of the Pops on 6 June 1991, a rare occasion where a song that was not in the Top 40 was played on the show. That week the single was at No.41 and would peak at No.40.\n\n\n=== Second album and breakup ===\nA second album was recorded, with a planned release date and a catalogue number for the first single \"Want a Virgin\", however Northside's label Factory Records declared bankruptcy in November 1992 and the band split up.\n\n\n=== Post-split ===\nIn 2003, Dermo and Ogier formed the band Silent Partners, with drummer Malc Law and guitarist Danny Yates; however Ogier left and was replaced by Dom Morrison. The band toured extensively in the UK, opening for Happy Mondays.\nDrummer Paul Walsh went on to record and tour with Manchester rock outfit Sons of the Stage, releasing an independent LP, Angel Hill.\nIn 2006, Northside played gigs in Leeds and Manchester, however singer Dermo was the only returning original member. Chicken Rhythms was also re-issued in 2006 on LTM Recordings.\nIn 2006, BBC 6 Music played the song \"Shall We Take a Trip\" in its entirety on the Marc Riley show, and again on the Steve Lamacq show in 2016 as part of the My Generation series on 1989. \"Shall We Take a Trip\" was also used as Granada's Soccer Night theme tune throughout the 1990s.\nDermo formed V Thirteen in March 2011 with Matt Rynn, Doug McCloud and Miz DeShannon. V Thirteen is named after a song by Big Audio Dynamite.\n\n\n=== Reunion ===\nIn late 2013, Northside announced that they were reforming with all four original members. They toured England in April and May 2014.\nIn 2017, Dermo went solo with his debut single \"Vultures\" on Eromeda Records.\nTim Walsh worked as a sound engineer for 25 years, on shows such as Brookside and Hollyoaks. He died on 19 August 2019.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\nVinyl Releases on Factory Records:\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1991: Chicken Rhythms FAC 310 – UK No. 19\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1990: \"Shall We Take a Trip\" / \"Moody Places\" FAC 268 (12\")\n1990: \"Shall We Take a Trip\" / \"Moody Places\" FAC 268/7 (7\") – UK No. 50\n1990: \"My Rising Star\"* / Instrumental FAC 298 (12\")\n1990: \"My Rising Star\" / Instrumental FAC 298/7 (7\") – UK No. 32\n1991: \"Take 5\"* / \"Who's to Blame\" (Instrumental) FAC 308 (12\")\n1991: \"Take 5\" / \"Who's to Blame\" (Instrumental) FAC 308-7 (7\") – UK No. 40\n* longer version.\n\n\n=== Videos ===\n1991: \"Live\"\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\"Shall We Take a Trip\"\n\"My Rising Star\"\n\"Take 5\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMadchester – The Sound of the North (Northside Rehearsal)\nVideo for \"Take 5\"\nITV Chart Show Indie Chart April 1991 – featuring \"Take 5\"\nVideo for \"My Rising Star\""

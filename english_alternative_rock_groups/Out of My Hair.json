    "text": "Out of My Hair are an English pop/alternative rock band, primarily active in the mid 1990s. The band consisted of Simon Eugene, also known as Comfort (vocals, guitar, bass, piano, keyboards), Sean Elliot (guitar), Kenny Rumbles (drums) and George Muranyi (keyboards).  Their single \"Mister Jones\" entered the UK Singles Chart peaking at number 73.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe early version of the band was formed in 1991 by Eugene. Early membership included Barny C. Rockford (who later became a member of The Auteurs) on drums. The band performed several gigs in the UK and Amsterdam, but did not release any records.\nIn late 1993 Eugene, feeling that \"the chemistry of the band didn't seem right\", decided to reform it. Elliot remained on guitar, Rockford was replaced by Kenny Rumbles, Eugene replaced Jake on bass and John George joined the band as another guitarist.\nIn June 1994 their first single was released, featuring two songs: \"In the Groove Again\" and \"River of Gold\". In late 1995 the band released their only full album, Drop The Roof. The album was first released in Japan, where it gained a relatively significant success. A UK release followed in early 1996, but it failed to become popular.\nDuring those years, Out of my Hair toured extensively supporting artists including David Bowie, Crash Test Dummies and Barenaked Ladies.\nIn spite of some positive criticism, and a success of the \"In the Groove Again\" single, the band remained unknown to the wide public and quietly disappeared around 1997 when Simon went solo using his performing name Comfort. Some further supports followed, notably with Radiohead in Paris and a new album God is in the Detail was ready for release when Comfort's label folded. After appearing at the South by Southwest Festival in early 1999 Comfort all but retired from performing until the mid 2000s when he formed the International Love Corporation.\nMore recently Eugene has returned again with the Out of My Hair name and released a number of new singles, including \"Cream\" and \"The Return EP\", which was featured on Mark Radcliffe's BBC Radio 6 Music show.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Hearts Desire\" (7\", Red) RCA 1994\n\"In The Groove Again\" (7\", Single) RCA 1994\n\"In The Groove Again\" (CD, Single) RCA 1994\n\"Mister Jones\" (CD, Single, Dig) BMG 1995 - UK No. 73\n\"Safe Boy\" (CD, Single) BMG 1995\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nDrop The Roof (CD) BMG Victor Inc. 1995\nDifferent track listing order from the original UK version.

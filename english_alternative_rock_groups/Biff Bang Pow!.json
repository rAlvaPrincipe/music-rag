    "text": "Biff Bang Pow! were an indie pop band from London, England, active between 1983 and 1991, centering on Creation Records boss Alan McGee.\n\n\n== History ==\nGlaswegian Alan McGee had previously been in the band The Laughing Apple, who released three singles in 1981/82. After moving to London, McGee formed a new band, Biff Bang Pow!, taking their name from a song by one of his favourite bands, The Creation.  The first release on Creation records, \"'73 in '83\" by The Legend! came with a flexi-disc featuring Laughing Apple's \"Wouldn't You\", a song that would later appear on the first Biff Bang Pow! album.\nThe initial Biff Bang Pow! line-up was McGee on guitar and vocals, with Dick Green on guitar, Joe Foster on bass, and Ken Popple on drums, these recording the first 2 singles \"50 Years of Fun\" and \"There Must Be A Better Life\".\nDave Evans then replaced Foster (who went solo as Slaughter Joe), and guitarist/organist Andrew Innes (later to join Primal Scream) joined on a part-time basis. Debut album Pass The Paintbrush...Honey was released in early 1985, displaying a mixture of mod, psychedelia, and new wave influences.  1986 saw arguably the band's strongest album The Girl Who Runs The Beat Hotel, which expanded on the first album's psychedelic and sixties pop influences, and featured collaborations with artist/painter JC Brouchard. This album coincided with the peak of the first wave of indie pop and as this gave way to shoegazing and grunge, Creation Records also moved in that direction, with the label increasingly being associated with artists such as My Bloody Valentine and Ride.  With Biff Bang Pow!, however, McGee continued with guitar pop, becoming increasingly melancholy with releases such as Oblivion (1987), Love Is Forever (1988), Songs For The Sad Eyed Girl (1990), and Me (1991), which proved to be the last album proper by the band.  Two compilations, L'Amour, Demure, Stenhousemuir and Debasement Tapes were subsequently released on Creation, with Bertula Bop released in 1994 on the Tristar label. A further collection, Waterbomb, compiled by Joe Foster, was released on Rev-Ola in 2003.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAll on Creation Records except where stated.

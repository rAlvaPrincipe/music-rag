    "text": "Landshapes are a British band formed in 2012, known primarily for its effects-heavy psychedelic alternative rock. They released their debut full-length album Rambutan on indie record label Bella Union in 2013 and their second album, Heyoon, in May 2015. The group consists of Heloise Tunstall-Behrens (vocals, violin) and Luisa Gerstein (vocals, ukulele) with Jemma Freeman (guitar, vocals) and Dan Blackett (drums, vocals). They were formerly known as Lulu and the Lampshades and they met when its members were at the University of Bristol.\nBand members Tunstall-Behrens and Gerstein are known for their revival of the 1931 Carter Family song \"When I'm Gone\" as \"Cups\".\nWhile Landshapes was on hiatus, Gerstein and Tunstall-Behrens remained active with Deep Throat Choir, releasing an album on Bella Union in 2017, and now perform with Blood Moon Project.

In 2016, the band signed to Fiction Records. In March, they released their debut EP, The Road, and the single \"Cupid\". In August 2016, the group released a cover version of Madonna's \"Beautiful Stranger\".\nOn 16 December 2016, the band announced their debut album Love in the 4th Dimension, and released new lead single \"Formidable\".

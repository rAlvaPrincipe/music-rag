The band currently consists of singer-songwriter Kristian Bell, bassist Daniel Rumsey, keyboardist/guitarist Mark Breed and drummer Bhavin Thaker. \nDrummer Gianni Honey left the band in 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\nKristian Bell and Gianni Honey had previously played together in the Crooked Canes in their hometown of Peterborough. Honey was taught by former Morrissey drummer Spike T. Smith and played in local bands.\nFollowing the split of the Crooked Canes, the duo moved to Brighton to attend university and advertised around campus for a bassist. Daniel Rumsey was the only person to respond and joined the band. Rumsey was a singer-songwriter originally from Dorset who had fronted the \"horror punk\" band Fall Victim before moving to Brighton where he fronted Dan Rumsey & the Bitter End and the Voyage Andromeda. Initially called the Witches, the band changed the spelling to Wytches to make their band name more easily found on Google. The band also originally featured second guitarist Mark Breed, with whom Bell later started a side project with called the Mark and Kristian Band.\nThe band released their debut single \"Beehive Queen\" in June 2013 via Hate Hate Hate Records and follow up single \"Robe for Juda\" in November 2013. In September 2013 the band released a low key limited edition cassette Thunder Lizard Revisited. The band released their debut US single \"Crying Clown\" (originally the b-side to the band's debut UK single) via Fat Possum Records in November 2013.\n\n\n=== Annabel Dream Reader (2014–2015) ===\nOn 4 February 2014, the band announced they had signed with Heavenly Recordings and released \"Gravedweller\" as a free digital single. The band also signed to Partisan Records in the US.\nThe band released their debut album Annabel Dream Reader in August 2014. The album was recorded over two days at Toe Rag Studios in Hackney, London and co-produced by Bell and former Coral guitarist Bill Ryder-Jones. The album was recorded and mixed by Luke Oldfield on an 8-track Studer A80. It reached number 50 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\n=== All Your Happy Life (2016–2019) ===\nIn August 2016, Mark Breed re-joined the band as a permanent member.\nThe band released an EP of self recorded songs titled Home Recordings in June 2016. In September 2016 they released their second album All Your Happy Life.\nIn 2018, the band parted ways with their UK record label Heavenly Recordings and US record label Partisan, leaving them unsigned. In March 2019, the band pulled out of a planned UK support tour with Drenge plus several warm up dates, citing \"unforeseen circumstances\". \nIn October 2019, the band played 3 gigs as a 3-piece with Honey replaced by session player Demelza Mather.\n\n\n=== Three Mile Ditch (2020–2022) ===\nIn May 2020, Daniel Rumsey released an EP called The Darkest Day from a new side project called Dan Rumsey & the Dark Days.\nOn 10 June 2020, the band released the single \"Cowboy\" via their own label Cable Code Records. It was also confirmed at this time that Gianni Honey had officially left the band, with Bell stating \"we were disheartened by the whole thing. All the work that goes into getting a band off its feet and into the public felt like something we'd have to try all over again\".\nOn October 2, 2020, the band released their third album Three Mile Ditch via Cable Code Records. \nIn November 2021, Kristian Bell released a solo album Backfire through Cable Code Records.\n\n\n=== Our Guest Can't Be Named (2023-24) ===\nDemelza Mather had toured with the band as a session drummer since Honey's departure in 2019 and was announced as an official member of the group in March 2023.\nIn June 2023, the band announced they had signed to Alcopop!

    "text": "Finlay were a five piece indie rock band from London. The band was formed in 1996 by school friends Adam Straw, Anamik Saha and Christopher Allison. Lorna Crabbe joined in August 1997 (two weeks before their first gig), and Giles Littleford three years later. They released a single and an EP on their own label, Growl Wow Records, before signing with British independent label Fortuna Pop! who released their two albums to critical acclaim. Kerrang! called their debut a \"Ragged and Wonderful sliver of a debut\", while Uncut magazine described Finlay's sound as \"heroic and inspired pop music tuned in from an unearthly frequency\". The band became particularly known for their DIY lo-fi aesthetic, most evident in their earlier recordings.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAdam Straw (guitars, vocals)\nAnamik Saha (drums)\nChristopher Allison (guitars)\nGiles Littleford (bass)\nLorna Crabbe (keyboards, vocals)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nI Dreams & Visions – CD Fortuna Pop!, 2003)\nThe Fall of Mary – CD Fortuna Pop!, 2006)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Little Dancing Solos\" – 7-inch Single (Growl Wow Records, 2000)\n\"Home\" – 7-inch Single, CD Fortuna Pop!, 2003)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nMaladjusted Malarkey – Double 7-inch EP, Finlay contributed the track \"Favourite Chair\" (Full Strength Records, 2001)\nGrowl Wow EP No. 1 – 12-inch EP, Finlay contributed the track \"Theme\" (Growl Wow Records, 2002)\nI am Five, Truck 2003 – CD album, Finlay contributed the track \"Plastic Cowboy\" (Truck Records, 2003)\nBe True to Your School - A Fortuna POP!

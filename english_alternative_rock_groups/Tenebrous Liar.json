    "text": "Since conception as renowned photographer, Steve Gullick's music experiment in 2005, tenebrous LIAR grew to become a four-part rock group and has gone on to record multiple studio albums. Throughout the years tenebrous LIAR has experienced many line up changes with Gullick remaining as the only constant member of the group. The band cites its musical influences to be acts such as Neil Young, Nirvana, The Stooges and The Velvet Underground. In contrast to this, reviewers and critics often describe the music as having a darker tone, using terms such as grimy rock and bleak  to describe the group's music. \nTenebrous Liar have released seven studio albums, the most recent four being released on TV Records, produced by labelmate Richard Warren.\n\n\n== Live ==\nTenebrous Liar have played live with many artists over the years including Foo Fighters, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Soulsavers, The Magic Numbers, Will Oldham, Richard Warren, Josh T.

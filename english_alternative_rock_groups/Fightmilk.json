    "text": "Fightmilk is an indie rock band from London, England. After releasing two EPs, the self-released The Curse of Fightmilk in 2016 and Pity Party on Fierce Panda in 2017, the band released their debut album Not With That Attitude with Reckless Yes in 2018. Their second album Contender, on the same label, was released in 2021. Their output has been compared to Superchunk, Weezer, Kirsty MacColl, and Diet Cig.\n\n\n== History ==\nFightmilk was formed in London in 2015 by Lily Rae (guitar and lead vocals), Alex Wisgard (guitar), Adam Wainwright (bass), and Nick Kiddle (drums).\nThe band experimented, often flippantly, with other names before finally settling on \"Fightmilk\". The name is a reference to a fictional “alcoholic, dairy-based protein drink for bodyguards by bodyguards” that features in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\nAfter self-releasing their debut EP The Curse of Fightmilk in 2016 they caught the attention of longstanding London independent label Fierce Panda who released their second EP, Pity Party in 2017.\nTheir first LP Not With That Attitude, recorded at Dean Street Studios, was released on 31 October 2018 by Derby-based record label Reckless Yes. They returned again to Dean Street for their second album, Contender, which was released 14 May 2021. Between albums original bassist Wainwright left, and was replaced by former Wolf Girl member Healey Becks.\nOn 20 August 2024, after releasing single Summer Bodies the month before, the band announced their third album No Souvenirs would be released on November 15 2024 through Fika Recordings and INH Records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nNot With That Attitude - Reckless Yes, LP, CD, MP3 (2018)\nContender - Reckless Yes, LP, CD, MP3 (2021)\nNo Souvenirs - Fika Recordings / INH Records, LP, CD, MP3 (2024)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nThe Curse of Fightmilk - Self-released, MP3 (2016)\nPity Party - Fierce Panda, MP3 (2017)\nThe FME EP - Self-released, MP3, (2020)\nFightmilk & Cookies - Self-released, MP3 (2020)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nBoth Types of Hayfever - Self-released, CD, MP3 (2018)\n\n\n== References =="

Jack Feerick (Pop Dose) said that the \"Happy Returns\" album was \"currently rockin’ my world down to a nub\" and went on to describe the title track as sounding like \"the Kaiser Chiefs meets The The with vocals by a slumming Peter Murphy\".  Rob Smy (Spinner) compared LIVAN to Placebo and Nine Inch Nails.  However, Patrick Slevin (Aquarian Weekly) described LIVAN's vocals as an \"acquired taste\".\nWriting for the Associated Press, critic Wayne Parry said \"Livan defies easy categorization. His voice has the snarl of Johnny Rotten and the exaggerated bass of Iggy Pop. His shaved head evokes Rob Halford, and his stage presence evokes Freddie Mercury, clad one night in hot pink spandex and combat boots, the next in a leather fringed kilt. And he rocks.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nLivan discography at Discogs\nBand Nation Profile"

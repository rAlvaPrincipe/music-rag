    "text": "The Pigeon Detectives are an English indie rock band from Rothwell in Leeds, West Yorkshire, who formed in 2004. The band have released six albums from 2007 to present.\nThey performed at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2006, where they were tagged \"the band most likely to leap to the main stage in 2007\" in an NME review. The band returned to the festival in 2007 and performed on the main stage in 2011.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Band name ===\nSpeaking about the band's name, the drummer Jimmi Naylor said: \"I never liked the name at first. But it's stuck– and it's probably got us more attention having a silly name. The band were just discussing band names and... came up with 'The Pigeon Detectives'. It became an in-joke but we thought nothing of it. But when it came to our first gig in Leeds the promoter was saying, 'What's your name?' We were like 'Oh, um... \"The Pigeon Detectives\".'\"\nWhen asked by BBC Sound about the name, Naylor said, \"Dave breeds pigeons, and there's a pigeon that lives in a shed, that's his special pigeon, and this pigeon actually writes all the songs\". Another story about the band's name was proposed when Matt Bowman and Ryan Wilson were interviewed for Later with Jools Holland; Bowman said that he and Wilson have a tradition of having Christmas dinner together and when they pulled a cracker they found the name inside. When asked about the rumour Bowman denied it and said, \"There's also a rumour that there's a giant pigeon at the bottom of our garden that writes all the lyrics, but that's equally as untrue.\"\nAccording to Bowman's Twitter, the band is in fact named after a 1970s French cartoon.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Wait for Me ===\nThe Pigeon Detectives are signed to the independent label Dance To The Radio with whom their first album, Wait for Me, was released on CD, 12\" heavyweight vinyl and digital download on 28 May 2007.

The album entered the UK Top 40 chart at number 3, achieving Gold status soon after release.\nOn 14 August 2007, the band appeared on the Jo Whiley show and performed their current single \"Take Her Back\" and a cover of Avril Lavigne's \"Girlfriend\" in the Live Lounge.\nIn July 2007, the band played at Oxegen, an Irish festival in County Kildare, and again in July 2008. In August 2007, the band played  Club NME supported by The Scare and The Stolen, followed by a September performance at Jersey Live, a weekend event held in Jersey, one of the Channel Islands, which included The Fratellis and Kasabian.\nIn September 2007 it was announced that the Pigeon Detectives had been nominated for Best New Act at the Q Awards, but they lost out to The Enemy.\nThe band supported Kaiser Chiefs on three of their November/December 2007 UK tour dates, including 1 December at the Manchester Evening News Arena and 15 December at Earls Court in London.\nA cover of the Huey Lewis and the News track \"The Power of Love\" appears on the Radio 1 Established 1967 compilation CD.\nThe band finished promoting Wait For Me and began promoting their second album, Emergency, in May 2008 with two consecutive gigs at Millennium Square in Leeds, playing to 15,000 fans over the two nights.\n\n\n=== Emergency ===\nIn January 2008, the Pigeon Detectives recorded their second album, titled Emergency, with producer Stephen Street in Monnow Valley Studios in Monmouth, Wales.

They had been demoing songs over the course of the year in between festival slots, the last of which was headlining the Underage Festival in London. They were also working on a new album.\nIn October 2009, the band recorded and released a cover of \"Tainted Love\" (made famous by fellow Leeds band Soft Cell), with all proceeds going to charity to help neglected children in Leeds.\nThe Pigeon Detectives toured as special guests with the Manchester band James in December 2010.\nThe band's third album, Up, Guards and at 'Em!, was recorded in Brooklyn, New York, with producer Justin Gerrish in the summer of 2010 and was released on 4 April 2011, with the lead single being \"Done in Secret\".

    "text": "Ex-Void, often stylised as Ex-Vöid, are a London-based indie rock band. It was formed by songwriters Lan McArdle and Owen Williams in 2018. The pair had both previously been in the band Joanna Gruesome. They have released one full-length album, one single, and one EP on independent labels.\n\n\n== History ==\nAs with Williams' other bands a humorous and fictional formation story was given to the music press. This time involving Williams and McArdle running into each other at a contemporary dance class, beginning to write songs during breaks there, and assembling a band out of other students. The band's name was influenced partly by The Raincoats' song 'The Void,' Black Sabbath's 'Into The Void,' and the punk band Void.\nOn 11 May 2018 the band released their self-titled debut EP on Don Giovanni Records. This had been preceded by the single \"Boyfriend\" on 8 May. That June they supported Waxahatchee on her tour of the UK.\nOn 25 March 2022 Ex-Void released their debut album Bigger Than Before on Don Giovanni Records in the US and Prefect Records in the UK. This was preceded by single \"Churchyard\" on 25 January.\nIn September 2024 the band released the single \"Swansea\", and announced their second album In Love Again would be released in January 2025 on Tapete Records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Only One\" - Prefect Records (2018)\n\"Swansea\" - Tapete Records (2024)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nEx-Vöid - Don Giovanni Records (2018)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nBigger Than Before - Prefect Records (UK) / Don Giovanni Records (USA) (2022)\nIn Love Again - Tapete Records (2025)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEx-Void discography at Discogs"

    "text": "The Lathums are an English indie rock band from Wigan, Greater Manchester. They are formed of singer/songwriter and guitarist Alex Moore, lead guitarist Scott Concepcion, bassist Matty Murphy and drummer Ryan Durrans, and are managed by Alfie Skelly. They were created by The Music Project, a stage school specialising in music, art, games and media, in April 2018 after their tutor placed them in the same project group, and within a year they signed with Island Records. They released their debut album, How Beautiful Life Can Be, on 24 September 2021. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart on 1 October 2021.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2018–2019: Formation ===\nAlex Moore, frontman of the band, first met Scott Concepcion before the band formed. The band began as a music project at college in Pemberton, Greater Manchester. The members consisted of drummer Ryan Durrans, bassist Lewis Halliwell, guitarist Scott Concepcion and singer Alex Moore. The band are named after a venue that they performed at. It's commonly pronounced as \"La-thums\", rather than \"Lay-thums\". When asked how it's pronounced, Moore stated, \"It's just how we pronounce it. It's just how it was christened.\" Halliwell later left the band, and brought on Johnny Cunliffe to replace him.\nIn 2018, the band wrote their first song together, \"Artificial Screens\", which they would self-release, along with other singles that would be re-released and remastered later down the line. In April 2019, the band released their first official single, \"Crying Out\". It was recorded by John Kettle and then later released as a single. Later on, the band released another single, \"The Great Escape\". This garnered the attention of Tim Burgess from the Charlatans. He invited the band to play a set at Kendal Calling.\n\n\n=== 2020–2021: COVID-19 and How Beautiful Life Can Be ===\nThe Lathums were signed to Island Records in March 2020. The band were set as support acts for Paul Weller and Blossoms, but they were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, the band released \"All My Life\" in July, an acoustic ballad, written by a 16-year-old Moore. It was produced by the Coral's James Skelly  at Liverpool's Parr Street Studio.\nIn September 2021, the band released their debut album, How Beautiful Life Can Be, which featured remastered versions of previously released singles, alongside new songs.\n\n\n=== 2022–present: Cunliffe's departure and From Nothing to a Little Bit More ===\n\nIn April 2022, the band released Sad Face Baby, the last single to feature Johnny Cunliffe on bass before his departure in 2022. The band brought on Matty Murphy as a replacement, but was not officially dubbed as a member until January 2023. During the time of Cunliffe's absence, the band were a support act for The Killers. Moore got the chance to do a cover of How Beautiful Life Can Be with them on stage, with Alex on acoustic guitar and Brandon Flowers on co-lead vocals.\nIn November 2022, the band announced their second album, From Nothing to a Little Bit More. Following the announcement, \"Say My Name\" and \"Turmoil\" were released.\nIn December 2022 \"Say My Name\" was named the Radio X Record of the Year.\nIn January 2023 they released the single \"Struggle.\" On February 16, they performed in Warrington ahead of the opening round of the Betfred Super League, Warrington Wolves vs Leeds Rhinos.\nIn June 2023 The Lathums made their debut on the Other Stage at Worthy Farm, Glastonbury Festival for a 45-minute set with the crowd getting bigger as each song was played.\nThe Lathums announced in December of 2023 that they would be playing a gig in the hometown, Wigan, accompanied by Jake Bugg, Brooke Combe and Alex Spencer on 19 July 2024. The gig was held at Robin Park Arena and alongside the band playing there, James Arthur, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds and Richard Ashcroft of The Verve would be playing there during the same week.

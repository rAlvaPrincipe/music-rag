Following further time in the studio, they released a six track EP in March 2010, building on their first three tracks with the songs \"Fuses\", \"Economics\" and \"Inland Empire\".\nBetween October 2009 and early 2010, Rapids! played a large number of shows across the south coast of England, gaining favourable reviews in Artrocker and Rocksound, as well as having airplay on John Kennedy's XFM show.

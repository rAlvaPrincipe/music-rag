    "text": "Nosferatu D2 were an English indie rock band from Croydon, Surrey, England. They were active from 2005 to 2007 and remained unsigned during that time. The band experienced posthumous acclaim and interest when the debuting Audio Antihero record label issued their unreleased debut album We're Gonna Walk Around This City With Our Headphones On To Block Out The Noise.\n\n\n== Pre-Nosferatu D2 years (1999–2004) ==\nBrothers, Ben (guitar/vocals) and Adam Parker (drums) originally made music together in a trio called Tempertwig. They performed live in London and released several demos and a 7\" split with Air Formation) which was aired on BBC Radio 1 by Steve Lamacq. The band split in 2004.\n\n\n== Active years (2005–2007) ==\nAfter the end of Tempertwig, Ben and Adam Parker formed Nosferatu D2 and began to play shows and demo new material, some of which was aired on XFM by John Kennedy and BBC Radio 1 by Huw Stephens. One of these demos received a praising review from James McMahon of NME and Art Brut member Chris Chinchilla.\nDuring the band's lifespan, they played a show with Air Formation and opened for Los Campesinos! and Sky Larkin at The Spitz. Afterwards, Los Campesinos! gave Nosferatu D2 a \"thanks to\" credit on their debut \"Hold on Now, Youngster...\" LP released through Wichita Records.\nIn 2007, Ben Parker began writing and recording under the Superman Revenge Squad name (taken from the comic book organisations of the same name) and Nosferatu D2 quietly disbanded.\n\n\n== Debut album/posthumous acclaim (2009) ==\nIn 2009, Nosferatu D2's unreleased We're Gonna Walk Around This City With Our Headphones On To Block Out The Noise album was issued by the newly-founded Audio Antihero record label, more than two years after they had separated.\nThis announcement was by praised by Gareth Campesinos! on the Los Campesinos! website and numerous Hype Machine sites.\nThe album itself was critically acclaimed. Drowned In Sound gave it 9/10 and called it \"some kind of alchemy, not to be repeated\"; The 405 awarded them 9/10 and suggested it could: \"one of those forgotten albums that will be hailed as influential come five or ten years\"; This Is Fake DIY graded it 8/10, The Music Fix described it as a \"lo-fi masterpiece\" with a 9/10 grading; Music Emissions graded it 10/10; The Organ stated \"I do like this, like it lots actually\", Scotland's The Skinny awarded it 4/5; and The Line Of Best Fit stated that \"your record collection is incomplete without its inclusion.\" Gareth Campesinos! again praised the album on Pitchfork in his best of 2009 picks.\nThe album was also well received by radio in the UK and internationally by radio with songs from the album given multiple airings on BBC 6 Music, Dandelion Radio, NME Radio, ResonanceFM, Florida's WVUM FM, Melbourne's Triple R FM, Kooba Radio, BSM Rocks!

Label-mate Benjamin Shaw would also cover their \"It's Christmas Time (For God's Sake)\".\n\"It's Christmas Time (For God's Sake)\" was also included in the Darren Hayman (Hefner/The French) and Fika Recordings 2011 Digital Advent Calendar, alongside fellow Audio Antihero artists including Jack Hayter, Fighting Kites, Paul Hawkins, Ian Button, Broken Shoulder and Benjamin Shaw.

    "text": "The Perfect Disaster were an English alternative rock band from Bedfordshire/Hertfordshire, England, formed in 1980.  They released four albums before splitting up in 1991. The only constant member was singer/guitarist Phil Parfitt.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first incarnation of the band was named Orange Disaster, with Parfitt joined by Ken Renny (bass), and Alison Pate (guitar). This line-up released a seven-inch EP called \"Something's Got To Give\" on Neuter Records, Catalogue Number OD 01. Often mislabeled as 1982 - the release date that is given on the labels is 1.9.1980 (1 September 1980). After this they changed their name to The Architects of Disaster. Parfitt and Pate were then joined by  Tony Pettitt (bass), Nod Wright (drums) and Paul Wright (guitar). This line-up disbanded, having released one single, \"Cucumber Sandwich\"/\"Friendly Fire.\" Nod Wright and Tony Pettit then left to form Fields of the Nephilim with Parfitt recruiting Grant Davidson (bass) and later John Saltwell (bass), Dan Cross (guitar), and Malcolm Catto (drums). They returned in 1984 as The Perfect Disaster, with an eponymous debut album issued on the French Kampa label in 1985. In 1987, the band signed to Glass Records, which reissued their debut album, and followed it with a twelve-inch EP later that year. There were further line-up changes when Saltwell and Pate departed, replaced by multi-instrumentalist Josephine Wiggs. The band moved on to Fire Records, releasing the Asylum Road album in 1988. Catto also left, with Phil Outram and Martin Langshaw joining for their third album, Up, which reached number fifteen on the UK Indie Chart, and saw the band touring with The Jesus and Mary Chain. In 1989, Wiggs left to join The Breeders, with Saltwell returning. In 1990, the band issued the Rise EP, and a final album, Heaven Scent, before splitting up the following year.\nParfitt went on to work with Spiritualized's Jason Pierce, and later formed a new band, Oedipussy, who released the album, Divan, in 1995, with contributions from former House of Love and Levitation guitarist Terry Bickers. In 2014, as Philip Parfitt, he released a solo album entitled I'm Not The Man I Use To Be on Milltone Head Recordings.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== The Perfect Disaster (1985) Kampa (France); reissued (1987) Glass ====\nTrack Listing (French version) \nSide One\n\"What Could I Do/Given The Opportunity/\" - (Philip Parfitt, Danny Cross, Allison Pate, John Saltwell, Malcolm Catto) -3:21\n\"Dawn In The Dark Woods\" - (Parfitt) - 3:07\n\"What's Happening To Me\" - (Parfitt, Cross, Pate, Saltwell, Catto) - 3:04\n\"Hiding From Frank\" - (Parfitt) - 2:20\n\"In The Pink\" - (Parfitt, Cross, Pate, Saltwell, Catto) - 4:35\nSide Two\n\t\"New Beginning\" - (Parfitt, Pate) - 3:39\n\"Teddy Edward\" - (Parfitt, Pate) - 2:51\n\"Keep Loves Feet On The Ground\" - (Parfitt) - 2:40\n\"Memories\" - (Parfitt, Pate) - 3:28\n\"Stetson\" - (Philip) - 3:22\nTrack Listing (Reissue) \nSide One\n\"What's Happening To Me?\" - (Philip Parfitt, Danny Cross, Allison Pate, John Saltwell, Malcolm Catto) - 3:04\n\"Dark Woods\" - (Parfitt) - 3:07\n\"What Could I Do?\" - (Parfitt, Cross, Pate, Saltwell, Catto) - 3:21\n\"Hiding From Frank\" - (Parfitt) - 2:20\n\"In The Pink\" - (Parfitt, Cross, Pate, Saltwell, Catto) - 4:35\nSide Two\n\t\"New Beginning\" - (Parfitt, Pate) - 3:39\n\"Teddy Edward\" - (Parfitt, Pate) - 2:51\n\"Keep Loves Feet On The Ground\" - (Parfitt) - 2:40\n\"Memories\" - (Parfitt, Pate) - 3:28\n\"Stetson\" - (Philip) - 3:22\n\"Over You\" - (Lou Reed) - 3:00\nPersonnel\nPhilip Parfitt - lead vocals, saxophone\nDanny Cross - lead guitar, pixiphone\nAlison Pate - rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nJohn Saltwell - bass, backing vocals\nMalcolm Catto - drums, organ\n\n\n==== Asylum Road (1988) Fire ====\nTrack Listing \nSide One\n\"The Crack Up\"\n\"Stop Crying Girl\"\n\"All The Stars\"\n\"Call It A Day\"\n\"In Conference Again\"\n\"Mooncraters\"\nSide Two\n \"T.V.

    "text": "The Domino State is an English alternative rock/indie band from London, England. The band have released two albums; Uneasy Lies The Crown in 2010 and Open Heart World in 2014. One of the band's guitarists (Tim Buckland) has been credited with teaching his younger brother, Jonny Buckland (of Coldplay) how to play guitar.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Domino State started out from a previous London based band called 'At The Lake' who released two singles on the Poptones label; \"These Days\" in 2005 and \"I Made My Excuses and Left\" in 2006. The group disbanded when their original bass player left and moved to Australia. The three remaining members of Matt Forder, James Machin and Tim Buckland formed a new band with Wil Padley and Rich Simic.\nThrough the familial connection of Jonny Buckland the band garnered attention with opening slots in front of 20,000 people at the 02 Arena on Coldplay's 2008 world tour. The band also supported M83, The Boxer Rebellion and Longview. The Domino State have also played at the Glastonbury Festival. The band released their first album, Uneasy Lies the Crown in 2010 on the Exhibition label.\nThey recruited a violinist, Carrie White and in December 2014 released their follow up album Open Heart World on a free/pay what you like download on the band's official website.\n\n\n== Reviews and press ==\nThe single \"Firefly\" has been described by Gordon Bruce of The Skinny as \"a slow-burning epic from start to finish that goes absolutely nowhere,\" whereas ClickMusic said that it was \"a rich zealous song, almost anthemic with its intense musical backdrop.\" Uneasy Lies the Crown has been noted as being \"a bold opening statement, it’s one of the best debuts to hit the streets\" in 2010. Paul Lockett of [sic] Magazine said of Open Heart World, \"on the evidence of this album, I’d certainly expect them to win lots of converts across the European festival circuit. Their sound is polished, layered, lush, ethereal even.\" Elsewhere, Echoes and Dust noted what was comforting \"is the fact that the band have not attempted to move away from that lovely, deep, sophisticated sound, where Matt Forder’s distinctive, velveteen vocal sits perfectly.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nUneasy Lies the Crown (16 August 2010)\nOpen Heart World (15 December 2014)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nEP01 (1 March 2008)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Iron Mask\" (1 October 2007)\n\"What's the Question\" (7 April 2008)\n\"Firefly\" (30 June 2009)\n\"We Must Not Shut Ourselves Away\" (12 July 2010)\n\"You are the Winter\" (7 March 2011)\n\"Your Love\" (20 April 2013)\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\"Firefly\" (30 June 2009)\n\"We Must Not Shut Ourselves Away\" (12 July 2010)\n\"You are the Winter\" (7 March 2011)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

The band's line-up consisted of vocalist Josh Franceschi, guitarists Max Helyer and Chris Miller, bassist Matt Barnes, and drummer Joe Phillips. The group released an EP, We Know What It Means to Be Alone in 2006, after which, Phillips left the band. He was replaced by Dan Flint, who the band had gone to college with, following the band's appearance at Slam Dunk Festival 2007. Flint was initially asked to fill in on drums for a tour, before being asked to join the band.\n\n\n=== Take Off Your Colours (2007–2008) ===\nThe band released another EP later in 2007. During summer 2007, the owner of Drive-Thru, Richard Reines, had arranged a meeting with the band. The band were ecstatic about the prospect and proceeded to wait in London for three hours, only for Reines to fail to show up.\nTheir debut album, Take Off Your Colours, came out in October 2008 on Slam Dunk Records. Six singles were released from the album: \"Save It for the Bedroom\", \"If I Were in Your Shoes\", \"Gossip\", \"Jealous Minds Think Alike\", \"Finders Keepers\" and \"Kiss and Tell\". Take off Your Colours was re-released as a \"deluxe\" version, with added tracks, and the band supported Fall Out Boy in late 2008. They were nominated for \"Best British Band\" at the 2008 and 2009 Kerrang! Awards, but lost both times to Bullet for My Valentine.\n\n\n=== Hold Me Down (2009–2010) ===\nThe band released second album, Hold Me Down, on Virgin Records in January 2010.

They have completed their third sell-out headline tour in support of their second album Hold Me Down. They were joined by Sean Smith and Elissa Franceschi on selected dates.

A further single,  \"No One Does It Better\", was released in 2012, as was a song specially recorded for The Swarm, a ride at Thorpe Park. On 16 April 2011, Blink-182 announced that their headlining tour would be delayed till 2012 due to the fact that they have not finished recording for the new album yet. As a result, You Me at Six will not be touring with them.

On 1 September 2011, a 30-second snippet of the track from the record \"Bite My Tongue\" featuring Oli Sykes was leaked on the internet as well. It was removed 30 minutes later due to infringement and copyrighted issues. The band's next UK tours started in March 2012.

Following on from these mixed reviews for Night People, You Me at Six released their sixth album, VI, on 5 October 2018 to much more positive reviews. The album debuted and peaked at number six on the UK album charts.\nFollowing the 2019–20 Australian Bushfires, You Me at Six released a charity single Our House (The Mess We Made), raising money for the WIRES foundation.

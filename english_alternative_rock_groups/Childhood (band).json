    "text": "Childhood were an English rock band, formed in 2010 in Nottingham by South Londoners Ben Romans-Hopcraft and Leo Dobsen while studying at the University of Nottingham.\nThe duo first gained attention after uploading a couple of demos online. After recruiting bassist Daniel Salamons and drummer Daniel Ajegbo, the band gigged around Nottingham before signing to Marathon Artists / House Anxiety and released their debut single Blue Velvet in October 2012. Following the departure of Daniel Ajegbo and re-basing themselves in South London, the band recruited Jonny Williams and released second single Solemn Skies on 10 June 2013. The single was produced by Rory Attwell, formerly of Test Icicles.\nThe band released their debut album Lacuna on 11 August 2014. Produced by Dan Carey, the album was preceded by the single Falls Away in June.\nOn 24 April 2015, the band revealed that Thomas Fiquet was now the band's bass player - despite updating the band's lineup information on their Facebook page, the band never announced or commented on the departure of Daniel Salamons.\nOn 21 July 2017, the band released their second album Universal High. The album was preceded by single 'Californian Light' in April 2017 and second single \"Cameo\" in June 2017. Recorded the previous summer in Atlanta, USA at Maze Studios with Ben H Allen III, the album was less collaborative than their debut, with Romans-Hopcraft admitting that although he \"would never call it a solo project\" that \"for this record, we all tried to collaborate and it never really worked, so it ended up coming from this one funnel – then everyone added their own thing\".\nThe band quietly disbanded in 2018, with Romans-Hopcraft going on to play bass with Insecure Men and Warmduscher. He is also currently working on a new project with Sean Lennon producing.\nOriginal bassist Daniel Salamons continues to work as a session player. The band's second bassist Thomas Fiquet has gone on to join Swim Deep.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n== Former Members ==\nBen Romans-Hopcraft – lead vocals, guitar (2010–2018)\nLeo Dobsen – guitar (2010–2018)\nThomas \"Tomaski\" Fiquet – bass guitar (2015–2018)\nMax Danieli-Fantin – keyboard, synthesizer, backing vocals (2014–2018)\nJonny Williams – drums (2013–2018)\nDaniel Ajegbo – drums (2010–2012)\nChris O'Driscoll – drums (2012–2013)\nDaniel Salamons – bass guitar (2011–2015)\n\n\n== References =="

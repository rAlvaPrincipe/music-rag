    "text": "Wunderhorse are an English rock band formed in 2020 by frontman and songwriter Jacob Slater. Initially a solo project, Wunderhorse became a full band in 2021, with Slater (vocals, guitar) being joined by Harry Tristan Fowler (guitar), Peter Woodin (bass) and Jamie Staples (drums). They have released two albums and toured internationally.\n\n\n== History ==\nJacob Slater left home at age 17 and lived in London for five years. He was previously the frontman of punk trio Dead Pretties before the group's disbandment in 2017. After the Dead Pretties broke up, Slater moved to Newquay, Cornwall, where he found odd jobs as a labourer and worked as a surfing instructor while continuing to write music. During this time Slater also landed an acting role, playing drummer Paul Cook in Pistol, a six-part miniseries about the Sex Pistols directed by Danny Boyle. Slater has cited Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and Elliott Smith as musical influences.\nSlater began Wunderhorse as a solo project during the COVID-19 pandemic. Asked about the band's name, Slater told Hero: \"There's this old TV show from the 50s or 60s called Champion the Wonder Horse... I started using the name as a joke and it was one of those things that stuck\". He later joined with drummer Jamie Staples, guitarist Harry Fowler (who is also the son of pop singer Kim Wilde), and bassist Pete Woodin to form the current band. Guitarist Oscar Browne recorded with the band but later left the group.\nWunderhorse's debut album Cub was released 7 October 2022 by Communion Music, It was written solely by Slater and produced by Kevin Jones and Peter Woodin.\nCub was named one of the best albums of 2022 by NME, Riot, and Far Out. Critics described the album as \"a warming blues/garage/indie fire... an album best enjoyed in its entirety and at high volume\", \"some of the most well-crafted and interesting rock songs of this decade\", \"a brilliant catalogue of teenage life - ill-fated love, drugs, self-destruction, depression as well as youthful joy - all to a rousing soundtrack that harks back to the 1990s\", and \"melodic reflection from a man growing into himself\".\nIn 2022, Wunderhorse toured as a supporting act for other bands, opening for Irish punk band Fontaines D.C., Pixies, Foals, and fellow UK singer-songwriters Sam Fender and Declan McKenna. In spring 2023, Wunderhorse toured the United States, with concert dates in several cities and played at Glastonbury Festival 2023 during the summer.\nWunderhorse released their second album, Midas, on 30 August 2024. It was produced by former Rolling Stones producer Craig Silvey and was preceded by the release of five singles: the title track \"Midas\", \"Silver\", \"July\", \"Rain\", and \"Arizona\". The album received critical acclaim from multiple publications, and charted at number 6 the following week on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nCub (2022)\nMidas (2024)\n\n\n== References =="

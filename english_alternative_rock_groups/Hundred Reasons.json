    "text": "Hundred Reasons are an English alternative rock band formed in London, England, in 1999. It consists of Colin Doran (vocals), Larry Hibbitt (guitar, vocals), Andy Gilmour (bass), and Andy Bews (drums).\nAfter releasing EpOne, EpTwo, and  EpThree between 2000 and 2001, Hundred Reasons issued their debut full-length album, Ideas Above Our Station, in 2002, to critical acclaim and commercial success. The album yielded the singles \"I'll Find You\", \"If I Could\", \"Silver\", and \"Falter\", and was followed by Shatterproof Is Not a Challenge in 2004. After being dropped by Columbia Records, the band signed with V2 Records and released their third studio album, Kill Your Own, in 2006. Guitarist and vocalist Paul Townsend departed following the release and was replaced by Ben Doyle for the band's fourth album, Quick the Word, Sharp the Action (2007).\nFollowing years of inactivity, Hundred Reasons played tenth-anniversary shows in 2012 and briefly reunited again for two shows in 2014. After regrouping in 2021, they issued their fifth album, Glorious Sunset, in 2023.\nHundred Reasons have had six top-40 hit singles and two top-20 hit albums.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Formation and first releases: 1999–2004 ===\nHundred Reasons was formed in London, England, in 1999. By 2001, they had released three EPs: EpOne, EpTwo, and  EpThree, as well as a split EP with the American punk rock band Garrison.\nThe band's debut album, Ideas Above Our Station, was released in 2002. It peaked at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart, achieved Gold status, with sales of over 118,000 copies, and spawned several Top 40 hits on the UK Singles Chart.\nTheir second album, Shatterproof Is Not A Challenge, was released in 2004. Despite successful tours and achieving Silver status with sales of more than 65,000 copies within four months, Hundred Reasons were dropped by Sony BMG in June 2004.\n\n\n=== Subsequent releases and lineup change (2005–2009) ===\nHundred Reasons signed to V2 Records in September 2005 and issued their third studio album, Kill Your Own, in 2006. In August of that year, it was announced on the band's official website that guitarist and vocalist Paul Townsend would be leaving the band. He was replaced by Ben Doyle of the Lucky Nine.\nIn October 2007, the band published their fourth album, Quick the Word, Sharp the Action. Less than a month later, V2 Records was purchased by Universal Records and left the band without a label once more. They re-released a remastered version of Quick the Word, Sharp the Action in 2009.\n\n\n=== Hiatus and reunion shows (2009–2014) ===\nAfter the re-release of Quick the Word, Sharp the Action, Hundred Reasons went on an extended hiatus. Reflecting on this period in an interview with NME in 2022, Doran stated: \"After Quick the Word, personally for me that felt like it was going to be it. I'm quite pragmatic and I think it had some good songs on it, but it wasn't what I would call our best record. Things were on a bit of a downward turn, to be open and frank about it. We just ended up, not necessarily dissolving the band but everybody had to go and find other things to do. Those things took over, then weeks turned into months, which turned into years. Larry was building his career as a producer, I was in education and doing stuff like that, Bews was living in America which made rehearsal quite different, and Andy was in another band at the time called Freeze Atlantic.\"\nIn April 2012, the band announced that they would be performing songs from their first album, Ideas Above Our Station, at both Banquet Records' Big Day Out and 2000Trees, and that they had been rejoined by Paul Townsend. Hell Is for Heroes drummer Joe Birch performed with them that summer.\"\nOn 8 May, it was revealed that Townsend would not be performing with the band after all.\nIn 2014, Hundred Reasons reunited once more to play the Sonisphere Festival.\n\n\n=== Glorious Sunset (2022–present) ===\nOn 25 October 2022, the band announced that they would be releasing their first new music in fifteen years, with a single called \"Glorious Sunset\". A full-length album, also titled Glorious Sunset, came out on 24 February 2023.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent\n\nColin Doran – lead vocals, keyboards (1999–2012; 2014; 2021–present)\nLarry Hibbitt – guitar, occasional lead vocals (1999–2012; 2014; 2021–present)\nAndy Gilmour – bass, backing vocals (1999–2012; 2014; 2021–present)\nAndy Bews – drums (1999–2009; 2012; 2021–present)\nPast\n\nPaul Townsend – guitar, occasional lead vocals (1999–2006, 2012)\nBen Doyle – guitar (2006–2009)\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n2007 interview with Larry Hibbitt\n2009 interview with Hundred Reasons"

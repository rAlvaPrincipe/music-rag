    "text": "The Brilliant Corners were a British indie pop band from Bristol who recorded throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was formed in 1983, taking the name from the  Thelonious Monk jazz album, Brilliant Corners. The line-up included Davey Woodward (b. Avonmouth, Bristol, England; vocals, guitar), Chris Galvin (1959 – 22 December 1998; bass guitar), Winston Forbes (lead guitar, percussion, backing vocals), Bob Morris (drums) and Dan Pacini (occasional trumpet and keyboards). A later addition was Phil Elvins on guitar.\nThe band's first releases were early examples of indie pop, with three singles being released in 1984 on their own SS20 label. Their first (mini-)album, Growing Up Absurd, appeared the following year. With an explosion of indie pop groups in 1986, their May release Fruit Machine EP gained them both attention and radio airplay, followed by a second mini-album, What's In A Word. \"Brian Rix\", a re-recorded version of a track from the LP, with added trumpet, and a tribute to Rix, the \"king of farce\", was issued as a single, the proceeds going to Mencap, the charity of which Rix was chairman. The video, featuring Woodward running Rix-like around a couch with his trousers around his ankles, was shown on The Tube, further raising the band's profile.\nIn March 1988, the band set up another label, McQueen, and released third album, Somebody Up There Likes Me, followed by a collection of their sought-after early singles, Everything I Ever Wanted. Two more albums followed in 1989 (Joy Ride) and 1990 (Hooked), followed by a second compilation, Creamy Stuff, in 1991. They released A History Of White Trash in 1993 before splitting up.\nWoodward and Galvin formed the Experimental Pop Band in 1995. Galvin died from cancer in 1998.\nThe Brilliant Corners reformed in 2013 for a short tour.\nWinston Forbes died in 2019.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nDavey Woodward (vocals, guitar)\nWinston Forbes (guitar)\nChris Galvin (bass)\nBob Morris (drums)\nDan Pacini (trumpet, keyboards)\nPhil Elvins (guitar)\nPaul Sandrone (guitar)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nChart placings shown are from the UK Indie Chart.\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"She's Got Fever\" (1984, SS20) (No. 1)\n\"Big Hip\" (1984, SS20) (No. 16)\n\"My Baby's In Black\" (1984, SS20) (No. 14)\n\"Brian Rix\" (1987, SS20) (No. 11)\n\"Delilah Sands\" (1987, SS20) (No. 9)\n\"Teenage\" (2006, McQueen) (No. 9)\n\"Why Do You Have To Go Out With Him When You Could Go Out With Me?\" (1988, McQueen) (No. 10)\n\"I Love It, I Lost It\" (1990, McQueen)\n\"The Pope, The Monkey and The Queen\" (1990, McQueen)\n\n\n=== EPs and mini-albums ===\nGrowing Up Absurd mini-album (1985, SS20) (No. 26)\nThe Fruit Machine EP (1986, SS20)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nWhat's In A Word (1986, SS20) (No. 8)\nSomebody Up There Likes Me (2006, McQueen) (No. 6)\nJoy Ride (1989, McQueen) (No. 6)\nHooked (1990, McQueen)\nA History Of White Trash (1993, C.M.P.)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nEverything I Ever Wanted (1988, McQueen) (compilation) (No. 17)\nCreamy Stuff (1991, McQueen)\nHeart on Your Sleeve: A Decade in Pop 1983–1993 (2013, Cherry Red)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Bands from Bristol\nCulture of Bristol\nList of Record Labels from Bristol\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUnofficial fansite with photos, videos & more"

    "text": "itoldyouiwouldeatyou is a UK based indie-punk band.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2019, they compiled features with Master Peace, TeenSlasher91 & Worstworldproblem. These collaborations contributed to their creation of K.O.#1. The band started when lead singer, Joey Ashworth, decided they wanted to start a musical group that represented people they wanted to be like at college. Ashworth chose the name because they \"thought it was funny to make ambient music but make it sound like a powerviolence band.\"\nTheir composition has fluctuated in recent years. \nTheir debut album was \"Oh Dearism\".\nAshworth sings on every song on the album. The album was released with Alcopop! Records and Failure By Design. The Alternative gave them a \"Good\" album review in November 2018.  By 2020, it had already racked up hundreds of thousands of plays on streaming platforms.\nThey have appeared in the Handmade Festival in 2019 and hosted a special showcase at the Great Escape.\n\n\n== References =="

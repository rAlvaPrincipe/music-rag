    "text": "The Pineapple Thief are an English progressive rock band founded in 1999 by Bruce Soord in Yeovil, Somerset. As of June 2024, the group consists of Soord on vocals, guitars, and keyboards, Jon Sykes on bass, Steve Kitch on keyboards, and Gavin Harrison on drums. They have released 16 studio albums, 6 EPs, and several live and compilation albums.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nBruce Soord started the musical project Pineapple Thief (named after a dialogue in the movie Eve's Bayou) as an outlet for his music in 1999. The project's debut album, Abducting the Unicorn, was released by Cyclops Records in 1999 and followed in 2002 by 137.\nIn 2003, Soord released Variations on a Dream and subsequently decided to form a band, adding \"The\" to its name, to differentiate its initials PT from Porcupine Tree, another English progressive rock band. Its first lineup consisted of Soord on vocals, Jon Sykes on bass, Wayne Higgins on guitar, Matt O'Leary on keyboards, and Keith Harrison on drums. As a full band, they released 12 Stories Down in 2004, re-recorded and remixed as 10 Stories Down a year later. O'Leary subsequently left the band, and Steve Kitch, who co-produced and mixed 10 Stories Down, joined on keyboards.\nFollowing the release of Little Man in 2006, the band published What We Have Sown in late 2007 as a final Cyclops release before being signed to Kscope, a division of Snapper Music. In 2007, the Pineapple Thief's music featured in the third season of the MTV reality series The Hills; the song \"Snowdrops\" can be heard in episode 28.\nWayne Higgins left the band in March 2008.\n\n\n=== Kscope years ===\n\nIn May 2008, the Pineapple Thief helped relaunch the Kscope label with their seventh studio album, Tightly Unwound. They also released a mini-documentary film on their website, featuring interviews and two exclusive live tracks.\nThis was followed in 2009 by the EPs The Dawn Raids Volume 1 and The Dawn Raids Volume 2 as well as the box set 3000 Days, a 2-CD remixed and remastered collection of songs from their ten-year history to date.\nThe band's next release, Someone Here Is Missing, came out in 2010. The album features artwork by Storm Thorgerson. It was followed by the download-only album Someone Here Is Live later that year.\nThe band entered the studio in 2012 to record their ninth full-length record, which included a 22-piece orchestra and choir.\nOn 8 February 2014, the band announced that Dan Osborne had replaced Keith Harrison on drums.\nThe Pineapple Thief's tenth studio album, Magnolia, was released on 15 September 2014.\nIn August 2016, they issued Your Wilderness, the first record to feature drummer Gavin Harrison (Porcupine Tree, King Crimson).\nIn August 2018, the Pineapple Thief released their twelfth studio album, Dissolution.\nOn 4 September 2020, their thirteenth studio album, Versions of the Truth, came out.\nOn 9 February 2024, the band issued their latest record, It Leads to This.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nCurrent\n\nBruce Soord – vocals, guitars, keyboards (2002–present); bass, drums (1999–2002)\nJon Sykes – bass guitar, vocals (2002–present)\nSteve Kitch – keyboards (2005–present)\nGavin Harrison – drums (2017–present)\nPast\n\nKeith Harrison – drums, vocals (2002–2013)\nWayne Higgins – guitars, vocals (2002–2008)\nMatt O'Leary – keyboards (2002–2005)\nDan Osborne – drums, vocals (2013–2016)\nSession/live\n\nDarran Charles – guitars, vocals (2014–2017)\nGavin Harrison – drums (2016)\nGeorge Marios – guitar, vocals (2018–2021)\nBeren Matthews – guitar, vocals (2021–present)\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nAbducting the Unicorn (1999) – re-released in 2017 as Abducted at Birth, remastered with one bonus track\n137 (2002)\nVariations on a Dream (2003)\n10 Stories Down (2005) – initially released as 12 Stories Down in 2004\nLittle Man (2006)\nWhat We Have Sown (2007)\nTightly Unwound (2008)\nSomeone Here Is Missing (2010)\nAll the Wars (2012)\nMagnolia (2014)\nYour Wilderness (2016)\n8 Years Later (2016)\nDissolution (2018)\nVersions of the Truth (2020)\nGive It Back (2022)\nIt Leads to This (2024)\nLive and video albums\n\nLive (2003) – DVD/CD + 4 new studio tracks\nLive at the Half Moon, Putney (2008) – video\nSomeone Here Is Live (2010) – download only, recorded October 2010\nLive at the 013 (2013) – download only, recorded November 2012\nLive 2014 (2014) – download only, recorded November 2014\nWhere We Stood (2017) – DVD/CD, recorded February 2017\nHold Our Fire (2019) – CD, recorded September 2018\nNothing But the Truth (2021) – DVD/CD, live studio recording\nCompilations and box sets\n\n3000 Days (2009)\nIntroducing the Pineapple Thief (2013)\nHow Did We Find Our Way (1999 – 2006) (2023)\nEPs\n\n4 Stories Down (2005)\nThe Dawn Raids Volume 1 (2009)\nThe Dawn Raids Volume 2 (2009)\nShow a Little Love (2010)\nBuild a World (2013)\nUncovering Your Tracks (2020) – re-recorded songs\nSingles\n\n\"Sherbert Gods\" (2001) – 7\" single\n\"Shoot First'\" (2008) – download-only single\n\"Nothing at Best\" (2010) – download-only single\nMusic videos\n\n\"Shoot First\" (2008)\n\"Nothing at Best\" (2010)\n\"Show a Little Love\" (2010)\n\"Someone Here Is Missing\" (2010)\n\"All the Wars\" (2012)\n\"Someone Pull Me Out of Here\" (2012)\n\"Build a World\" (2013)\n\"Simple as That\" (2014)\n\"A Sense of Fear\" (2014)\n\"In Exile\" (2016)\n\"Try as I Might\" (2018)\n\"Demons\" (2020)\n\"Break It All\" (2020)\n\"Versions of the Truth\" (2020)\n\"Driving Like Maniacs\" (2020)\n\"The Frost\" (2023)\n\"It Leads to This\" (2024)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nBruce Soord official website"

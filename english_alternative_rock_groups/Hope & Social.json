    "text": "Hope & Social (stylised as Hope&Social) are a six-piece (plus) rock band based in Leeds, England. Formed in 2008, they have released 3 albums in under three years and have toured extensively. Hope and Social are characterised by their \"Pay What You Want\" approach to their music.\nIn July 2008, Hope & Social released their first EP with a full-length album to follow. On 7 October 2008, the band appeared on Channel M, a TV station based in Manchester. On 3 June 2009, the band released their new album, Architect of this Church. The album was in the making for 2 years and took over 16000 man hours to record. It was made available to purchase on their website, for however much the purchaser thinks it is worth.\nIn 2009, the band performed twice at Glastonbury as finalists in Glastonbury's Emerging Talent Competition. In April 2010, Hope and Social released April, their second full-length album and the first to feature fully the new line-up of the band. In May 2011, Hope and Social's third studio album Sleep Sound was released and immediately rose to No.1 on bandcamp.com.\nIn March 2012, the band released an album Cotton Wool & Knotted Wood, recorded live, and their fourth studio album All Our Dancing Days was released on 13 November 2012. The band kicked off the opening ceremony for the 2014 Tour de France at Leeds Arena, performing with The Band Anyone Can Join, consisting of 100 local people.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members:\n\nSimon Wainwright – Vocals, Guitar and Piano\nRich Huxley – Guitar, Cello, Banjo and Vocals, Glockenspiel, Piano\nEd Waring – Rhodes, Organ\nGary Stewart - Drums, Vocals, Piano, Backing Vocals\nJames Hamilton - Brass, Piano, Glockenspiel, Backing Vocals\nSimon Fletcher - Bass, Sousaphone, Backing Vocals\nPast members:\n\nSimon Goff – Bass and Strings\n\n\n=== Four Day Hombre ===\n13 March 2006 saw the nationwide release of their debut album, Experiments in Living, as Four Day Hombre and through their own record label, Alamo Music.\nThe publicity activities accompanying the release of this album, along with the unusual history of Alamo Music, raised the profile of the band considerably during 2006. On 7 February 2006 they played a half-hour session on the Janice Long show on BBC Radio 2, which featured a number of live acoustic performances as well as a discussion with the band. The album release was followed by a tour of Barfly venues around Britain.\nIn the autumn of 2006 they toured the UK supporting Embrace and released the mini-album Fight Death. A tour of Canada was completed in March 2007, to support the release of Experiments in Living in that country. The tour included support slots for Canadian bands The Marble Index and The Miniatures.\nOn 15 May 2008, it was announced by the band that they were changing their name to Hope & Social, stating \"same line-up, but with a different approach and sound\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSelf-recorded demo, 2000.

They hence became shareholders in Alamo. This 'fan-funded' approach has produced significant publicity for the band in national and regional press. For example, an article concerning the label and its formation was featured on the front page of the BBC website on 13 March 2006, the day of release of Experiments in Living.\nThe name Alamo was chosen in reference to the Battle of the Alamo. A quote from William Barret Travis, commander of the Texan forces at this battle, is printed on the inside of Experiments in Living: \"I shall have to fight the enemy on his own terms.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nOfficial blog\n\"Fans splash cash for hot new band\" - BBC News, 13 March 2006\nInterview with Four Day Hombre UKEvents.net\nInterview with Hope & Social Record Overplayed"

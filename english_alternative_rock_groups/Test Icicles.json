    "text": "Test Icicles were a short-lived rock band that formed in England in 2004, primarily influenced by post-hardcore, dance-punk and indie rock but containing musical elements from a variety of genres (notably dance, hip hop, crossover thrash, and punk). The band was formed by Rory Attwell and Sam Mehran, who were later joined by Dev Hynes. Hynes and Mehran were both 18 years old at the time of the band's inception. The group has since become notable due to the later success of its members.\n\n\n== History ==\nPrior to forming the band, Atwell, Hynes and Mehran (all of whom shared vocal and guitar duties) had met each other through mutual friends. The trio's preference for the same nightspots (such as the Afterskool night club, in London) also led to frequent meet-ups. Initially the band formed under the moniker Balls with Ferry Gouw, who shortly after went on to form Semifinalists, effectively in the role Hynes eventually filled. Gouw left the band for an extended trip to Indonesia, at which time Attwell and Mehran recruited Hynes and changed the band name to Test Icicles, the new band name also being a suggestion from Gouw.\nAll three members of the group were involved in numerous, short-lived musical projects before the forming of Test Icicles.\n\n\n== Split ==\nIn February 2006, the band announced they were splitting up.\nOn 26 April 2006 the band released Dig Your Own Grave, an EP meant as a farewell from the band. It featured a CD with remixes and unreleased tracks, and a DVD with the band's music videos.\n\n\n== Post-Test Icicles ==\nAfter the band split, the individual members continued to stay active, becoming involved in a number of side projects between them.\nMehran was believed to have moved back to America after the split and claimed to have been spotted working in a record store in New York. \nIn July 2018, Mehran was found dead in his Hollywood home due to suicide, just after completing work on a planned solo album. Hynes paid tribute to him on Instagram, saying, “Every time I was with you we were 17 again. You were such a gift to this world. The floor has gone and I don’t know where to stand. RIP.”\n\n\n== Members ==\nRory Attwell (aka Raary Deci-hells, Raary Rambert RAT ATT AGG, Rory Brattwell) English (born in London, England)  — guitar and vocals\nSam Mehran (aka Sam E Danger, Sam E Slaughter) American (born in Miami, moved to Adelaide, Australia, then to New York City before moving to England) — vocals and guitar (died July 2018)\nDevonté Hynes (aka Dev Metal, !Ved) English (born in London, England) — guitar, keyboards and vocals\n\n\n=== Touring members ===\nAdam Bainbridge (aka DJ Jitset) English (Born in Peterborough, England) — DJ\n\n\n== Equipment ==\nRory Attwell (Guitars - Wilson Bros.

    "text": "Tram was a British musical duo composed of Paul Anderson and Nick Avery. Part of the slowcore movement, Tram was recognized for lush instrumentation played at a very slow pace. Tram recorded three albums, all of which were well received by the music press.\nTheir first album, Heavy Black Frame, was produced by multi-instrumentalist Clive Painter, and features him and his partner in Broken Dog, Martine Roberts, alongside Placebo (band) keyboardist Bill Lloyd. Heavy Black Frame was released on the Piao! label in the UK, and Jetset Records in USA. The subsequent UK albums appeared on Setanta Records. In January 2009 Paul Anderson and Clive Painter formed a new band called the 99 Call, and performed their first show in Rimini, Italy in July 2009. The performance was in part a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the release of Heavy Black Frame.\n\n\n== Members ==\nPaul Anderson\nNick Avery\nCollaborators\nIda Akesson (piano, keyboards)\nFiona Brice (violin, piano)\nJohn Frennet (bass)\nBill Lloyd (piano)\nHannah Marshall (cello)\nClive Painter (production, guitar, bass, harmonium, piano, clarinet, percussion)\nIan Painter (bass)\nJohn Parish (production, slide guitar)\nMartine Roberts (production, bass, vocals)\nIan Watson (trumpet)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nNothing Left To Say (7\" single) Piao!

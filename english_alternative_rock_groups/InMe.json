They have released seven studio albums, two EPs, one bootleg album, one best-of compilation, one live album, one live EP and an acoustic album. A DVD of the band's Overgrown Eden show at the Highbury Garage in November 2010 was released via PledgeMusic as a part of the band's campaign for their fifth album The Pride. The band has had eight singles appear on the UK Top 100 Singles Chart. The band are open about the fact that they all have day jobs, and ask fans to support them financially.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation (1996–2000) ===\nThe group originally formed as Drowned in 1996 when many of the band were just 14 years old. The members of the band at that time were Dave McPherson as guitarist / vocalist, Joe Morgan as bassist / backing vocalist and Simon Taylor as drummer. They played several local venues, getting their first interviews and airplay on Brentwood-based radio station, Phoenix FM. They recorded many unreleased tracks such as \"acid drop\" and \"apricot\"  The band scored their break when a scout from MFN caught the end of one of their sets, whilst attending a gig to see another band called -ism. They signed with MFN in 2001, and changed their name to InMe to avoid confusion with Drowned, an American Christian rock band of the same name.\n\n\n=== Overgrown Eden (2001–2003) ===\nOvergrown Eden was released through Music for Nations in January 2003, after numerous delays.

    "text": "Spear of Destiny is a British rock band, formed in London in 1982 by lead vocalist, guitarist and principal songwriter Kirk Brandon and bassist Stan Stammers. It has had an ever-changing line-up through the years.\nIt has had 10 UK Singles Chart entries. Four reached the Top 50 but only one made the Top 20 – \"Never Take Me Alive\" (1987).\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed in 1982, the band's original line-up consisted of Kirk Brandon, Stan Stammers, Chris Bell and Lascelles James. In late 1983, this line-up was superseded by Dolphin Taylor on drums, Alan St. Clair on guitar, John Lennard on saxophone and Neil Pyzer on keyboards and additional saxophone. In 1984, John Lennard was replaced by Mickey Donnelly on saxophone.\nSpear of Destiny recorded one session for John Peel (recorded 22 November 1982, transmitted on BBC Radio 1 on 29 November 1982).\n\"The band played a punk-influenced form of power rock, which often had an anthemic feel.\"\nTheir second studio album, One Eyed Jacks was released in 1984. It reached No. 22 in the UK Albums Chart Spear of Destiny’s reputation in the mid-1980s depended to a greater extent on their live performances.\nIn 1985, their third studio album, World Service reached the UK Top 20.\nOn 22 June 1985 they were one of five bands supporting U2 at the Longest Day concert at the Milton Keynes Bowl. The other acts were the Faith Brothers, Billy Bragg, the Ramones and R.E.M.\nFounding member Stan Stammers left the band in 1986. In the wake of the release of the fourth studio album, Outland (1987) and its Top 15 hit \"Never Take Me Alive\", the band began achieving some chart success and staging sell-out concerts, including a support slot to U2 at Wembley Stadium. However, ill fortune struck on the eve of the band's appearance at the Reading Festival, as Brandon developed reactive arthritis which obliged the band to put all their plans on hold for nearly a year.\nIn addition to Brandon and Stammers, past members of the band in the 1980s included former Gillan drummer Pete Barnacle, former JoBoxers bassist Chris Bostock, former Adam and the Ants guitarist Marco Pirroni, former Tom Robinson Band and Stiff Little Fingers drummer Dolphin Taylor, and in the 1990s included guitarist Mark Gemini Thwaite of The Mission.\nBrandon was also a member of the supergroup Dead Men Walking.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nGrapes of Wrath (1983) – UK No. 62\nOne Eyed Jacks (1984) – UK No. 22\nWorld Service (1985) – UK No. 11\nOutland (1987) – UK No. 16\nThe Price You Pay (1988) – UK No. 37\nSod's Law (1991)\nReligion (1997)\nVolunteers (2000)\nMorning Star (2003)\nLoadestone (2005)\nImperial Prototype (2007)\nOmega Point (2010)\n31 (2014)\nTontine (2018)\nGhost Population (2022)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of post-punk bands\nTheatre of Hate\nKirk Brandon's 10:51\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpear of Destiny at AllMusic\nSpear of Destiny discography at Discogs \nSpear of Destiny at IMDb\nKirkbrandon.com (official website)\nStanstammers.com (official website)[usurped]\nThe Engine Room (the Spear of Destiny rhythm section)[usurped]"

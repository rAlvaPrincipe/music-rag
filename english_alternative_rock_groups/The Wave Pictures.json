    "text": "The Wave Pictures are an English rock band consisting of David Tattersall (vocals and guitar), Franic Rozycki (bass guitar) and Jonny Helm (drums).\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe band has its origins in a group called Blind Summit, which David and Franic formed with Hugh Noble in Wymeswold, near Loughborough in Leicestershire, in 1998. The band changed its name to the Wave Pictures and Hugh was eventually permanently replaced by Jonny Helm. They recorded and self-released a string of albums before settling in London.\nThe Guardian has described their work as \"charming, witty pop songs shot through with Jonathan Richman's gawky glee and Suede's doomed provincial romanticism... They owe a certain debt to The Smiths, and Tattersall has Morrissey's knack of marrying the ridiculous and the sublime\".\nThe band is closely linked to artists Darren Hayman (formerly of Hefner), Herman Dune, Daniel Johnston, Jeffrey Lewis and the Mountain Goats, all of whom they have collaborated with live and on record.\nIn 2014, Billy Childish produced, played on and co-wrote (with Dave Tattersall) most of the songs on Great Big Flamingo Burning Moon.\nTheir 2016 album, A Season in Hull, was recorded live using a single microphone and released on vinyl only.\nTattersall and Rozycki also began a side project, The Surfing Magazines, with Slow Club member Charles Watson, releasing an album in 2017. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nJust Watch Your Friends Don't Get You (2003)\nMore Street, Less TV (2003)\nThe Airplanes at Brescia (2004)\nThe Hawaiian Open Mic Night (2005)\nCatching Light: the Songs of André Herman Düne (2006)\nSophie (2006)\nInstant Coffee Baby (2008)\nIf You Leave It Alone (2009)\nSusan Rode the Cyclone (2010)\nBeer in the Breakers (2011)\nLong Black Cars (2012)\nThe Songs of Jason Molina (2013)\nCity Forgiveness (2013)\nGreat Big Flamingo Burning Moon (2015)\nA Season in Hull (2016)\nBamboo Diner in the Rain (2016)\nBrushes with Happiness (2018)\nLook Inside Your Heart (2018)\nWhen the Purple Emperor Spreads His Wings (2022)\n\n\n=== Singles/EPs ===\nWe Dress Up Like Snowmen/Now You Are Pregnant (2007)\nI Love You Like a Madman (2008)\nStrange Fruit for David (2008)\nJust Like a Drummer (2008)\nPigeon EP (2008)\nIf You Leave It Alone (2009)\nIf I Should Fall Behind (2009) (b/w Darren Hayman Girls In Their Summer Clothes, Bruce Springsteen tribute)\nWatching Charlie's Angels (2009)\nStrawberry Cables (2009)\nSweetheart EP (2010)\nJohnny Helm Sings (2010)\nLittle Surprise (2011)\nBlue Harbour (2011)\nIn Her Kitchen (2011)\nEskimo Kiss (2012)\nSalt EP (2012)\nSpaghetti (2013)\nLisbon (2013)\nThe Woods / The Ropes (2013)\nHelen EP (2014)\nI Could Hear the Telephone (3 Floors Above Me) (2014)\nPea Green Coat (2014)\nThe Fire Alarm (2015)\nPool Hall (2016)\nThe Running Man (2016)\nCanvey Island Baby EP (2017)\nNow I Want To Hoover My Brain Clean (2017)\nFrench Cricket EP (2022)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nMoshi Moshi: The First 10 Years (2004)\nThis Town Ain't Big Enough for the 22 of Us (2006)\nBerlin Songs Vol. 2 (2007)\nCooperative Music Sampler Vol. 6 (2008)\nMoshi Moshi Singles Compilation (2008)\nPlay Some Pool (Bruce Springsteen tribute) (2009)\nMoshi Moshi Acoustic Compilation (2009)\nI Thought of You Again: Outtakes and Alternative Versions (free with Spanish magazine Rockdelux) (2011)\nWeary Engine Blues: Crossroads (2013)\n\n\n== Related appearances ==\nStreets of Philadelphia (2003) (André Herman Düne and David Tattersall)\nMadrid (2007) (Darren Hayman and the Wave Pictures)\nHayman, Watkins, Trout and Lee (2008) (Hayman, Watkins, Trout and Lee)\nDan of Green Gables (2008) (Dan of Green Gables)\nJonny \"Huddersfield\" Helm (2008) (Jonny \"Huddersfield\" Helm)\nHappy For a While (2009) (David Tattersall)\nStanley Brinks and the Wave Pictures (2009) (Stanley Brinks and the Wave Pictures)\nThe Lobster Boat (2011) (David Tattersall and Howard Hughes)\nHow to Draw Sandwiches (2011) (The Last Swimmers - Franic Rozycki & Dave Tattersall)\nAnother One Just Like That (2010) (Stanley Brinks and the Wave Pictures)\nLittle Martha (2012) (David Tattersall - instrumental solo)\nGin (2014) (Stanley Brinks and the Wave Pictures)\nMy Ass (2015) (Stanley Brinks and the Wave Pictures)\nTequila Island (2019) (Stanley Brinks and the Wave Pictures)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nThe Wave Pictures on Discogs"

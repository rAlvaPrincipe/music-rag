    "text": "Kraan is a German band based in Ulm and formed in 1970. It had several minor hits through the 1970s and 1980s.  After a break of ten years, the group reunited in 2000.  Their early style can be described as Krautrock that turned later to fusion, combining elements of both rock and jazz.\nThe band was named Kraan, after considering the name Jack Steam. The name means faucet in Dutch, a fact they were apparently unaware of at the time; it has no meaning in German, but they liked it because it was easy to remember.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current line-up ===\nPeter Wolbrandt – guitar (1970–present)\nHellmut Hattler – bass guitar (1970–present)\nJan Fride – drums (1970–1978, 1984–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nIngo Bischof (de) – keyboards (1975–2007; died 2019)\nJohannes Pappert – alto saxophone (1970–1976)\nUdo Dahmen – drums (1977–1980)\nJoo Kraus (de) – keyboards, trumpet (1987–1992)\nGerry Brown – drums, lead vocals (1979–1983)\nTomy Goldschmidt – drums (1977)\nEef Albers – guitar (1982–1983)\nMarc McMillen – keyboards, vocals (1982–1983)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n1972 Kraan\n1973 Wintrup\n1974 Andy Nogger\n1975 Let It Out\n1977 Wiederhören\n1978 Flyday\n1982 Nachtfahrt\n1983 X\n1989 Dancing In The Shade\n1991 Soul of Stone\n2003 Through\n2007 Psychedelic man\n2010 Diamonds\n2020 Sandglass\n2023 Zoup\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n1975 Kraan Live (2lp)\n1980 Tournee\n1988 Kraan Live 88\n2001 Live 2001\n2018 The Trio Years\n2019 The Trio Years - Zugabe\n2020 Finkenbach Festival 2005\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n1976 Starportrait (2lp)\n1983 2 Platten (Best of Kraan) (2lp)\n1998 The Famous Years Compiled\n2001 Berliner Ring (Demos and live recordings)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nKraan discography at Discogs\nProg Archives: Kraan discography and reviews\nJazz Music Archives: Kraan discography and reviews\n\n\n== References =="

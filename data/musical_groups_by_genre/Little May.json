The band has taken inspiration from music by The National and alt-J. After various performances in the Sydney area, the band released a self-titled EP in 2014, which they had been working on for two years. In 2015, the duo worked on their debut album in New York City.

To support the release of the album, the band went on an extensive tour through Europe, aided by bass keyboard player Mark Harding and drummer Cat Hunter. On 20 June 2015, the band performed in Netherlands on Best Kept Secret in Hilvarenbeek. On 9 October 2015 the album \"For the company\" was released.

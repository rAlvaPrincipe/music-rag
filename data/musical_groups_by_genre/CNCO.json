    "text": "CNCO was an American latin boy band based in Miami, Florida. The group consisted of Richard Camacho, Erick Brian Colón, Christopher Vélez and Zabdiel De Jesús; Joel Pimentel was a member until his departure in May 2021. They won a five-year recording contract with Sony Music Latin after becoming the winning competitors of the first season of La Banda. The band toured with Ricky Martin. Their debut and second singles \"Tan Fácil\" and \"Quisiera\", charted well soon after their debut. They released their first album, Primera Cita, on August 26, 2016, which included the hit \"Reggaetón Lento (Bailemos)\".\nThe group released their self-titled second studio album on April 6, 2018, which included the singles \"Hey DJ\",  \"Mamita\" and \"Se Vuelve Loca\". Their debut EP Que Quiénes Somos, containing the singles \"De Cero\" and \"Pegao\" (featuring Manuel Turizo), was released on October 11, 2019. Both albums debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Latin Albums and the top 40 on the Billboard 200, while the EP debuted within the top 15 of the former chart.\nIn 2020, they began the era of their album Déjà Vu, a visual cover album of Latin pop classics, with three singles released from November to December.

They all received 75% or more votes from the public during auditions except Colón, though he was saved by Martin. The band's members competed individually with other contestants from Latin America and the United States before the show's judges, Martin, Alejandro Sanz and Laura Pausini. The boys had to go through several phases to become the winners. During the competition, they were put into groups, with Camacho and De Jesús in the same band, while Vélez, Colón and Pimentel were in another. The band was formed on the finale of the show, on December 13, 2015, when they received their name, which alludes to the Spanish word for five, \"cinco\", and is pronounced in English as it is spelled: \"C-N-C-O\". They won a recording contract of 5 years with Sony Music Latin, and rapper Wisin was scheduled to produce their first album. Martin became their representative.\nThey performed the song \"Devuélveme Mi Corazón\" on the finale, which included performances by Pitbull, Fifth Harmony, Wisin, and a video congratulations from One Direction.

Wisin spoke about their album saying, \"It is a union of countries and cultures. It is what keeps us growing because the people can understand that we can unite different genres.\" The album has fourteen tracks and includes an urban remix of \"Tan Fácil\" featuring the rapper, and a ballad version of the song \"Quisiera\" featuring Spanish singer Abraham Mateo.

The band toured in support of psychedelic rockers the Ozric Tentacles in 1992. In 1993, the band were signed to Ultimate Records.\nIn 1993, Senser released two indie singles on Ultimate – \"Eject\" and \"The Key\".\nIn March 1994, Senser released their third single, \"Switch\", which entered the UK Singles Chart at number 39. Senser's first album, Stacked Up, was released in May 1994, and entered the UK Albums Chart at number 4.\nAt the beginning of 1995, Senser toured the UK supported by Skunk Anansie before setting off to tour the United States with Moby. It was during this tour that the band decided to split over musical differences. Al-Sayed and Morgan left to form a new band with Haggis called Lodestar. The remaining members of Senser found a new drummer, Paul Soden, and set about writing Senser's second album.\nIn the summer of 1998, Haigh was able to tour and the band released the second album, Asylum. Once again musical differences became apparent and by February 1999 the band decided to split.\nIn 2003, the original line-up reunited originally to perform for one show, but decided to re-form and record again. They released their third studio album SCHEMAtic in 2004. \nIn 2009, they released How To Do Battle.\nIn 2013, they released their fifth album To the Capsules via Pledgemusic and toured with Erika Footman on vocals in place of Kerstin Haigh.\nIn 2014, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their debut Stacked Up, the band re-released the album in expanded edition with a remastered version of the original tracks on the first CD, and bonus tracks from the era (remixes and previously unreleased songs) on the second disc.\nAlthough Senser have not released new music since 2014, as of 2024 the band still perform live shows.\n\n\n== Soundtracks to films ==\n\"The Key\" was used as part of the cult extreme 1990s ski film, The Tribe.\nSenser's song \"States of Mind\" from Stacked Up, was used as the soundtrack to the well-known demoscene production, State of Mind, by Bomb.\nIn 2012, one of their songs was also used in the soundtrack to the film Learning Hebrew: A Gothsploitation Movie.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\nAsylum (Limited Edition) (1998) \"Senser Vs.

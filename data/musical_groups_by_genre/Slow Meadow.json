    "text": "Slow Meadow is an American solo music project founded in Houston, Texas by Matt Kidd.  Slow Meadow creates atmospheric ambient chamber music.\n\n\n== History ==\nMatt Kidd began creating post-rock and ambient soundscapes in 2012, ultimately releasing 2 albums under the name Aural Method.  After taking a break from releasing music of his own for two years, Kidd befriended Marc Byrd of Hammock, and, with his encouragement, began creating more ambient music under his new moniker, Slow Meadow.  Slow Meadow was signed to Hammock's own label, Hammock Music, who in turn released Slow Meadow's self-titled debut album in August 2015.\nSlow Meadow performed live at The Gatherings Concert Series, presented by Star's End, in April 2016. Slow Meadow also performed a live concert for the Echoes syndicated radio program in August 2016.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSlow Meadow (2015)\nCostero (2017)\nHappy Occident (2019)\nBy the Ash Tree (2020)\nUpstream Dream (2021)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Evoke\", a musical score for the dance film \"Evoke\" (February 14, 2016)\n\"Hananel's Recovery\", an excerpt from the short documentary \"Vitals\" by director Jake Oleson (February 25, 2016)\n\"Blue Aubade\" feat.

    "text": "Tudjaat were Madeleine Allakariallak and Phoebe Atagotaaluk, two Inuit women from Nunavut, Canada who are known for their recordings and performances of traditional Inuit throat singing.\n\n\n== History ==\nTudjaat was founded in 1994 after producer Randall Prescott heard Allakariallak perform as part of a backup chorus with Susan Aglukark's third CD.  When he learned that Atagotaaluk, her cousin, was also a throat singer, he arranged to have the pair brought together with several backup musicians for a recording session which combined their traditional singing with modern guitar, keyboard, bass and drum music.  The result was a six-track CD titled Tudjaat.\nTudjaat features \"Kajusita (When My Ship Comes In)\", a song written by Allakariallak, Jon Park-Wheeler, and Randall Prescott.  The song, which describes the forced exile of a group of Inuit to the High Arctic in the last century, is a tribute to those who suffered and died as a consequence of a government decision.\n\"Kajusita\" won the CD's its producers the 1997 American Indian Film Institute Awards Best Song award, was included on a United Nations compilation CD entitled Here and Now, A celebration of Canadian Music, The Music of The First Peoples and Folk Music, and was made into a music video. Tudjaat was nominated for a Juno Award for Best Music of Aboriginal Canada in 1997, but did not win.\nThe next year Tudjaat's \"Qingauiit\", written by Jon Park-Wheeler and Randall Prescott, was included on Putumayo's A Native American Odyssey: Inuit to Inca.  Also that year the pair's singing was featured on Robbie Robertson's CD Contact from the Underworld of Redboy.\nAfter the short-lived career of Tudjaat, Allakariallak worked for the CBC Northern Service and then in 2005 became a news host on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\" Reviewed Work: Heartbeat 2: More Voices of First Nations Women by Howard Bass, Rayna Green\".

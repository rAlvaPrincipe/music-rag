    "text": "The Men were an American pop rock band from Santa Monica, California. Despite its name, the group had two women as members. The group released a self-titled album on Polygram Records in 1992 (produced and engineered by David Leonard), which hit #22 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart on the strength of the single \"Church of Logic, Sin, and Love\". The tune hit #8 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, but it was their only hit, and the group disbanded soon after. Their video got into medium rotation on MTV.\nJef Scott had fronted other LA-area bands, most notably The Jef Scott Group during the '80s. Jef has written songs featured on Sons Of Anarchy, The Vampire Diaries and 90210. Lore and David also had a side project called Jimi's Kids, which sometimes featured a past and future collaborator, Ken David Paul. Ken and David had been in two other bands together, Tocan and Kill Buddha.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJef Scott - vocals, guitar\nLore Wilhelm - vocals, guitar\nNancy Hathorn - vocals, bass\nDavid Botkin - vocals, drums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Men discography at Discogs"

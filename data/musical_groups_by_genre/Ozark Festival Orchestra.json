    "text": "The Ozark Festival Orchestra is an independent, self-sustaining, established orchestra residing in a small city in the Ozarks --- Monett, Missouri, population 7,396.  The ensemble of 40 members commissions new works, features regional and national guest soloists, and hosts a Young Artists competition annually.  It is uncommon for an American city of this size to host an orchestra, although many small American towns do have a community band.\nThe OFO has a five-concert season starting in October and ending in April or May.\nThe OFO completed its 38th season in the spring of 2018; this was the 4th season for the current conductor/musical director, Todd Borgmann.  Former musical directors include Ken Meisinger, Jordan Tang  and David Goza.\n\n\n== References =="

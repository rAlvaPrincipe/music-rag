    "text": "The Gospellers (ゴスペラーズ) are a Japanese a cappella vocal group made up of Tetsuya Murakami, Kaoru Kurosawa, Yuji Sakai, Yoichi Kitayama and Yutaka Yasuoka.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally formed by Murakami and Kurosawa (along with 4 other members) in 1991 as a group within a college chorus club \"Street Corner Symphony\" at the University of Waseda, they recruited 3 new members in order to  fill the vacancy (4 members previously left the group due to their job placement activities) for the recording of The Gospellers, their first major label release in 1994. They spent the next 6 years working towards national recognition, releasing 13 singles and 5 albums, until they finally came up with a hit single \"Towa ni\", which stayed in the Oricon chart ranking for 44 consecutive weeks in 2000 and 2001. They became the first a cappella group to be in the top 3 of the chart in Japan with their 16th single, \"Hitori\".\nIn early 2006, the group made a side-project release, Gosperats, which featured the members in blackface and singing with more soul and jazz-like accompaniment, with Rats & Star members Masayuki Suzuki, Nobuyoshi Kuwano and Yoshio Sato, who originally, along with such a style, established the popularity of R&B and Doo-wop in the 1980s in Japan.\nIn the first edition of the Japanese ice show Fantasy on Ice in 2010, the Gospellers made an appearance as guest artists. They performed together with former figure skater and figure skating commentator, Junko Yaginuma, to the song \"1, 2, 3 for 5\" amongst others.: 52 \nTheir single \"Sky High\" was used as the opening theme for the anime Nodame Cantabile: Paris.\nThe image song for the Japanese version of The Wild is called \"Prisoner of Love\" by the band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nPromise (21 December 1994)\nU'll be Mine (21 July 1995)\nWinter Cheers!〜winter special/Higher (9 November 1995)\nTwo-Way Street (1 March 1996)\nCalendar (1 July 1996)\nMachikirenai (1 November 1996)\nWolf (21 June 1997)\nOwaranai Sekai/Vol. (26 December 1997)\nYuyake Shuffle (22 April 1998)\nBOO -Onaka ga Sukuhodo Warattemitai- (20 June 1998)\nAtarashii Sekai (12 December 1998)\nNettai-ya (19 June 1999)\nPassword (1 December 1999)\nTowa ni (23 August 2000)\nKokuhaku (6 December 2000)\nHitori (7 March 2001)\nYakusoku no Kisetsu (1 August 2001)\nChikai (14 November 2001)\nGet me on (20 February 2002)\nEscort (10 April 2002)\nHoshikuzu no Machi (13 November 2002)\nRight on,Babe (16 July 2003)\nShin Osaka (22 October 2003)\nMachikado -on the corner- (28 January 2004)\nMimosa (27 October 2004)\nHitosuji no Kiseki/Kaze wo Tsukamaete (24 May 2006)\nPlatinum Kiss (18 October 2006)\nHinoataru Sakamichi (18 October 2006)\nPlatinum Kiss/Hinoataru Sakamichi (1 January 2007)\nIt still matters～ Ai wa nemuranai feat.

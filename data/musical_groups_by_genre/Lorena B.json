Since its inception, the band has created a live show with a variety of sounds, mixing rock and electronica. With the release of their self-produced debut album, Siblings, Lorena B went on their first tour in the UK. Songs from the album were played on the Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service show on BBC Radio 6 Music, London's XFM, and on many blogs around the net. The first single, \"Swallow my Gum\" released a music video that received media comment, and has been played on MTV IL. Since the band's conception, Lorena B has cooperated with DJs, such as dubstep producer Borgore; they have also played as main support for the American rock trio Blonde Redhead and for the Canadian electro duo, Junior Boys.\n\n\n== Siblings ==\n\nSiblings (Released 30 April 2011) was self-produced by the band in a process that took over a year.

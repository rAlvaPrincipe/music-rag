    "text": "Oh Honey was an American indie pop band from Brooklyn, New York, formed by singer-songwriters Mitchy Collins and Danni Bouchard. Their touring live band consisted of drummer Rob Ernst, guitarist Ian Holubiak, and bassist Shaun Savage. Oh Honey described itself as a blend of folk pop, indie pop, and pop music.\n\n\n== History ==\nMitchy Collins started Oh Honey as a project following his associations with the Kin and Outasight. Looking for a female vocalist, he met Danni Bouchard through a mutual friend.\nOh Honey began recording in Brooklyn, NY as a group in April 2013, releasing its first single in September 2013. The band is named after both the \"Oh Honey\" episode of How I Met Your Mother and the artisan, rooftop honey production movement in Brooklyn. Oh Honey's EP, With Love, was released independently in November 2013 and was well-reviewed.\nIn December 2013, Oh Honey worked with Orange Is the New Black stars Danielle Brooks and Uzo Aduba to create a Christmas medley. Throughout the end of 2013 and the start of 2014, the single \"Be Okay\" gained quick and steady acclaim, being covered on Glee on the March 25, 2014, episode titled \"New Directions\".\nAfter signing to Atlantic Records in February 2014 via its Fueled by Ramen imprint, Oh Honey set up three tours as the opening act to James Blunt, the Fray, and American Authors, and played at SXSW. The EP With Love was re-released under the Atlantic Records label on March 25, 2014. On August 12, 2014, Oh Honey released an EP of remixes of \"Be Okay\".\nIn the fall of 2014, \"Be Okay\" was featured in national commercials for The Hundred-Foot Journey, the new ABC show Selfie, and the Chili's restaurant chain. On October 11, 2014, Oh Honey released a second EP of original music titled Sincerely Yours. The band indicated that 4 EPs, With Love, Sincerely Yours, Wish You Were Here and the unreleased Until Next Time would culminate as a full series called Postcards; however, this did not materialize.\nOh Honey cited its influences from a number of sources including Ingrid Michaelson, Sara Bareilles, Regina Spektor, Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks, Bon Iver, Bruce Springsteen, and Ryan Adams. Oh Honey's sound has been compared to Of Monsters and Men, American Authors, Sara Bareilles, the Lumineers, and Icona Pop.\nAfter Collins split from Bouchard in 2016 to form Lovelytheband, Bouchard began recording as a solo artist under the name Luxtides.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\n\nMitchy Collins – songwriting, vocals, guitar\nDanni Bouchard – songwriting, vocals, tambourine\nTouring musicians\n\nIan Holubiak – guitar\nRob Ernst – drums\nShaun Savage – bass\nRob Guariglia – bass\nChris Greatti – guitar\nPaul Dominic – bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nWith Love (2013)\nBe Okay Remixes (2014)\nSincerely Yours (2014)\nWish You Were Here (2015)\n\n\n=== Charting singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Neptune is an experimental / industrial noise rock band originally hailing from Boston, Massachusetts. Throughout its 30 year history, the band has largely operated as a collective, not only by employing a rotating membership, but also often collaborating with other musicians and artists both live and on record. They are noted for having built their custom-made instruments out of scrap steel and other found-object and recycled materials. The instruments themselves can be heavy and foreboding \"self-made from antiquated machines and scrap metal, forged at extreme angles like props from a German expressionist film.\" A reviewer once said of the band: \"Neptune really do accurately approximate in their music the tragic and violent desolation of the auto graveyards from which they draw their raw materials.\" While another wrote: \"Neptune’s closest comparison could only be themselves.\"\n\n\n== Band history ==\n\nNeptune's origins trace to 1994 as a sculpture project by Boston artist/musician Jason Sanford, who forged the band's haphazard guitars and reluctant drums from scrap steel and found objects.  Over the years the instruments have evolved to incorporate oscillators and other electronic devices as band \"have integrated some really smart looking industrial class synthesizer gear\" into their noise-making arsenal. Nine (+) lineups, Thirty-three releases and hundreds of instruments later, the band continues to wrench its sound spatter on self-built instruments to often confounded audiences around the world. As of 2024, the band has played over 700 shows, with a recent US tour in June 2023.\nHaving toured extensively, Neptune has shared stages with \"a variety of artists such as The Ex, Mission of Burma, Ut, Oneida, Lightning Bolt, The Flaming Lips, Blonde Redhead, Melt-Banana, Charles Hayward, Liars, Black Dice, James Chance & the Contortions, Gang Gang Dance, Six Finger Satellite, Wolf Eyes.\", Enon, Erase Errata, Arab on Radar and Parts & Labor.\nAs of 2020, Neptune consists of Sanford along with long-time Neptune collaborators Mark William Pearson and Daniel Paul Boucher.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCurrent members\n\nJason Sidney Sanford – guitar, baritone guitar, bass, violin, gas can ukulele, electric thumb piano, electronics, foot-controlled synthesizer, bass lamellophone, spring harp, percussion, feedback organ, tupperphone, radios, vocals (1994 - present)\nMark William Pearson – guitar, baritone guitar, 4-string slide, bass, electronics, large electric spring, percussion, amplified drums, tape machine, tape manipulation, push-button telephone, vocals (2002 - 2015, 2020 - present)\nDaniel Paul Boucher – drums, amplified metal toms, found object percussion, saw blade xylophone, oscillators, electronics, violin, gas can ukulele, washboard, vocals (2000 - 2010, 2015, 2020 - Present)\nRotating members\n\nKevin Micka – recording engineer, live sound engineer (1997 - present), drums, guitar, electronics, backing vocals (2006 - 2016)\nPast members\n\nDarryl Blood - drums, violin, backing vocals (1994 - 1997)\nDoug Last - percussion, empties (empty glass bottles shattered on a cinderblock with attached microphone), backing vocals (1994 - 1997)\nCarl Wieting- bass, guitar, ukulele, backing vocals (1994 - 1997)\nGregory Kenney - guitar, vocals, drums (1994 - 1998)\nMalcolm Felder - drums (1997 - 1998)\nJessica Rylan - bass, vocals, electronics (1997-1999, 2001, 2006-2007)\nAdrienne Jorge - live projections / films, documentarian (1998 - 1999, 2002 - 2005)\nAdam Scotto - drums (1999)\nJoel Hamburger - bass (2000)\nChristopher Huggins - guitar, vocals, bass (2000 - 2002)\nJohn Douglas Manson - drums, percussion, vocals (2000 - 2004)\nJustin Kaiden - bass (2001)\nDavid Gerhard Utzinger - live sound engineer (2005), percussion (2008)\nKenneth Wagner Linehan - homemade synthesizer (2008)\nRegina Greene - vocals (obscenities), booking (2005 - 2013)\nMary Staubitz - electronics, tone generator, feedback (2006 - 2007)\nMartina Rossi - guitar (live) (2009)\nFarhad Ebrihimi - drums, electronics (2007; 2010 - 2011)\nJustin Earl Kipp - percussion, bowed cable, electronics (2016)\nJesse Gallagher - percussion, bowed cable, electronics (2016)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nStudio Recordings, May MCMXCVII (Archenemy Records, 1999)\nThe Ballet of Process (Mister Records / 100% Breakfast Records, 2002)\nIntimate Lightning (Mister Records / 100% Breakfast Records, 2004)\nPatterns (Self-Release Records (US) / Fortissimo Records (UK) / Les Potagers Natures (France), 2006)\nNeptune (Golden Lab Records, 2007)\nGong Lake (Radium / Table of the Elements, February 2008)\n18:40/19:19 (Magnetism Crafts / Wrong Way Archival Bureau, 2010)\nSilent Partner (Northern Spy Records, 2011)\nmsg rcvd (Northern Spy Records, 2012)\nMother of Millions (Wrong Way Archival Bureau, 2021)\nGreen White Red (Magnetism Crafts / Wrong Way Archival Bureau, 2024)\nLive albums\n\nLive on Pipeline, WMBR 03.16.04 (Neptune self-released, 2019)\nLive at SCSI Cell 11.20.2004 (Neptune self-released, 2021)\nMini-albums\n\nMice and Worms (Magnetism Crafts / Self-Release Records, 2005)\nCave Drawings (Self-Release Records / Magnetism Crafts, January 2011)\nEPs\n\nKnife Fight E.P., 7-inch (Neptune self-released, 1996)\nNeptune., 3-song cassette (Neptune self-released, 1998)\nBasement Recordings E.P., 6-song CD (Mister Records, 2001)\nGreen Cassette, 5-song C30 cassette (Magnetism Crafts, 2005)\n3\" CDR, 5-song CD-R (Magnetism Crafts, 2005)\nWhite Cassette, 4-song C20 cassette (Wrong Way Archival Bureau, 2005)\n3\" Collage CDR, 2 songs (Magnetism Crafts / Self-Release Records, 2006)\nRed Cassette, 6 improvisations, C30 cassette (Magnetism Crafts, 2006)\n3\" CDR, 3-song 3\" CD-R (Hiddenbirdhouse, 2006)\nTell My People to Go Home, 4-song EP, split release w/ One Second Riot, LP only (Distile Records, 2007)\nParis Green, 5-track CD-R (Magnetism Crafts / Wrong Way Archival Bureau, 2007)\nRoman Business, 4 songs, C20 cassette (NOFI, March 2009)\nSingles\n\n\"Swang!/Poodle Walk\", 7-inch single (Anti-Social Records, 1996)\n\"Your Company/Productivity Is a Science\", 7-inch single (Heliotrope Records, 2000)\n\"At the Pink Pony/A Car Is a Weapon\", Live 7-inch single (Mister Records, 2002)\n\n\n== Videos ==\nEquestrian Phantasy.

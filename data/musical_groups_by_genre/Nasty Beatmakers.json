Mollings).\nThe duo produced Lil Wayne's \"I'm Me\", Plies's \"#1 Fan\", and Ludacris's \"Grew Up a Screw Up\".\n\n\n== Early life and career beginnings ==\nDJ Nasty and LVM were both born in Cuba, and came to the United States in 1988 due to their father being in the Navy; he \"wanted a change in scenery\", states Nasty.  DJ Nasty early on met DJ Khaled and another associate named Ceaser and started Hitmen Productions. They were doing local house parties and renting out halls, and soon started to make a big name for themselves in Orlando, Florida. The group eventually broke up.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArticle in Ozone magazine\nInterview in Pure Cash magazine"

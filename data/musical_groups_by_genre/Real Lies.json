    "text": "Real Lies are a London electronic group, formed by Kev Kharas, Tom Watson and Patrick King. They released their debut album Real Life in 2015. They are now a duo after Watson left the band.\nThe band are from the Holloway area of London and reference the boroughs of Islington and Haringey in their tracks. Their second album, Lad Ash, was released in April 2022.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nThe band formed after Kharas and Watson, who met \"passing cans between each other in the queue for some shit club\" moved into a house next to a reservoir in North London. King, who knew Watson from playing football as teenagers, would often DJ at their house parties which lasted for two or three days at a time. The trio began working on songs, often based around samples found by King. An early run of singles included the songs \"Deeper\" and \"World Peace\", which were released together on vinyl in 2013. \"World Peace\", based around a sample of Jean-Luc Ponty's \"Computer Incantations For World Peace\", was named as Zane Lowe's 'Hottest Record in the World'. This was followed by \"North Circular\" – which sampled Ron Trent, and Chez Damier – \"Dab Housing\", \"Seven Sisters\" and \"Blackmarket Blues\".\nThe trio also hosted club nights, the Boy's Own-influenced Congress, Eternal which saw secret DJ sets from Evian Christ, Jacques Greene, Jamie xx and Terry Farley and Luxury which took place in a working timber yard.\n\n\n== Real Life ==\nTheir debut album Real Life was released in 2015, receiving positive reviews from NME, The Guardian and Clash.\nExpanding to a five-piece for live shows, the band embarked on a UK tour with Foals in 2015, played festivals such as Glastonbury Festival, Bestival, MIDI and the Jamie xx-curated Nuits Sonores, and recorded a pair of Maida Vale sessions for BBC Radio 1. In 2016, they released the single \"One Club Town\", sampling \"Fascinating Rhythm\" by Bassomatic. A video for the song, directed by Jonathan Entwistle, was premiered by i-D in February 2016.\n\n\n== UNREAL ==\nAfter Real Life, the band started working on new music but were unhappy with the material, which was eventually scrapped.\nIn April 2018, \"The Checks\" was released on their own UNREAL label. Clash Magazine called it \"a gritty, rave empowered return.\" This was followed by \"White Flowers\" – a collaboration with British producer Tom Demac – was released through Kompakt, and reviewed favourably by Pitchfork. While in November 2018, Real Lies appeared on Icarus' single \"Man of the Land\".\nDuring this time, they also released a series of mixes on SoundCloud called UNREAL RADIO, featuring a number of unreleased \"Late Editions\".\nIn October 2019, it was revealed that Watson had left the band.\n\n\n== Lad Ash ==\nIn November 2019, Real Lies released their first single as a duo, \"You Were In Love\". This was followed in February 2020 by \"Boss Trick\", an ode to Watson. A video for the song was premiered by Crack Magazine.\n\nIn an accompanying interview, Kharas revealed they were working on a collection of new songs called Lad Ash:\"Each song from Lad Ash is a farewell to something, but also about finding solace in what you're left with and excitement in something new. The ‘L' word is loaded, I know. But I wanted to confront it head-on, show the distance between then and now.\"Their new material was described in Paste as featuring \"the poetic depiction of love and alienation that made their debut so compelling.\"\nIn March 2020, Real Lies were forced to postpone their \"first proper tour in five years\" due to the global coronavirus pandemic. They later streamed a live concert via Facebook, debuting a cover of A Rainy Night in Soho by The Pogues, which was made available for digital download for a limited time to raise money for the Trussell Trust.\nOn 9 Feb 2022, Real Lies released \"An Oral History Of My First Kiss\", the next single from Lad Ash, and revealed that the album will be released on 22 April 2022.\nLad Ash received favourable reviews from many publications, and was included in end of year reviews by The Quietus, The New Yorker, God Is In The TV and Nialler9.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nReal Life (2015)\nLad Ash (2022)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nPet Shop Boys - \"Say It To Me\" (Real Lies Remix), 15 September 2016\nTwo Door Cinema Club - \"Bad Decisions\" (Real Lies Remix), 28 October 2016\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

    "text": "Walela is a trio of singers, named for the Cherokee word for hummingbird. The group was founded in 1996 by sisters Rita Coolidge and Priscilla Coolidge, with Priscilla's daughter Laura Satterfield as the third member. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nFeatured as part of Robbie Robertson and the Red Road Ensemble's album Music for The Native Americans, Walela is known for their distinctive vocal blend. During the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Walela performed extensively in the Olympic Park. Their 1997 debut release on Capitol Records earned them the recognition of the Nammy Awards (Native American Music Awards) where they took home the award for Debut Artist of the Year and Song of the Year for \"The Warrior\".\nDuring the 2010s, there was controversy at the Native American Music Awards due to allegations that none of Walela's members were Native American. The Native American Music Awards allows any person who self-identifies as Native American to receive awards without any verification of tribal citizenship. The Coolidge family is not enrolled in any Native American tribe. Rita Coolidge has said that their great-aunt was on the Trail of Tears and that she \"did a lot of research\", but that \"we were not able to get the documents to prove that our ancestors were on the Trail\" and could not find any ancestors listed on \"the official government roll\".\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe group won the Native American Music Awards' best debut group and song of the year for 1998.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Walela (1997) ===\nIs Everybody Here\nCherokee River\nWash Your Spirit Clean\nThe Warrior\nMuddy Road\nCherokee\nCherokee Morning Song\nWounded Knee\nThe Whippoorwill\nCircle of Light\nEarth Children\nAmazing Grace (in Cherokee)\nI'll Turn My Radio On\n\n\n=== Unbearable Love (2000) ===\nGathering of Eagles\nThe Sequence\nCherokee Rose\nI Know I Don't Walk on Water\nSmoke in the Wind\nBright Morning Star\nI Have No Indian Name\nTell Them They Lie\nWhen It Comes\nWhen Love Was All We Knew\nGod Save Us from Ourselves\nUnbearable Love\n\n\n=== Live in Concert (2004) ===\nThe Gathering of Eagles\nCherokee River\nCherokee Rose\nWash Your Spirit Clean\nI Have No Indian Name\nWhen It Comes\nMuddy Road\nWhen Love Was All We Knew\nCherokee Morning Song\nWounded Knee\nTell Them They Lied\nGod Save Us From Ourselves\n\n\n=== The Best of Walela (2007) ===\nIs Everybody Here\nCherokee Morning Star\nAmazing Grace\nBright Morning Star\nSmoke In the Wind\nWash Your Spirit Clean\nThe Warrior\nCherokee Rose\nI'll Turn My Radio On\nI Have No Indian Name\nGod Save Us From Ourselves\nWhen It Comes\nThe Whippoorwill\nUnbearable Love\n\n\n== References =="

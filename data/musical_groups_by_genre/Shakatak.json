Following an initial white label release, \"Steppin\", the band's name was derived from a record store in Soho, London Record Shack with the name created by Les McCutcheon, Passion records label owner and Northern Soul DJ Kev Roberts, It was they who first showed interest in the initial single.\nShakatak scored a number of chart entries, including two Top 10 hits in the UK Singles Chart, \"Night Birds\" (1982) and \"Down on the Street\" (1984), plus a further 12 entries in the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles.

This record introduced their instrumental-unison vocal sound to a much wider audience, and the track stayed in the UK Singles Chart for seventeen weeks.  The follow-up, \"Night Birds\" (1982), was their first single to reach the top ten and it also peaked in Australia at number 92. The album of the same name gave Shakatak their first gold album, entering at number four and remaining in the charts for twenty-eight weeks.  Jill Saward (formerly of Fusion Orchestra, Brandy and Citizen Gang) became their sole lead singer to make Shakatak's fifth album, Down on the Street (1984). \nThe band gained a huge popularity in Japan, were they released a series of largely instrumental albums such as Da Makani (1988) exclusively for the Japanese market. Manic & Cool, featuring the night club and chart hit \"Mr Manic & Sister Cool\" was released internationally in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, the band achieved success in the US when their 1992 album Open Your Eyes went to No 1 in the contemporary jazz charts. The 1997 album Full Circle expanded their sound with hip hop-beats.\nStill active, the band has released and number of albums in the 2000s and celebrated their thirtieth anniversary year in 2010, marking the occasion with the release of the album Across the World the following year.\n\n\n== Independent projects ==\nBassist George Anderson released his second solo album, Expressions, on 3 September 2012 through Secret Records.

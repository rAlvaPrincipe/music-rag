    "text": "Priscilla Marie Winans Love, known professionally as CeCe Winans,  (born October 8, 1964) is an American gospel singer who has garnered 15 Grammy Awards, the most for any female gospel singer; 31 GMA Dove Awards, 19 Stellar Awards, 7 NAACP Image Awards, 1 Billboard Music Award along with many other awards and honors to her credit including being one of the inaugural inductees into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame in Atlanta, Georgia. Winans is the best-selling and most awarded female gospel singer of all time, and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Music City Walk of Fame.\nWinans has 19 million record sales certified by RIAA. She first rose to prominence between the 1980s as a member of the double platinum selling Gospel duo BeBe & CeCe Winans with her brother, Bebe Winans; before launching her own highly acclaimed solo career. Billboard magazine lists all of her solo albums as top Gospel, Christian, and R&B music sellers, and six albums as a duo with her older brother Bebe.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPriscilla Marie Winans was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Delores and David Winans of the famed Winans Family Gospel group, on October 8, 1964. She is one of 10 children. Her parents were part of the Church of God in Christ and would only listen to gospel music. She sang her first solo at the age of 8.\n\n\n== Duo with BeBe Winans ==\nWinans first went to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1981 as a singer on the Christian telecast The PTL Club, hosted by Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. Although originally part of the larger Winans family singing group, CeCe and her older brother BeBe became a duo during their time at PTL, in response to positive reactions to their version of the song \"Up Where We Belong\" sung as a duet, with lyrics changed for Christian audiences. In 1984, CeCe and Bebe released their first album, Lord Lift Us Up, for PTL Records. They achieved crossover success, eventually releasing nine Gold and Platinum recordings, billed as BeBe & CeCe Winans. Winans left PTL in 1984 just before getting married. Her brother left in 1985. They released their second album in 1987: BeBe & CeCe Winans. BeBe & CeCe Winans are the first gospel artists to have their album Different Lifestyles sell over a million units, only the second gospel album to do so after Amazing Grace by Aretha Franklin.\n\n\n== Solo career ==\nWinans began her solo career with the album Alone in His Presence, released in 1995. It was only the third album by a gospel artist to sell more than a million units. CeCe, along with her brother BeBe, also hold the honor of having the first gospel album to reach platinum by a gospel artist. \"Alone In His Presence\" earned her a Grammy Award and two Dove Awards, including the Female Vocalist of the Year. Winans's next release, the Gold-certified Everlasting Love, was released in 1998 and featured Winans' highest-charting solo singles: \"Well Alright\" and \"Slippin\". The song \"On That Day\" from the album was written and produced by R&B singer Lauryn Hill. Later that year, Winans released His Gift; a holiday album.\nIn 1999, Winans started her own recording company, PureSprings Gospel. Her first album on the label was Alabaster Box in 1999. Some production of the disc was done by Gospel singer and musician Fred Hammond. It included a guest appearance by Take 6.

Live in the Throne Room contained tracks from all of Winans's albums. Around September 2004, Winans experienced what she thought was a flu but turned out to be a serious stomach infection and was hospitalized immediately for surgery. Due to the extended recovery time, the second half of the Throne Room Tour was postponed to early 2005.\nWinans's seventh album Purified was released in 2005.

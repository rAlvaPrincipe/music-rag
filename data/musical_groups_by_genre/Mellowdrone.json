    "text": "Mellowdrone is an American rock band from Los Angeles, formed in 1999.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMellowdrone originated as Jonathan Bates' solo project, but expanded to a full band with Tony DeMatteo (guitar and keyboards), Scott Ellis (drums) and Greg Griffith (bass). Griffith and Ellis were later replaced by Camila Gutierrez and Brian Borg respectively. The band's music encompasses a range of styles from lo-fi, indie rock and experimental.\nTheir debut album, Box, was released in 2006 on Columbia Records. Shortly after, Gutierrez formed Uh Huh Her and left Mellowdrone. The band continued as a three-piece, with Bates taking over as bassist. Their follow-up album, Angry Bear, was released in 2009 on Coming Home Records.\nMellowdrone's music has appeared on several television shows, including Project Runway, Six Feet Under, and Cane.  \"C'Mon Try A Little Bit\" was featured in the opening scene of Driv3r. Their song \"Oh My\" was featured on the FIFA 07 soundtrack and the horror movie Prom Night. \"Fashionably Uninvited\" was included in the soundtrack for the 2007 film The Invisible. \"Orange Marmalade\" was featured in the 2008 film Never Back Down and in the film Fling. \"Beautiful Day\" was featured on Project Gotham Racing 2.\nAfter becoming frustrated with the logistics of a full band, Jonathan Bates began a solo project in 2010, dubbed Big Black Delta. He has also played as a touring musician for M83.\nIn 2017, members of The Neighbourhood who were fans of Mellowdrone contacted Jonathan and Tony for a collaboration. Both members accepted, leading to them meeting for the first time in eight years. The two were inspired to start writing songs together again, and Mellowdrone was eventually revived as a band, producing an EP in 2018.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== ...Boredom Never Sounded So Sweet ===\nEP (1999)\n[48-17-6]\nRide (Finish Me Off)\nBitelip\nMy First Love Song\nMonsters\nJustine\nSpoiled Boy\nHappy Together\n\n\n=== Glassblower ===\nEP (2001)\nFall On Your Knees\nYou And I\nGlassblower\nIt All Makes Sense Now\n#3\n\n\n=== A Demonstration of Intellectual Property ===\nEP (2003)\nTinylittle\nFashionably Uninvited\nAnd Repeat\nNo More Options\nRidealong\nBeautiful Day\nBitelip\n\n\n=== Go Get 'Em Tiger ===\nEP (2004)\nBonemarrow\nWorst Song Ever\nMotivation\nI'm Too Young\nPretty Boy\nAnglophile\n\n\n=== Box ===\n(2006)\nC'Mon Try A Little Bit\nOh My\nFour Leaf Clover\nFashionably Uninvited\nBeautiful Day\nFuck It Man\nWhatever The Deal\nMadison\nAnd Repeat\nOrange Marmalade\nAmazing\nBone Marrow\nLimb To Limb\n\n\n=== Maquina 7\" ===\n(2008)\nMaquina\nMachine (En Espanol)\nSettle the Hum (B-Side)\nWouldn't Mind (B-Side)\n\n\n=== Angry Bear ===\n(2009)\nWherever You May Go\nElephant\nAlone=In Your Face\nEsmeralda\nBig Winner\nSugar\nDrinking Song\nLady in Her Underwear\nLogged Hours\nButton\nJumping Off the Pier\nDMT\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\nEP (2018)\nI Don't Believe It\nWay Out\n\n\n=== 3 ===\nEP (2018)\nLet It Out\nPascal's Wager\nI Forgive You\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMellowdrone website"

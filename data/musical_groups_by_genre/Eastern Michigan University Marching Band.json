    "text": "The Eastern Michigan University Marching Band (The Pride of the Peninsula) serves as Eastern Michigan University's marching band.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe band was first formed in 1894, however the marching band was only a student-funded extra-curricular activity that performed in parades, concerts, and athletic events, it wasn't until 1924 that the band was officially recognized as an ensemble within the Normal Conservatory of Music due to the efforts of Normal Mathematics Professor J.F. Barnhill. Professor Barnhill brought Captain Wilfred Wilson, conductor of the Michigan Band, to the Ypsilanti campus as the first Director of the marching band. The first recorded mention of the “Huron Band” was on October 31, 1925, when 48 uniformed bandmen paraded the streets of Ypsilanti and later played at the Normal-Kalamazoo College football game. In 1964, Thomas Tyra was appointed director of bands at the university and in 1968, Max Plank joined the EMU Bands program as Tyra's assistant. Together they forged a lifelong collaboration and friendship that would result in significant growth of the EMU Bands program and its traditions.  Tyra arranged the \"Eagles Fight Song\" for marching band, composed the team cheer \"Go Green,\" and the \"EMU Fanfare,\" all pregame traditionals that are played today.\n\n\n== Organization ==\n\n\n=== Director ===\nDr. J.

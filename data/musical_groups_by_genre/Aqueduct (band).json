    "text": "Aqueduct is an American, Seattle, Washington-based indie pop band, originally hailing from Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States. Initially the band was a one-man act, created and produced by David Terry in his bedroom. Supporting members have more recently been added to the group.  Aqueduct has played with Seattle bands United State of Electronica, Modest Mouse, and Death Cab for Cutie among others.  They have received praise for their application of synthpop meter, drum, and piano, which has become more complex as the band has grown in membership.\n\n\n== History ==\nAqueduct was founded in Tulsa as the solo project of pop aficionado David Terry. Twelve hours after relocating to Seattle from Tulsa in 2003, Aqueduct was opening for Modest Mouse at The Showbox.\nAfter months of culling and polishing new and pre-existing material with the help of producer Matt Pence, Aqueduct completed an EP, Pistols at Dawn, and the full-length album I Sold Gold. Of the debut album, Pitchfork Media said David Terry's \"personal, cerebral pop [is] worth coming back to.\" The follow-up Or Give Me Death was released in February 2007 by Barsuk Records.\nIn 2015 Aqueduct returned with the album Wild Knights, coinciding with the successful funding of the Aqueduct Vinyl Project on Kickstarter.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nDavid Terry – Vocals, Piano, Synthesizer, Clavinet, Rhodes, Guitar, Bass\nMatthew Nader – Guitar, Bass, Vocals, Percussion\nAndy Fitts – Bass, Vocals\nMatt Pence - Drums\nKimo Muraki - Pedal Steel, Coronet, Tenor & Alto Sax, Bass Clarinet, Flute\n\n\n=== Past ===\nChris Whitten – drums\nDavid Bynum – bass\nChris Barnes – bass\nJason Holstrom – guitar\nColin Carmichael – drums\nJeff Johnston – bass\nJames McCalister – drums\nAndrew Rudd – drums, guitar, vocals\nJustin Wilmore – bass\nNoah Ritter – bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\nPower Ballads (2003) - Barsuk Records\nPistols at Dawn (2004) - Barsuk Records\nI Sold Gold (2005) - Barsuk Records\nOr Give Me Death (2007) - Barsuk Records\nWild Knights (2015) - Aqueduct Music\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAqueduct's official site\nPress\nAqueduct discography at MusicBrainz\nAqueduct Interview at Press Play and Record\nAqueduct at Rolling Stone\nAqueduct news, reviews, and interview at Three Imaginary Girls"

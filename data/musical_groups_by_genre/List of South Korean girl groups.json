    "text": "South Korean girl groups refer to the all-female idol groups who are part of the K-pop industry. Korean girl groups have aided in the globalization of Korean culture. The Jeogori Sisters and The Kim Sisters have been noted as the origins of South Korean girl groups, the latter being the first South Korean group to succeed in the United States. First generation girl groups such as S.E.S. and Fin.K.L, are cited to have laid the groundwork for the Korean Wave in the 2000s. In 2009, Wonder Girls' \"Nobody\" became the first K-pop song to enter the Billboard Hot 100.\nThe \"Golden Age of Girl Groups\" refers to a significant shift in the K-pop industry characterized by the dominance of girl groups in music charts and album sales. This phenomenon gained prominence in the early 2020s, highlighted by the remarkable success of groups such as Blackpink, which became the first girl group to achieve \"double million seller\" status with over 2.14 million copies sold of their second full-length album, Born Pink. Other notable girl groups, including Aespa, Ive, and NewJeans,  have also emerged as major players, achieving significant sales and chart success.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nThe rise of girl groups is attributed to a growing female fandom that actively supports these artists. Recent data indicates that women now represent a substantial portion of album buyers, with reports suggesting that over 73% of the purchasers of Ive's single album After Like and more than 82% of NewJeans' album buyers are female. This shift challenges previous norms in the K-pop fandom landscape, where girl groups were traditionally supported primarily by male fans.\nIn contrast to earlier generations, which often featured girl groups with \"innocent\", \"cute,\" or \"sexy\" concepts aimed at male audiences, contemporary girl groups are increasingly embracing themes of empowerment and independence. They showcase confident lyrics and performances, reflecting a broader societal change. Critics have noted that the modern girl groups, such as (G)I-dle, Le Sserafim, and Ive incorporate diverse musical styles and concepts, moving away from the previously dominant \"sexy\" image. The expansion of the K-pop industry into global markets has further influenced the rise of girl groups. This transition has resulted in a growing focus on themes that resonate with women and Generation Z, contributing to the diversification of the K-pop music landscape.\n\n\n== Generation 1 ==\nSouth Korean girl groups that debuted in 1997 to 2002, arranged in alphabetical order.\n\n\n=== Best-selling girl groups ===\n\n\n=== Other girl groups ===\n\n\n== Generation 2 ==\nSouth Korean girl groups that debuted in 2003 to 2011, arranged in alphabetical order.\n\n\n=== Best-selling girl groups ===\n\n\n=== Other girl groups ===\n\n\n== Generation 3 ==\nSouth Korean girl groups that debuted in 2012 to 2017, arranged in alphabetical order.\n\n\n=== Best-selling girl groups ===\nGeneration 3 South Korean girl groups that have a million-seller single on Circle Digital Chart, formerly Gaon Digital Chart.\n\n\n=== Other girl groups ===\n\n\n== Generation 4 ==\nSouth Korean girl groups that debuted since 2018, arranged in alphabetical order.\n\n\n=== Best-selling girl groups ===\nGeneration 4 South Korean girl groups that have multiple platinum-certified albums from Korea Music Content Association.\n\n\n=== Other girl groups ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of girl groups\nList of best-selling girl groups\nList of South Korean boy bands\nList of South Korean idol groups\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

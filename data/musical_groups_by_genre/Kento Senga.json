    "text": "Kento Senga (Japanese: 千賀健永, Hepburn: Kento Senga, born March 23, 1991) is a Japanese singer, actor and artist who is a member of boy band Kis-My-Ft2 and its derivative group Busaiku(舞祭組) under Starto Entertainment. His nickname is Sen-chan.\n\n\n== History ==\nSenga admires Michael Jackson and has studied dance since childhood. When he visited an Arashi concert at the age of 11 because his mother's friend was acquainted with Sho Sakurai of Arashi, he was so impressed by Michael's live-like performance that he hoped to join Johnny & Associates.\nAfter auditioning, he joined Johnny & Associates on April 13, 2003, at the age of 12.\nAfter joining several groups as a trainee (Johnny's Jr.), he was selected as a member of Kis-My-Ft2 in 2005 and made his CD debut with Everybody Go on August 10, 2011, seven years after their formation.\nOn December 13, 2013, Busaiku was formed from Kis-My-Ft2 with Toshiya Miyata, Wataru Yokoo and Takashi Nikaido produced by Masahiro Nakai who was a member of SMAP.\nHe made his first film appearance in Kadokawa movie Bi-location released on January 18, 2014, playing the role of Takumi Mitarai in a dual role.\nHe often uses his dance skills to choreograph songs for Kis-My-Ft2.\nSenga is also an artist, in 2023 he held a solo exhibition FiNGAiSM which featured over 110 works in Tokyo and Taiwan.\n\n\n== Commitment to Beauty ==\nSenga's mother is a beautician who runs an esthetic salon, and because of her influence, he began applying lotion to his face in the third grade of elementary school. Senga is particular about lotion and uses as many as 11 different bottles, which is mentioned in the lyrics of the song We are Kis-My-Ft2, which introduces the members. Senga often says, \"I don't do beauty regimens without evidence,\" and only practices beauty regimens that have evidence. When choosing cosmetics, he says he checks the list of ingredients on the back of the package before purchasing.\nIn August 2021, when he appeared as Kis-My-Ft2 on FNS Laugh & Music, a live singing program hosted by Masahiro Nakai, a senior of Johnny's, Nakai revealed that Senga had injected hyaluronic acid into his cheeks, which made the Internet This became news. Later, on another talk show, Senga blurted out, \"I am Nakai's junior, but I wanted him to get my permission before talking about it,\" but Nakai said he was glad it was a topic of conversation and was popular. Perhaps because of this, Senga has been increasingly invited as a guest on beauty programs in recent years, often giving advice to female guests. 2024 saw the release of a face pack that he produced himself. He is friends with Matt Kuwata, a model and TV personality known for his unique makeup, and they exchange information on the latest beauty methods and beauty equipment.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Choreography ==\nKis-My-Ft2\n\nKis-My-Ft2 Small group song\n\n\"ConneXion\"\n\nKento Senga solo song\n\n\"Buzz\"\n\nMusical Dream Boys\n\n\"Fragrance\"\n\nTravis Japan\n\n\"Lock Lock\"\n\"Take it!

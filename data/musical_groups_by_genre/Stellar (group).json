    "text": "Stellar (Korean: 스텔라) was a South Korean girl group whose final lineup was composed of Minhee, Hyoeun, Soyoung and Youngheun that disbanded in 2018. Formed in 2011 by The Entertainment Pascal, the group attracted attention as they were initially produced by Eric Mun of the boy band Shinhwa.\nFollowing an unsuccessful debut with the single \"Rocket Girl\" in August 2011, Stellar underwent a line-up change and released \"UFO\" in February 2012, which fared similarly. The group began working with production team MonoTree in July 2013 and released \"Study\", which experienced modest success and became their first single to chart in the top 100 of the Gaon Digital Chart.\nStellar gained notoriety in February 2014, when they adopted a more \"provocative\" image for the release of their first extended play Marionette. The album's title track peaked at number thirty-five on the Gaon Digital Chart, making it their most commercially successful single. This stylistic change in direction would be maintained in Stellar's subsequent releases \"Vibrato\" in 2015 and their second extended play Sting in 2016.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2011–2014: Formation, debut and line-up changes ===\nThe formation of Stellar began as early as 2010, originally supposed to be a six-membered group with a former trainee from Japan, but Top Class Entertainment reported that member Kim Gayoung had signed an exclusive contract with the company and would be joining a five-member girl group. Gayoung had gained attention for her appearance on the Viewers' Tour episode of 1 Night 2 Days and had been cast in the drama series Poseidon alongside Top Class Entertainment operator and Shinhwa member Eric Mun. The series was set to air on the SBS network until production halted following the November 2010 Yeonpyeong bombardment incident. The roles were subsequently recast when production was greenlit by KBS a year later. Gayoung was later cast in the 2011 drama Spy Myung-wol along with Mun.\n\nThe final debut line-up of Stellar was Gayoung, true rookie Jeon-yul, and ex-Honeydew members Lee-seul and JoA. The group officially debuted on August 28, 2011, with the release of the digital single \"Rocket Girl\". On January 26, 2012, it was announced that Lee-seul and JoA were leaving the group and would be replaced by Min-hee and Hyo-eun for their first comeback track \"UFO\".\nOn July 11, 2013, Stellar released their third digital single \"Study\" which, and chart in the top 100 their first time.\nOn February 12, 2014, Stellar released their first extended play Marionette. The group received criticism for their \"stripping game\" promotion, which involved fans having to \"like\" posts on Stellar's official Facebook page to reveal photos of the members' body parts. The group received further criticism for their 19+ music video and performances of \"Marionette\". Despite the controversy, \"Marionette\" became their best selling single, peaking at number 35 and 34 on Gaon and Billboard K-Pop Hot 100 charts, respectively.\nOn August 21, 2014, Stellar released the digital single \"Mask\".\n\n\n=== 2015—2016: Breakthrough and identical sexual controversy ===\nOn March 9, 2015, Stellar released the digital single \"Fool\" and its music video.

While promoting \"Vibrato\", Stellar released a virtual reality clip of a July 27 performance.

On January 18, 2016, the album and a music video for the title track \"Sting\" were released. The band explained that their intentions for \"Sting\" were different from \"Marionette\" and \"Vibrato\", stating \"This time, we wanted to look more like a girlfriend rather than to [...] look provocative. We put on lighter makeup so that more fans will feel closer to us.\" The previously released single \"Vibrato\" was included as the final track on the album.\nStellar announced on April 1 that they would be holding their first solo concert, since their debut, on April 22, 2016, at Seoul's Yes24 MUVHALL.

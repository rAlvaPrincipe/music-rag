    "text": "My Education  is an American instrumental post-rock band from Austin, Texas. They create cinematic and psychedelic compositions blending intense droning guitars with melodic viola. The core of the band is two guitars, bass, drums, and viola, although they do play with violins, keyboards and vibes at times. They are currently on Golden Antenna Records, a label based in Hessen, Germany, who released the band's latest LP, A Drink for All My Friends, in March 2013.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince forming in 1999, the band's membership has expanded and contracted, and is currently a five-piece ensemble. My Education has released seven full-length albums, several singles, compilation appearances, and a 12\" vinyl collaboration with avant-hip hop duo Dälek. Their recordings have been remixed by members of the bands Kinski, Pelican, the Red Sparowes and Dälek.\nThe band has toured the United States many times including an east coast jaunt in April 2009 and a west coast tour in the summer of 2010. A 19-date European tour was completed in the spring of 2013.\nA remix of songs from the 2010 Sunrise release was issued in 2011, and a limited live “official bootleg” of the 2010 tour was issued in 2012. My Education has also collaborated with the Salt Lake City improvisational band Theta Naught, which has resulted in Sound Mass, an LP/CD release, as well as a string of festival appearances both in Utah and in Texas as live broadcasts, studio sessions and an as-yet-untitled second LP.  The band is currently working on both film and modern dance collaborations. In October 2022, the band released its ninth album, Emka, through Somewherecold Records.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe band's sound generally falls within the genre of instrumental post-rock. In an interview with the band, they state that their influences are “literally all over the map. The most important thing is to stake out your claim to whatever sliver of originality you can come up with, and pursue it with intensity, conviction, and rabid abandon.”\nIn My Education's live score to the F.W. Murnau classic silent film Sunrise, which has packed houses across the country and which was described by a critic as “one of the best movie-going experiences of my life. It knocked me out.”, “silver tones swirl from scene to scene until you almost forget it's a silent film. During the loudest part of the 96-minute set – a scene in which the Man and the Wife face gale force winds while crossing a lake – there's still a sense of restraint and elegance. It's the German way. The band, dressed in all black, lurks in the shadows.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nBrian Purington - Guitar\nChris Hackstie - Guitar\nJames Alexander - Viola\nScott Telles - Bass\nEarl Bowers - Drums\nKirk Laktas - Keyboards\nwith\nVincent Durcan - Percussion/Drums\nSarah Norris - Vibraphone\nSkye Ashbrook – Visuals/Design\nFormer members\n\nChristopher Stelly\nJoe Covington\nEric Gibbons\nRyan Nelson\nSean Seagler\n\n\n== Discography ==\nA Drink For All My Friends - LP/CD/digital  2013 (Haute Magie (USA)/Golden Antenna (Europe))\nSunrise Remixes – ltd.

Their first single, \"Let's Begin\", was briefly on MTV's rotation and featured in the film Not Another Teen Movie.  Their second single, \"1st Time\", was featured in the 2002 movie Orange County.  The band achieved little success in spite of their promotion with MTV.  The group formed in 1999 after working shows in New York City. The group was named after former Crazy Town member Brandon Calabro's dog Kal El Bad Ronald Santeria. The group wanted \"to form a band that combined rap, pop, rock, and sophomoric humor.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Band members ==\nDoug Ray MC\nWhite Owl MC\nKaz Gamble MC\nDJ Deetalx turntables\n\n\n== Single projects ==\nAfter the breakup of Bad Ronald, MC Doug Ray (also known as Toothpick) released an album in 2004 titled \"Time Travelin' Couch\".

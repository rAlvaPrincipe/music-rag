    "text": "The Savage Rose is a Danish psychedelic rock group, formed in 1967.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe band was founded in 1967 by Thomas Koppel, Anders Koppel, Alex Riel, Jens Rugsted, Flemming Ostermann, and singer Annisette Koppel. Ilse Marie Koppel was also participating. Nils Tuxen replaced Flemming Ostermann from their second album.\nSince the mid-1970s, the group was an acoustic trio consisting of Thomas Koppel, Annisette Koppel (then Hansen) and John Ravn as a core. From the beginning of the 1990s, the group returned to electric instrumentation. Thomas Koppel died on February 25, 2006.\nAfter the release of Love and Freedom in 2012, Savage Rose went on tour, but in Christmas 2013 they were back in the studio recording new songs and re-recording old songs. The album titled Roots of the Wasteland was released in April 2014; after 47 years and 21 studio albums, they are still going strong. The first single \"Mr. World\" was released April 12, 2014 and the new album was released May 19.\nIn 1996 The Savage Rose received a Danish Music Award for the album Black Angel, which was recorded in the US. The band's debut album, The Savage Rose, was chosen as part of the Danish Culture Canon in 2006.\nOn February 10, 2017, it was announced on their Facebook page that The Savage Rose will be releasing a new studio album as they tour to celebrate their 50-year anniversary.\nOn August 10, 2017, a new single \"Woman\" was released and the date for their new studio album Homeless was September 15, 2017.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote of the Savage Rose's 1970 LP Your Daily Gift: \"This band has a knack for combining funky riffs with persistent melodies (borrowed from where, this ignorant American wonders). But though Annisette's multi-octave Lolita voice is certainly distinctive, I find her about as sexy as Yma Sumac, and as long as she sings Anders Koppel's lyrics she won't be any font of wisdom either.\" He appreciated the \"fast tempos, soul piano,\" and production of their Jimmy Miller-produced Refugee (1971) more, saying they \"do wonders for Anisette's come-on, and the lyrics prove that getting laid is a universal language. Death, too.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\n\n\n==== Live albums ====\n\n\n==== Compilation albums ====\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Guest appearances ==\n1969  Newport Jazz Festival \n1974 Ragnarock'73 (The shoeshine boy is dead) \"Ragnarock was a Rockfestival in Norway '73, '74 and '75 and released one LP\"\n1976 Christiania (De vilde blomster gror)\n1976 Christiania (I kan ikke sl√• os ihjel) \"Recorded by Bifrost with Annisette, Poul Dissing and Sebastian on Vocals\"\n2004 Bevar Christiania (Junglebarn)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nThe Savage Rose on Facebook\nSavage Rose at IMDb\nThe Savage Rose in the film database danskefilm.dk (in Danish)"

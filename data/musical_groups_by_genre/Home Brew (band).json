    "text": "Home Brew, also known as Home Brew Crew, is a New Zealand hip hop group.\nThey released their self-titled debut full-length album in May 2012 to some critical acclaim. It hit number 1 on the New Zealand album charts in its first week, and is the first New Zealand hip hop album to top the charts since Scribe's album The Crusader in 2003.\nIn 2010 Home Brew were shortlisted for the New Zealand Music Awards Critics Choice Prize. In 2012 they won Best Urban / Hip Hop Album at the New Zealand Music Awards and were nominated for four others, including Best Group and Album of the Year.\nOne of their promotional videos, 'Police Stop Seven', has been criticised for condoning drunk-driving. In 2010 they also played at the Big Day Out.\n\nIn 2012, Massive Magazine wrote:Their fun and often satirical take on hip-hop is no less pure or cultured because of that, and the well-rehearsed flows and crafted beats are the result of hours of hard work. This fact also makes them an impressive live outfit, and this reputation has seen them steadily become more in demand throughout New Zealand.In 2014, one of the band's performances at Lincoln University in Christchurch was shut down after one of its members allegedly punched an audience member in the face.\nIn 2023, Home Brew released an 11th-anniversary re-issue of their self-titled debut on vinyl and CD. On 27 October 2023, Home Brew announced their sophomore album, Run It Back. It was subsequently released on 8 December 2023.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome Brew Crew's website\nHome Brew on Bandcamp"

    "text": "Monk & Canatella is an indie/breakbeat musical group from Bristol, England, formed by Simon Russell (born in 1973) and Jim Johnston (born 1975) in the mid-nineties. Their 1996 album on Cup of Tea Records, Care in the Community, is a prime example of the trip hop sound.\nThe band later moved to Telstar and released a second album, Do Community Service in 2000. The artwork for this album was an early collaboration with the Bristol born graffiti artist Banksy. The band parted company with the label shortly afterwards.\nTheir song \"Trout\" appears on the original soundtrack for the 1996 film The Island of Dr. Moreau, starring Marlon Brando although the track is never heard in the actual film itself.\nThe band released the single \"Straighthead\" on YouTube on 23 December 2007.\nThe English trip hop band Portishead included a track titled \"A Tribute to Monk and Canatella\" on their 1994 CD single \"Numb\", a year before Monk & Canatella's first release.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums:\n\nCare in the Community - Cup of Tea Records (1996)\nDo Community Service - Telstar Records (2000)\nEPs and Singles:\n\nFly Fishing EP - Cup of Tea Records (1995)\n I Can Water My Plants - Cup of Tea Records (1996)\nWho's Who EP - Cup of Tea Records (1997)\nSon 4.5.98 - Telstar Records (1998)\nEnter the Monk EP - Telstar Records (1999)\nSlagger - Telstar Records (2000)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Monk & Canatella website\nmonkandcanatella's YouTube channel"

    "text": "Unravelled Broken Orchestra was an avant garde ensemble based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. With a core of regular players (Christopher Friesen, Terence Fuller, Jaret McNabb, Fletcher Pratt, Robert Turnbull) and an open-door policy to others, they create soundscapes that were equally inspired by Miles Davis and Sonic Youth. Their debut cd Centre of the Universe in Reverse was independently released late 2005.\nIn 2009, they changed their name to Broken Orchestra of Winnipeg. In 2012, Friesen and McNabb changed their name to Seafreezing and digitally released the album This is Not a Guarantee, It's a Possibility. They continued to post songs to 2017.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDeath Fog, 2005.\nGone / The Unravelled Broken Orchestra (split with Gone), 2005.\n\n\n== Ensemble Members ==\nJoshua Ayers - drums (also Filament, Funk Dubois, Pope's Daughter).\nCorey Biluk - drums (also The Paperbacks)\nDarcy Bunio - guitar (also Head Hits Concrete).\nAlexander Campbell - didgeridoo (also Funk Dubois).\nKevin Chubey - spoken word.\nRobert Dickson - electronics (also Nagasaki).\nBreanna Duffill - percussion.\nBrendon Ehinger - keyboard.\nDave Forte - percussion (also Absent Sound).\nChristopher Friesen - bass, keyboard, percussion, drums, vocals, saxophone, balloon.\nTerence Fuller - bass, drum machine, found percussion, balloon, 4-track (also Gone).\nEric Gallipo - guitar, keyboard, trumpet.\nDoreen Girard - cello.\nJoshua Granowski - stand-up bass.\nChris Hepola - drums.\nLuke Heiken - guitar, gadgets, keyboards, bass, drum\nD'alton Hindle - guitar, trombone, gadgets.\nCameron Johnson - gadgets, found percussion, sampler, mixer, balloon (also This Camera is Red).\nSam Koulack - drums, guitar, found percussion, balloon.\nIan La Rue - guitar.

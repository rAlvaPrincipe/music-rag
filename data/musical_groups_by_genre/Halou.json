    "text": "Halou is a band from San Francisco, California.\n\n\n== History ==\nRyan and Rebecca met in 1992 as the drummer and vocalist for the Santa Cruz-based band Anomie. That group would change Ryan's musical focus from techno pop (as the main keyboardist of Thinner) to more ambient guitar work, and transform Rebecca from a riot girl enthusiast into someone more at home with 4AD. Anomie's shoegaze sound met with rapid success in Santa Cruz on the strength of their album Burgundy Girl. The band later moved to San Francisco before the group split into two bands.  In late 1995 Ryan and Rebecca's half formed \"anymore\" (as in: \"We're not Anomie anymore.\") and released two CDs.\nAfter \"anymore\" dissolved, they became Halou. Ryan has cited influences including Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Wire and the Tom Tom Club. The band released their debut album, We Only Love You in 1998, on a small, independent label called Bedazzled. We Only Love You was followed by a compilation of non-album tracks entitled Sans Soucie in 1999. Their second album, Wiser, was released by Nettwerk in 2001, while the more recent, Wholeness & Separation and Halou, were released by Vertebrae in 2006 and 2008 respectively.\nHalou's first album was broadcast on influential independent radio stations in Seattle and Los Angeles. In recent years, the band has received coverage from notable news sources, and they have been recognized for their production talents:\n\n\"Halou's remix of Rod Stewart's \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy\" hit number one on the Billboard club chart, and they have been solicited for soundtrack work, already appearing on two feature films.\"\nIn 2008, Halou announced that they would no longer be making music under the moniker, and the three part collaboration was over.  Rebecca and Ryan Coseboom continue to perform together under the name Stripmall Architecture. Count continues to be involved in music as a producer and engineer, and is a member of a band called inu. In late 2015 Halou went back into the studio to record, releasing the track Stillbreathing on November 2, 2015.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nNettwerk's website\nYour Friends Music Video on Eithiriel\nHalou's Wholeness & Separation album review at allmusic.com"

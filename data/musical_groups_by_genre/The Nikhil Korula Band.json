    "text": "The Nikhil Korula Band is an American jam band based in California, known for blending genres as diverse as jazz, world music, and adult contemporary. Also called The NK Band, the original lineup has changed somewhat since the band was founded in 2002, and currently consists of Nikhil Korula, Ray Bergstrom, Matt Spencer, Adam Gust, Zane Musa, Marcus Milius, Chris Lovejoy, and Will Herrington. With a sound described by Relix Magazine as \"part Dave Matthews guitar licks and sax solos alongside world-music beats,\" the band has performed at festivals such as Bonnaroo, the Playboy Jazz Festival, SXSW, and Summerfest. They have also headlined venues such as House of Blues and the Viper Room, as well as numerous college campuses, and have opened for Jason Mraz, John Mayer, The Roots, Erykah Badu, and Rusted Root, among others.\nTheir music has been featured on the soundtracks of TV shows such as Greek, Burn Notice, The Real World, and Guiding Light, and in 2014 the music video for their song \"Fade Away\" won Best Music Video Film at Indie Fest in Southern California, as well as several other film festivals that include Alaska Film Fest, Studio City Film Festival, and Yosemite Film Festival.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2002–04: Founding, The Way Things Work ===\nThe founding member of the NK Band, Nikhil Korula, first started performing as a solo artist in 2002 around Los Angeles. Largely performing acoustic music with a guitar, early on he collaborated with jazz musicians around the city, teaming up with guitarist Anthony King in 2002 as an acoustic duo at open mics, coffeehouses, and music venues. Saxophonist Dan Boissy and harmonica player Marcus Milius joined in 2002. Once a regular lineup was established the group was founded in 2002, blending calypso, rock, reggae, African and Latin sounds. Their first gig as a sextet was a sold out show at the Knitting Factory on July 25, 2002.\nTheir debut release, The Freedom EP, was released in 2003 on Groove Infinity Records. The EP led to the band recording a full-length album at Ocean Way Studios in Hollywood. Titled The Way Things Work, the LP came out in 2004. In response, Relix Magazine wrote that Korula's music mixes \"part Dave Matthews guitar licks and sax solos alongside world-music beats...Korula’s new album, The Way Things Work, displays the six-piece’s own western/tribal dichotomy.\"\n\n\n=== 2005–12: Touring and live album ===\nTouring intermittently, the NK Band performed at the House of Blues in December 2006 with a lineup consisting of Korula, Anthony King, Leo Nobre, Dan Boissy, Adam Gust and Jack Lees. They were described as a buzz band by Kevin Bronson of the Los Angeles Times in 2006, who wrote that \"think of the Nikhil Korula Band as the rainbow snow cone of the local rock scene: plenty of flavors, all adding up to something cool and sweet. Afro-beats, Latin grooves, calypso, jazz.\"\nTheir EP Acoustic B-Sides & Rarities came out in 2007, and that September they opened for the Dave Matthews Band. They have also performed at festivals such as Summerfest from 2007 to 2014, including opening Summerfest for O.A.R. in June 2007, Bonnaroo in 2008 and 2009, Sunset Junction Street Fair, JazzReggae Festival @ UCLA, and SXSW. Beyond headlining over twenty shows at the House of Blues, they have also headlined venues such as The Mint, The Roxy on the Sunset Strip, Temple Bar, the Viper Room,  the Apollo Theater on April 4, 2010, and numerous college campuses.  The band headlined at the Playboy Jazz Festival’s Community Concert in June 2011, with co-headliners including drummer Ndugu Chancler and guitarist Doc Powell.\nThe NK Band's 2010 double album Live Vibes captures their live performances, and includes twenty original songs performed in front of the band's hometown audience. The band's track \"Stay For A While\" was included on Greek (ABC Family) episode \"I Know What You Did Last Semester,\" which aired January 2010.\n\n\n=== 2012–13: Music of the New Day and Solo Sessions ===\nReleased in 2012, the NK Band's studio album Music of the New Day  consisted of all original tracks, excluding a Bo Diddly cover of \"Before You Accuse Me.\" As of late 2012 the band was receiving radio airplay on 45 stations in 25 states, as well as in counties such as India, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. \"A Song For L.A.\" from the album has also been featured at home games for teams such as the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers, and Los Angeles Kings. The Scoop LA wrote on October 24, 2012, that \"A standing room only crowd turned out last night for The Nikhil Korula Band at The House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. In another stellar performance, Korula and his band knocked it out of the park with a 3-hour concert featuring music from their latest album Music of the New Day and classic hits by such iconic artists as Stevie Wonder and Eric Clapton.\" In early 2013 the band continued to tour, and it was at Summerfest that the band also opened for Gavin DeGraw on June 26, 2013, performing an audience of over 10,000 people. The band also performed at the 2013 Sundance festival as part of the \"Concerts at Sundance\" music series.\n\nIn 2013 Korula recorded Solo Sessions, collaborating with members of the NK Band and two members of the Dave Matthew Band, Jeff Coffin (saxophone) and Butch Taylor (keyboards). All songs on the EP are original. Officially released on July 9, 2013, that day the band also held a release party while headlining the House of Blues Sunset Strip. Stephen K. Peeples of House Blend commented that the EP's \"music is soulful and adventurous, drawing from multicultural roots, and translates easily from solo to the full band arrangements fans will [see live].\" The lead single from the EP, \"Fade Away,\" was released prior to the EP, and as of July 7, 2013, was inside the To 20 on FMQB's Hot A/C airplay chart, after initially debuting at No. 106. It peaked at No. 10 on the AC Radio Chart (also titled MQB's 'Friday Morning Quarterback Inc.' Hot Adult Contemporary Radio chart).\n\n\n=== 2014–present ===\nSolo Sessions was followed by the full-length studio album A Decade in the Sun, recorded by Korula as an acoustic solo album at Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee. The band toured in support of the album. In 2014, the music video for \"Fade Away\" won Best Music Video Film at Indie Fest in Southern California. The music video, directed by Jethro Rothe-Kushel, was also an official selection for the NYC Independent Film Festival in 2014. As of late 2014, the video had won five film award for best music video, including film festivals such as the Yosemite Film Festival, Alaska Film Festival, and Studio City Film Festival.\n\n\n== Style ==\nThe NK Band frequently incorporates improvisation into their live shows.

    "text": "Hollow Coves is an independent band from Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The band consists of two members, Ryan Henderson and Matt Carins, who sing and play guitar in folk style.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe pair recorded music in a garage that was uploaded just before they parted ways to Canada and England. The music became popular on Spotify in a very short amount of time which resulted in immediate fame and record deals. They decided to stay where they were living, but recorded and wrote songs long distance using online resources.\nOfficially formed in 2013, they released their first EP \"Drifting\" in October 2014 and now both reside in Queensland.\nIn January 2024, the group announced the forthcoming release of their second studio album Nothing to Lose. It was produced by Matt Corby.\n\n\n== Members ==\nRyan Henderson grew up without a musical background. When he was in high school, his friends took him to the Woodford Folk Festival to see the Folk and Indie pop group \"Angus & Julia Stone.\" This music inspired him to learn the guitar and eventually to his career.\nMatt Carins grew up in Brisbane surrounded by music. His father is in a local cover band and has written albums. His mother plays and teaches piano and flute. He also has a sister who plays the piano and a brother who is in an alternative rock band.\nCarins has stated in the past that he was a carpenter and during the COVID-19 pandemic, he and Henderson built a production studio and soundproof \"room\" to practice and record their music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== Gold Coast Music Awards ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSpotify"

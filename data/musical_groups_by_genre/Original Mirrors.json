    "text": "Original Mirrors were a British new wave band formed in Liverpool in 1979. Featuring members of several earlier punk/new wave bands, they signed to Mercury Records and released two albums before splitting in 1981, with members going on to play in the Lightning Seeds and Status Quo.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band were formed in 1979 by songwriters Ian Broudie (formerly of Big in Japan and Secrets) and Steve Allen (formerly of Deaf School). They recruited former XTC and Stadium Dogs keyboardist/guitarist Jonathan Perkins, Phil Spalding, formerly bassist with Bernie Torm√©, and drummer Pete Kircher.\nThey were signed by Mercury Records and their first release was the single \"Could This Be Heaven\" in November 1979. A second single, \"Boys Cry\", preceded a self-titled debut album in February 1980. Jimmy Hughes replaced Spalding prior to the band's second album, Heart-twango & Raw-beat (1981). A final single, \"20,000 Dreamers\", followed before the band split up.\nSpalding left to join Toyah then later GTR and Mike Oldfield's band.

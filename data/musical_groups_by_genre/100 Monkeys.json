    "text": "100 Monkeys was an independent funk rock band from Los Angeles, California. The members of the group, from 2008 until their disbandment in 2012, were Ben Graupner, Jackson Rathbone, Jerad Anderson, Ben Johnson, and Lawrence Abrams. The band name comes from the idea of the \"hundredth monkey effect\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group came together in 2008 in Los Angeles, California, playing small shows at the 24K Lounge and other places in Los Angeles. Their first album, Monster De Lux, was entirely improvised and was done in one long take. Their second self-released album, Creative Control Sessions, featured popular songs \"Sleeping Giants\" and \"Gus\" and was produced by Scott Coslett. During a small tour from May through June 2009, the band played dates in PA and NY and in June released three singles of studio mastered songs â€“ \"Ugly Girl\", \"Smoke\" and \"Wasteland Too\". Their first studio album, \"Grape\" was released in 2009. The band then toured the West Coast. In 2010, the band embarked on a 100 City Tour across the United States, an effort which has greatly increased their audience.\nThe band's sound has been described as funk rock by Spin.  They have described the meaning behind their lyrics to be inspired by \"drinking, the devil, death and women who cheat and steal.\" Due to their recent fame the group has been interviewed by various music magazines and television networks. Their music is said to have a blues like feel, and their performances give off a '60s-like vibe, mimicking bands such as the Beatles. Their sound has also been described by MTV.com as a blend of \"Iggy Pop with the Raconteurs.\"\nIn 2010 the band also released Live And Kickin: Part Too, a documentary companion to their Live And Kickin: Part One live album.\nThe band signed with Warrior Records in 2011 and released their second studio album June 28, 2011, entitled Liquid Zoo. They will embark on a summer tour spanning all of North America and parts of Canada. The tour will be supported by Vancouver band The Bleeding Horse Express which has a forthcoming album produced by Rathbone. The Tour kicked off with an album release party in Cincinnati, Ohio, and will wrap up exactly two months later in San Diego, CA.\nOn March 4, 2012 100 Monkeys announced that Jackson Rathbone and Jerad Anderson would be taking a leave from the band. Anderson stated that he hoped to return eventually after working on some film projects for his company Wayne/Lauren Film Company, but Rathbone was suspected to be permanently replaced after the announcement of his girlfriend's pregnancy. \n100 Monkeys toured the west coast during April 2012 in support for their new single, \"City Of Bones\", which debuted March 12, 2012.\nOn April 13, 2012, fans were told to click a link from 100 Monkeys Twitter account that led them to the information that former bandmate Jackson Rathbone and his lawyers had informed the band that the name \"100 Monkeys\" can no longer be used by remaining band members.

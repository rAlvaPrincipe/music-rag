    "text": "The Headboys were a Scottish power pop band, formed in 1977 in Edinburgh, originally under the name of Badger.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe band is best known for its single \"The Shape of Things to Come\", which entered the UK Singles Chart on 22 September 1979. The track spent eight weeks on the chart, reaching number 45. This secured the band an appearance on Top of the Pops on 11 October 1979; the debut show for host Andy Peebles.\nThe group released an album in 1979 on Robert Stigwood's RSO label, which was produced by Peter Ker (who also worked with the Motors, and Bram Tchaikovsky).\nThe lack of any other UK chart hit left them labelled as one-hit wonders.\nIn 2013, the band announced on their Facebook page that the ten tracks they had recorded for a follow-up album, but which remained unreleased, would be issued on CD under the title The Lost Album by the American record label, Pop Detective Records. The album, issued on 1 December that year, was dedicated to the memory of drummer Davy Ross, who died in November 2010. George Boyter died in September 2022.  Bob Heatlie died on 8 April 2023, at the age of 76. Lou Lewis died in June 2024. Calum Malcolm now remains as the only living ex-member of the group.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nLou Lewis — guitar and vocals\nGeorge Boyter — bass and vocals\nCalum Malcolm — keyboards and vocals\nDavy Ross — drums and vocals\nBob Heatlie — keyboards, sax, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Headboys (1979), US number 113 Canada number 69  AUS number 43\nThe Lost Album (2013)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nVideo Concert Hall\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBand biography\nLyrics for \"The Shape of Things to Come\""

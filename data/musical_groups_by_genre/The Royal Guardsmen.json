    "text": "The Royal Guardsmen are an American rock band best known for their 1966 hit singles \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\", \"The Return of The Red Baron\", \"Snoopy For President\", and the Christmas follow-up \"Snoopy's Christmas\".\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally known as the Posmen, the Ocala, Florida-based sextet adopted their anglophile moniker during the British Invasion, led by The Beatles and other British artists. The group was originally composed of Bill Balough (bass), John Burdett (drums), Chris Nunley (vocals), Tom Richards (guitar), Billy Taylor (organ), and Barry Winslow (lead vocals/guitar). The band was managed by Leonard Stogel and Associates.\nAlthough the Guardsmen's first single, \"Baby Let's Wait\", failed to reach national success, this tune reached a position of no lower than #11 according to November 12, 1966, WYND hit parade. The group's second offering, \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\", reached #2 in the Billboard Hot 100 and spent one week at #1 in the Record World charts, remained in the bestsellers for 12 weeks, and was certified gold by the RIAA in February 1967.\nSince the band did not ask Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz for permission, the Canadian arm of Laurie Records refused to issue the single until the legal problems were ironed out: instead, the band recorded the thinly-disguised \"Squeaky vs. the Black Knight\", which was released in Canada and became a hit on at least one Canadian station. Eventually, Schulz gave his okay, and \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\" was released in Canada.\nImmediately the song became a hit, the band went on a national tour during Christmas school break, playing in New York, San Francisco, and other large cities and sharing billing with the Beach Boys, Jefferson Airplane, Paul Revere & the Raiders, The Turtles, The Who, and The Monkees. That summer, they toured as the opening act for Tommy James & the Shondells and Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs.\nSnoopy, the Red Baron, and aircraft became recurring themes in their music, though they did have the top 100 singles \"Any Wednesday\", \"I Say Love\", and (at #35) \"Baby Let's Wait\", a re-release of their first single. Still, some members felt typecast as the Snoopy band and the original group split up in 1970, although a band with some replacement players continued for another year. \nIn 1976, the original members (except for organist Taylor) got back together and played club dates for another three years before disbanding again. Guitarist Richards died later that year at age 30 of a brain tumor. The band (including Taylor, with local guitarist Pat Waddell substituting for Richards) next reunited for a live show on October 2, 2004, at the 50th reunion of their high school marching band, after which the band played a few other shows in 2005. They performed together in 2010; their next live performance after that was 2018.\nIn December 2006, they released a new Snoopy song, \"Snoopy vs. Osama\", and in 2011, the single \"Alive and Well\".\nIn The Crossfire Band of Ocala, original members Chris Nunley and Bill Balough and replacement member Pat Waddell continued playing together at least into 2021.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSnoopy vs. the Red Baron (1966) #44\nReturn of the Red Baron (1967)\nSnoopy and His Friends (1967) #46\nAlso on Billboard's Christmas Album chart at #6 in 1967 and #19 in 1968\nSnoopy for President (1968, re-released 1976) #189 in 1968, in 1976\nMerry Snoopy's Christmas (1978, 1980, 1982, 1984)\nAnthology (CD, April 1995)\nBest of the Royal Guardsmen (CD, May 1998)\nSnoopy vs. the Red Baron / Snoopy and His Friends (CD re-release, June 2001)\nReturn of the Red Baron / Snoopy for President (CD re-release, June 2001)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\nA ^ Charted 3 times in the US – 1967, 1968, and 1969 reaching #1, #15, and #11 respectively but only on Billboard's \"Best Bets For Christmas\" chart.\nB ^ Original version contains intro mentioning real 1968 candidates; 1972 and 1976 re-issues omit this.\nC ^ Only the 'B' side \"Biplane Evermore\" charted in Australia.

    "text": "Candy Claws is an American dream pop group formed in Fort Collins, Colorado in 2007. It consists of founding members Ryan Hover, Karen Hover and Hank Bertholf. They disbanded in 2015, soon after the release of Ceres & Calypso in the Deep Time, which over time has proved to be their most popular and lasting work. They reunited in 2023 and released their first new music in a decade called \"Distortion Spear\". Although released as part of the 10-year anniversary of Ceres & Calypso in the Deep Time, it is a new recording by the band.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 2007 by Ryan Hover, Karen Hover (née McCormick) and Hank Bertholf. The members shared interests in \"electronics, droning shoegaze rock, and classic psychedelic pop\", as well as lyrics informed by their love of natural history.\nIn 2009, the band released their debut album,  In the Dream of the Sea Life, which was inspired by Rachel Carson's book The Sea Around Us. Originally released by Wave Magic label, it was re-released by Irish independent label Indiecater Records and earned enthusiastic reviews from the international music press. In 2010, the Twosyllable Records released the band's follow-up album, Hidden Lands, which was inspired by Richard M. Ketchum's The Secret Life of the Forest. During this time, Candy Claws also assembled an expanded eight-piece touring band for live performances. The band's third album, Ceres & Calypso in the Deep Time, was released in 2013.\nIn 2014, Ryan and Karen formed a new band, Sound of Ceres, featuring the members of The Apples in Stereo and The Drums.

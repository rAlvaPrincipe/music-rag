    "text": "Kyoto Jazz Massive is a Japanese musical project specialising in crossover jazz and electronic styles. The group was formed in 1992 and consists of brothers Shuya and Yoshihiro Okino. They have also included Hajime Yoshizawa, a piano producer, on a number of works. Although the brothers DJed in the late 1980s and were remixing and composing as far back as the early 1990s, they were largely popularised by the British Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson around 2001.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBrothers Shuya and Yoshihiro Okino, both DJs and remixers in Kyoto, formed the project in 1994. They released their debut, self-titled album, the same year.\nIn 2015, to celebrate their 20-year anniversary, the duo put together a full jazz band, titled Kyoto Jazz Sextet. Their debut album, Mission, came out the same year.\nShuya Okino also runs a music venue in Shibuya, Tokyo, called the Room.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Kyoto Jazz Massive ===\nStudio albums\n\nKyoto Jazz Massive (1994)\nSpirit of the Sun (2002)\nMessage from a New Dawn (2021)\nEPs\n\nEclipse / Silent Messenger (2000)\nKyoto Jazz Massive (2001)\nSubstream (2001)\nMind Expansions (Maxi single, 2002)\nCompilations\n\nSpellbinder – Compiled by Kyoto Jazz Massive (1992)\nFueled for the Future – Mixed by Kyoto Jazz Massive (2000)\nCrossbreed – A Collection of Futuristic Fusion (2000)\nCrossbreed 2 – A Collection of Futuristic Fusion (2001)\nShibuya Jazz Classics by Kyoto Jazz Massive (2002)\nRe KJM (2004)\nFor KJM (2004)\nBy KJM (2005)\n10th Anniversary (2006)\nEssence of Especial (2006)\nQuiet Wave (2006)\nSo Especial (2009)\nUrbanrhythm (2012)\nAbstract Jazz Journey (2013)\nKJM Plays – Contemporary Classics (2014)\nKJM Works – Remixes & Re-edits (2014)\n\n\n=== Kyoto Jazz Sextet ===\nMission (2015)\nUnity (2017)\nSuccession (2022)\n\n\n== See also ==\nJapanese jazz\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nShuya Okino blog\nThe Room official website\nKyoto Jazz Massive discography at Discogs"

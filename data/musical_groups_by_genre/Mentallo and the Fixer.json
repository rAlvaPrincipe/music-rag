    "text": "Mentallo and the Fixer (sometimes written as Mentallo & the Fixer) is the project name used by Texan electro-industrial musicians Gary Dassing (Mentallo) and Dwayne Dassing (The Fixer) from 1988 to 1999, and by Gary Dassing alone from 1999 to the present day.  The band has several releases on the American record label, Metropolis Records. They are named after two Marvel Comics characters.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe Dassing brothers first began experimenting with music by the means of more traditional rock music instruments, such as guitar and drums. However, by the time the two formed their first band Benestrophe with vocalist Richard Mendez, the instruments of choice became synthesizers and samplers. Most of the two tapes worth of material they recorded subsequently became available as the releases Sensory Deprivation and Auric Fires on Ras Dva Records. \nAfter parting ways with Mendez, the two brothers began work as Mentallo & The Fixer. A friend of Gary's brought the name \"Mentallo & The Fixer\" to his attention while still working on Benestrophe. After Benestrophe went dormant, the name resurfaced and, after Gary realized the names referred to two lesser-known comic book characters, the name grew on him.\nTheir first album release No Rest for the Wicked saw a limited 500-copy run on vinyl and a CD by the Portuguese label Simbiose records, and also gained the attention of Talla 2XLC from Zoth Ommog records. Zoth Ommog released their next two major albums, Revelations 23 and Where Angels Fear to Tread. As an American band, working with European labels proved difficult and frustrating due to poor communications and, in the case of the Simbiose releases, a lack of a formal contract.\nMentallo & The Fixer soon after began their long-term relationship with the American industrial music record label Metropolis Records with a domestic re-release of their second and third albums as well as a CD of unreleased back catalog material, Continuum.\nMeanwhile, in 1994, the Dassing brothers formed a side project with vocalist Michael Greene called Mainesthai. Mainesthai's two releases, Out to Lunch and Mentallo & The Fixer Meets Mainesthai were also both released on Metropolis Records, but not until 1998. Michael also participated in Mentallo's first U.S. tour in 1996, joining the band to perform Mainesthai tracks during their live sets.\nIn 1997 Mentallo & The Fixer toured the U.S. for the second time, Europe for the first time, and released their next album Burnt Beyond Recognition, along with two EPs, Centuries and False Prophets. The band's second US tour was initially cut short due to difficulties because of the long duration and because show revenue was unexpectedly low, but the missed tour dates were rescheduled after a break. The European tour in October that year proved to be a much better experience for the band.\nBy 1999, Dwayne and Gary agreed to split in order to pursue their own musical directions. After the departure of Dwayne from the band (aside from some live show support through 2002), Gary continued to use the Mentallo & The Fixer name and released several albums including Algorythum, Love Is the Law, Return to Grimpen Ward, and Vengeance is Mine, along with the EP Systematik Ruin to accompany Alogrythum.\nAfter \"Grimpen\", Mentallo's album output slowed somewhat, resulting in two albums: Enlightenment Through a Chemical Catalyst in 2007, and Music From the Eather in 2012, both released by Alfa Matrix.\nIn September 2014, Mentallo & the Fixer released a 3 CD box titled Zothera on Alfa Matrix. It contained two remastered albums from their Zoth Ommog era, namely Revelations 23 and Where Angels Fear to Tread, and a third bonus CD Apocrypha with unreleased material including remixes.\nAnother intervening period of dormancy followed, compelled by the crash of Gary's music computer, which he took as a sign to give music a break for a while. After a several year break and a new Apple computer, Gary found the motivation to revive works in progress from data backups and record a new album, Arrange The Molecule, released by Alfa Matrix in 2017.\nUpdates posted to the band's official Facebook page in 2019 showed Gary in the studio, joined by brother Dwayne and occasional collaborator Jon (Jonni) Pyre, working on new material for an as yet unnamed project. The apparent inspiration for this live performance-only project is Tangerine Dream's first live recording from 1975, Ricochet.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Main discography ===\nStudio albums\n\n.5 Honkey/Wreckage + Ruin + & + Regrets + (Redemption) (1991, GPC Productions)\nNo Rest for the Wicked (1992, Simbiose)\nRevelations 23 (1993, Zoth Ommog)\nWhere Angels Fear to Tread (1994, Zoth Ommog)\nBurnt Beyond Recognition (1997, Metropolis)\nAlgorythum (1999, Metropolis)\nLove Is the Law (2000, Metropolis)\nVengeance Is Mine (2001, Metropolis)\nEnlightenment Through a Chemical Catalyst (2007, Metropolis)\nMusic From the Eather (2012, Alfa Matrix)\nArrange the Molecule (2017, Alfa Matrix)\nRemix albums\n\nMentallo & The Fixer Meets Mainesthai (1994, Zoth Ommog)\nContinuum (1995, Metropolis)\nReturn to Grimpen Ward (2001, Metropolis)\nExtended plays\n\nCenturies (1997, Metropolis)\nFalse Prophets (1997, Metropolis)\nSystematik Ruin (1999, Metropolis)\nCommandments for the Molecular Age (2006, Alfa Matrix)\n4.4U (2012.11) (2012, Alfa Matrix)\nCompilation albums\n\n...There's No Air to Breathe (1997, Zoth Ommog)\nA Collection of Rare, Unreleased & Remastered (2012, Alfa Matrix)\nZothera (2014, Alfa Matrix)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nCybernetic Biodread Transmission – LP side B track #1/CD track #5 \"Brutal Rapture\" (1992) Simbiose\nThe Cyberflesh Conspiracy – CD track #2 (1992) If It Moves...\nWe Came To Dance - Indie Dancefloor Vol. II\" – CD track #11 \"Decomposed\" (1993) Sub Terranean\nZoth in Your Mind – CD track #1 \"Sacrilege (Angel of Death Mix)\" (1993) Zoth Ommog\nMoonraker – 2xCD disc #1 track #3 \"Grim Reality\" (1994) Sub Terranean\nThe Colours of Zoth Ommog – CD track #2 \"Grim Reality (Grimpen Ward Remix)\" (1994) Zoth Ommog\nTotentanz - The Best of Zoth Ommog – 2xCD disc #2 track #1 \"Sacrilege (Angel of Death Mix)\" and track #2 \"Rapid Suffocation\" (1994) Zoth Ommog\nWe Came to Dance Vol. V – CD track #6 \"Legion of Lepers (Grimpen Ward Remix)\" (1994) Sub Terranean\nElectricity Vol. 6 – CD track #4 \"Battered States of Euphoria\" (1995) Ausfahrt\nMoonraker Vol. II – 2xCD disc #2 track #3 \"Sacrilege (Grimpen Ward Mix)\" (1995) Sub Terranean\nThe Tyranny Off the Beat Vol. II – CD track #11 \"Murderers Among Us (B.K.

Their first song - \"Pig Butcher\" - was recorded in the Summer of 1988. Gary and Dwayne composed the music and Rich wrote the lyrics and provided vocals. Benestrophe went idle in 1990 as the Dassing brothers moved to Austin, TX, but reactivated for a time after 1995 with new material and re-releases on RAS DVA records.\n\nSensory Deprivation – Cassette, Self-released\nRed Kross – Cassette (1990) Self-released\nSensory Deprivation – CD Ltd.

Gary answered an ad that Mike had put in a local paper which led to an interview and one-song demo performance that led to a formal collaboration. As was the case with Benestrophe, Gary and Dwayne produced the music and Mike contributed the lyrics and vocals. Mainesthai's sound was similar to Mentallo, but the subject matter was explicitly more political in nature and the music was made with an effort to sound more melodic and, in their words, \"tribal\".\n\nOut to Lunch - CD (1994) Zoth Ommog Records\nMentallo & The Fixer Meets Mainesthai – CD (1994) Zoth Ommog Records • CD (1998) Metropolis Records\nBody Rapture Vol. 4 – V/A CD track #2 \"Dollars and Sins\" (1994) Zoth Ommog Records\nWe Came to Dance - Indie Dancefloor Vol. VI – V/A CD track #10 \"Exit (Stage Left)\" (1994) Sub Terranean\nThere Is No Time – V/A 4xCD disc #2 track #9 \"Y (Mama's Crazy Kitchen Mix)\" (1995) Ras Dva\n\n\n=== Parking Lot in Drug Form ===\nThis is a Gary Dassing and Ric Laciak project recorded while Ric stayed with Gary during a two-week visit to Austin, TX.\n\nThere Is No Time – V/A 4xCD disc #4 track #15 \"Step Away\" (1995) Ras Dva\nAP: The Contest – V/A CD track #14 \"So Cold\" (1995) Zoth Ommog Records\n\n\n=== Shimri ===\nGary Dassing solo project.\n\nLilies of the Field – CD (2000) Artoffact Records\n\n\n=== Reign of Roses ===\nDwayne Dassing with vocals and lyrics by Scott Berens Drum programming on some tracks by Gary Dassing\n\nIn Bourbon and in Blood – CDr (2006) Self-released\n\n\n=== Kitty Kosmonaut ===\nDwayne Dassing with John Bustamante of Fektion Fekler\n\nKitty Kosmonaut - CD, Digital (2015) Re:Mission Entertainment\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMentallo & The Fixer's Metropolis Records Page\nMentallo & The Fixer on Bandcamp\nMentallo & The Fixer on Facebook\nMentallo & The Fixer discography at Discogs \nMentallo & The Fixer discography at MusicBrainz"

    "text": "Untitled (stylized as 「untitled」) is the sixteenth studio album by the Japanese idol group Arashi. The album was released on October 18, 2017 under their record label J Storm in two editions: a first press/limited edition and a regular edition. With more than 750,000 copies sold, the album was certified Triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). It was released digitally on February 7, 2020.\n\n\n== Album information ==\nThe album was purposely titled to suggest that it is \"unfinished\". Besides a CD of 13 tracks, the first-run limited edition also contains a DVD of the music video and making-of for the album's lead song \"Mikan\" and 80-page lyrics photo booklet with special packaging. The regular edition also includes 4 unit songs, a bonus track, and a 36-page lyrics booklet.\n\n\n=== Songs ===\nUntitled includes three of the group's previously released singles: \"Power of the Paradise\", \"I'll Be There\", and \"Tsunagu\".\n\"Power of the Paradise\" was used as the theme song for NTV's news coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics, where Sho Sakurai served as the main newscaster. \"I'll Be There\" was used as the theme song for the television drama Kizoku Tantei starring Masaki Aiba. \"Tsunagu\" was used as the theme song for the film Mumon: The Land of Stealth starring Satoshi Ohno.\nArashi also made their first suite with \"Song for You\". It was created by incorporating melodies from various genres into a song of over ten minutes. It is said to represent the group's past, present, and future. The song \"Mikan\" (｢未完｣, lit. \"Incomplete\") was also said to epitomize the album title and contain elements of wa, digital, classical, and hip hop music. Unlike the group's previous albums, Untitled does not contain solo songs, but unit songs sung by either duos or trios.\nThe music videos use \"duality\", as in \"light and shadow\" and \"virtual images and real images\", as their theme. Unlike previously released music videos, the scenes of the group appearing together are few and are mostly solo shots.\n\n\n== Promotion ==\nTo support the album, Arashi performed a live tour called Arashi Live Tour 2017-2018 Untitled.

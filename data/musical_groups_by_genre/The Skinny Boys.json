Harrison), his brother Shockin' Shawn (Shaun Harrison), and The Human Jock Box (Jacque D. Lloyd). Previously, the group included a fourth member, Robert \"ELD\" Durrett. The Skinny Boys were influenced by the much more prominent hip hop pioneers The Fat Boys, and their single \"Jock Box\" was influenced by The Fat Boys' member Human Beat Box. \n\n\n== History and appearances in multimedia ==\nThe Skinny Boys began creating music and performing together in 1981 as the Superior Crush MC's on the independent record label Bush, run by Rhonda Bush. Indeed, Rhonda and Mark Bush were the group's managers. The Skinny Boys' first release was a 12-inch single \"Awesome\" b/w \"Skinny Boys\" in 1985. The New York City-based label Warlock Records signed the group in 1986. That year the label released two more of their singles, \"Jockbox\" and \"Unity\", as well as an album, Weightless.

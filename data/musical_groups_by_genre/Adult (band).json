    "text": "Adult (stylized as ADULT.) is an American band from Detroit, Michigan, formed in 1998 by married couple Nicola Kuperus and Adam Lee Miller. The band integrates vocals with drum machines, analog synthesizers and electronic/punk elements. Both band members have art degrees. Miller has a painting degree, and Kuperus a photography degree.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore forming Adult, Miller was one half of the band Le Car and released solo material under the name Artificial Material. Adult began releasing albums in 1998 under the pseudonym Plasma Co. Initially, the band members were uncredited and not publicized, but by the time Anxiety Always was released, Adult was listed as husband-and-wife team Adam Lee Miller and Nicola Kuperus. Miller and Kuperus are also the founders of the Ersatz Audio record label. When launching their tour in support of the D.U.M.E. EP, Adult announced that they had become a trio with the addition of guitarist Samuel Consiglio. The trio was short-lived – Consiglio left the band at the start of 2006. While popular in their home city of Detroit, they also enjoy a cult following throughout the rest of the US and are also very popular in Germany and the United Kingdom. They toured with Trans Am in 2002, and in May 2003, the band made its first headlining tour in the United States; gigs across Europe followed soon after. \nAdult have remixed other artists, most notably Felix da Housecat, Fischerspooner, Ladytron, A Number of Names, The Faint, Erase Errata and Bis. Kuperus (who is also responsible for Adult's album artwork and photography) has sung on the recordings of other electronic acts including Death in Vegas, Swayzak and Chicks On Speed. Kuperus has also showcased her photography at museums around the United States and Europe. Between 2008 and 2010, Adult produced the film \"thee Three Graces tryptic: Decampment, Traditions & Possession(s)\", which was only shown with Adult performing the score live. It was screened at Anthology Film Archives (NY), Detroit Institute of Arts (Detroit), Distrital y Cineteca National: Mexico City Film Festival amongst other theaters.  In 2010, Adult wrote and recorded the original score to the film OPEN by Jake Yuzna.  In 2013, the art museum Mattress Factory in Pittsburgh invited Adult to contribute an installation; the result was called Diptyching which included audio, video, and the re-creation of a life size façade of a house. In conjunction with the piece, Adult released a limited edition 12\" Work/Wreck which included the music from the installation.\nAdult's eighth studio album, Perception is/as/of Deception, was released in April 2020 on Dais.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2001 Resuscitation – Ersatz Audio\n2003 Anxiety Always – Ersatz Audio\n2005 Gimmie Trouble – Thrill Jockey\n2007 Why Bother? – Thrill Jockey\n2012 Resuscitation (Vinyl reissue) – Ghostly International\n2013 The Way Things Fall – Ghostly International\n2017 Live at Third Man – Third Man Records\n2017 Detroit House Guests – Mute\n2018 This Behavior – Dais\n2020 Perception is/as/of Deception – Dais\n2022 Becoming Undone - Dais\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n1998 Modern Romantics 12\" (as Plasma Co.) – Electrecord\n1998 Dispassionate Furniture 12\" – Ersatz Audio\n1999 Entertainment 12\" – Ersatz Audio\n2000 New-Phonies 12\" – Clone Records\n2000 Nausea 12\" – Ersatz Audio\n2001 Hand To Phone 12\" – Clone Records\n2002 Misinterpreted 12\" – Ersatz Audio\n2002 Limited Edition 7\" – Ersatz Audio\n2002 Hand To Phone Remixed 12\" – Clone Records\n2003 Controlled Edition 7\" – Ersatz Audio\n2004 T & A. 7\" – Ersatz Audio\n2004 Split/Split/Split 7\" – Ersatz Audio/Cass Records\n2005 D.U.M.E. 12\"/CD – Thrill Jockey\n2005 Numbers + ADULT. = This Seven Inch 7\" – Kill Rock Stars\n2008 The Decampment Trilogy (3 7\"s [limited to 100 copies each] with photographic prints taken by Nicola Kuperus) – Ersatz Audio\n2008 Let's Feel Bad Together CD-R – Ersatz Audio\n2012 Shari Vari / 122 Hours of Fear (covers of songs originally by The Screamers and A Number of Names) – Ghostly International\n2013 Work/Wreck 12\" – Ersatz Audio\n2017 Detroit House Guests: Variations (Digital only) – Mute\n2017 Detroit House Guests: The Remixes 12\" – Mute\n2019 Subsurface/Coming Apart 7\" – Dais\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n1998 D.I.E. \"The Man You Never See\" – Clone Records\n1999 Ganymed \"Music Takes Me Higher\" – Sabotage Communications\n1999 Ectomorph \"The Haunting\" – Intuit-Solar\n1999 Michiko Kusaki \"Let's Rock\" – Angelika Köhlermann\n2000 Mat101 \"Arcade\" – Nature Records\n2000 Fischerspooner – (\"Emerge\")\n2000 Tuxedomoon \"No Tears\" – Gigolo Records\n2001 Solvent \"Flexidisc\" – Suction Records\n2001 Kitbuilders \"Girls on Stage\" – Vertical Records\n2001 K-Rock \"Hardedged Industry\" – Breakin' Records\n2001 Solenoid \"Narcissistic\"- Haio Haio Haio Records\n2001 G.D.Luxxe \"I'm Always Busy\" – Interdemsional Transmissions\n2001 The Faint \"Agenda Suicide\" – City Slang/Labels\n2001 Phoenecia \"Rhythm Box\" – Schematic Music Co.\n2002 A Number of Names \"Shari Vari\" – Puzzlebox Records\n2002 Bobby Conn \"Winners\" – Thrill Jockey\n2002 Jackass & Mule \"1-2-3 Miami\" – xylpohone jones\n2002 Jolly Music \"Radio Jolly\" – Illustrious Records / Sony\n2002 Bis \"Robotic\" – SpinArt Records\n2002 Felix da Housecat featuring Miss Kittin – (\"Silver Screen Shower Scene\") – City Rockers\n2002 Death in Vegas – (\"Hands Around My Throat\") – BMG International\n2003 Erase Errata \"Marathon\" – TroubleMan Unlimited\n2004 Electronicat \"I Wanna Know Now\" – Angelika Köhlermann\n2008 Ladytron \"Runaway\" -Nettwerk2008 Tussle \"Night of the Hunter\" – FrequeNC\n2009 Trisomie21 \"Hear Me Now\" – Le Maquis\n2016 Pet Shop Boys \"Shopping\" – Moogfest Sampler\n2016 John Foxx \"The Shadow of His Former Self\" – Metamatic Records\n2017 Barry Adamson “One Hot Mess“ – Central Control International\n2018 LIARS “Staring at Zero (ADULT. ‘Y Can’t U’ Remix)” – Mute\n\n\n=== Contributing vocals from Nicola Kuperus ===\n2002 Death in Vegas \"Hands Around My Throat\" – BMG International\n2002 Swayzak \"I Dance Alone\" – Stud!o K7\n2003 Chicks on Speed \"Wordyrappinghood\" – ChicksonSpeed Records\n2009 Tyrell Corporation \"Lose the Hero\" – Clone Records\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nInterview with Adam Lee Miller by Alexander Laurence\nInterview by Alexander Laurence (The Portable Infinite)"

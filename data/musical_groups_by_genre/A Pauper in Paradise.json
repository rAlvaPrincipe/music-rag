    "text": "A Pauper in Paradise is the fifth studio album by Italian-Canadian singer Gino Vannelli, released in 1977. It was notable for including contributions by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra on the second side, including a fifteen-minute title track symphony that took Gino five months to write, and which led A&M to offer a warning to Gino to expand his appeal or face rapid declines in album sales that since Powerful People had been a steady 300,000 albums per release.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Detailed personnel ==\nArt Direction – Fabio Nicoli, Roland Young (3)\nBacking Vocals – Jay Stone, Joanie Bartels\nBacking Vocals, Design, Artwork – Joanne Jayde\nDrums – Casey Scheuerell\nEngineer – John Kurlander (tracks: 7 to 10), Norm Kinney\nEngineer [Assistent] – Steve Prestage\nEngineer [Re-mix] – Jon Kelly\nKeyboards – Chris Rhyne\nLeader – Barry Griffiths (tracks: 7 to 10)\nLyrics By, Music By – Gino Vannelli\nMastered By – Bernie Grundman\nOrchestra – The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (tracks: 7 to 10)\nOrchestrated By, Conductor – Don Sebesky (tracks: 7 to 10)\nPercussion – Dido* (tracks: 6), John J.

The co-founder of Pro Era, Capital Steez, died by suicide in December 2012, followed by the death of ASAP Yams in 2015, who is credited for introducing Pro Era to the Flatbush Zombies.\nIn 2019, the supergroup released three singles ahead of their debut album, Escape from New York, released on May 24, 2019.

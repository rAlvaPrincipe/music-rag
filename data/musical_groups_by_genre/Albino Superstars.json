    "text": "Albino Superstars is a small Norwegian band consisting of 2 members; Fridtjof Støre (vocal), and Andreas Schüller (songwriter), both from the small town of Drøbak, outside Oslo. They are childhood friends, and started working with music together in 2004. The first song \"Popular\" became a local hit. And by the end of the 2005 summer they had produced a music video to the song with the Norwegian producer Jørgen Johannesen.\nIn the original video, neither Støre or Schüller wanted to be on-screen, so the part of \"the popular guy\" which the song is about is being played by Andrè Anker-Hansen Rønbeck. They did however had a small part where they appeared as workers in the mansion where the movie was recorded. Ultimately, the producers insisted that they had a part in the video, so they became a part of the final cut. Making the whole movie as the lead character's dream instead.\nAs they are not able to live off the music, Støre works as a pump-mechanic in Oslo, while Schüller is attending the Paul McCartney funded school LIPA where he has 2 remaining years as a student.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nPopular\nVarious - McMusic 40 (CD, Comp)\n\nMcMusic ANS  2007\n\nTeam Disco (12 and 2 more...\nVarious - Fierce Disco III (3xCD, Comp)\n\nFierce Angel Records  2009\n\n\n== Music ==\nStarting with \"Popular\" which became a popular tune for young people, Albino Superstars quickly became popular with the Norwegian Russ and in 2005, 2006, and 2007 they created songs for tour buses which the Russ used when they travel around in Norway. They held their first live concert in Oslo on 12 May 2007 for about 2000 Russ.\nThe first official release of \"Popular\" on 16 May 2007 became the number 1 sold single in Norway the first 2 weeks on the market.

    "text": "The Apollinaires were a British 2 Tone/post-punk group from Leicester, England, signed to 2 Tone Records.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band formed in Leicester as a six-piece, composed of musicians from various local bands and students from the Leicester School of Art. Four members of the band had previously been in an industrial band named I Y A Volkswagens, which had released one single on Rough Trade Records called \"Kill Myself\". After the demise of that band they reformed as The Volkswagens, and as their sound moved from post-punk to a more dance sound, they worked with members of another Leicester band called The Swinging Laurels as their horn section.\nIn 1982 the band signed to Coventry's 2 Tone Records and changed their name to The Apollinaires, expanding to a ten-piece at the same time with the addition an in-house horn section. They recorded their first single, \"The Feeling's Gone\" with Jerry Dammers, featuring vocals from Rhoda Dakar of The Bodysnatchers.\nAfter this the band toured extensively in the UK with bands including The Higsons and The Beat, and also played concerts in France, recorded BBC Radio 1 sessions for John Peel and Kid Jensen, and released a second single entitled \"Envy the Love\". Their TV appearances included Channel 4's The Switch. They also released a third single in 1983 on a small Birmingham independent label entitled \"Put People First\". Eventually, however, the band split up due to the difficulties of co-ordinating their large number of members.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPaul Tickle, Vocals\nTom Brown, guitar\nFrancis Brown, Guitar (died 17 March 2010)\nKraig Thornber, Drums\nJames Hunt, Bass\nSimon Kirk, Percussion\nPeter Millen, Alto Sax.

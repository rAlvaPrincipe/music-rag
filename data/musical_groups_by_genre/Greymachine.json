    "text": "Greymachine is an experimental music project founded in 2006. It is led by Godflesh and Jesu frontman Justin Broadrick. The act also features Isis frontman and guitarist Aaron Turner, Jesu bassist Diarmuid Dalton and Head of David bassist Dave Cochrane.\nBroadrick started Greymachine as a solo project with some \"drum beats I'd recorded, along with very abstract, improvised guitar parts and lot's [sic] of synth noise.\" He eventually enlisted other contributors for the project. The debut album of the act, Disconnected, was released on 4 August 2009, via Turner's own record label, Hydra Head Records. Allmusic described the album as \"one of the most anticipated metal records of the year.\" The track “Vultures Descend” from the album was released as a promotional single.\nAbout the project, Broadrick stated: \"Most of my music has a strong sense of misanthropy. Greymachine just [more obviously] deals with self loathing, self disgust, frustration, isolation, disillusionment, ego, exhibitionism and utter confusion, fear and disenchantment.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nJustin Broadrick - guitar, vocals, electronics, programming, drums\nDave Cochrane - bass\nDiarmuid Dalton - bass\nAaron Turner - guitar, vocals, electronics\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nDisconnected (2009)\nSingles\n\"Vultures Descend\" (2009)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGreymachine - Disconnected on Hydra Head Records"

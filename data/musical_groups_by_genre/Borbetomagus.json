    "text": "Borbetomagus are a free jazz/noise rock group. They are cited by critics as pioneers of aggressive improvised noise music.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorbetomagus formed in 1979 when saxophone players Jim Sauter and Don Dietrich joined with electric guitarist Donald Miller. Sauter and Deitrich were fans of and frequent callers to Miller's radio show on WKCR (Columbia University) which lead to them collaborating. Bass guitarist Adam Nodelman was briefly a member, and they have occasionally collaborated with others.\nTheir aggressive music has been described as \"a huge, overpowering, take-no-prisoners mass of sound.\"  One extended technique they use is called \"bells together\" where Sauter and Dietrich place the bells (openings) of their saxophones against one other while playing.  \nWhile the core trio listed above has been responsible for most of Borbetomagus's music, they have collaborated with Swiss circuit bending duo Voice Crack, Dutch cellist Tristan Honsinger, German double-bassist Peter Kowald, multi-instrumentalist Milo Fine, the band Fat on their album Hit, and others. In 2006, they recorded a collaborative album with Hijokaidan live at the Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville, Canada, and in 2007 their long out-of-print cassette Live In Allentown was released on CD with nearly twice as much material as the original. Sauter and Dietrich have also recorded a duo album and a collaborative album with Sonic Youth guitarist Thurston Moore. \n\n\n== Name ==\nBorbetomagus refers to the Celtic origin of the German city of Worms.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\nThey are considered widely influential on the Japanese noise music scene, as demonstrated by the re-release of their limited Live At Inroads cassette on CD by the Japanese label P.S.F. Records, as well as having a CD released by Osaka-based noise label Alchemy Records.\nThey have been influential on many American rock, free jazz, and noise musicians, such as Sonic Youth, Pelt, Thomas Ankersmit, and Kevin Drumm.  Miller has worked with Pelt; he now resides in New Orleans, where he frequently collaborates live with Rob Cambre and others on E-Bowed guitars.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBorbetomagus (Agaric 1980)\nWork on What Has Been Spoiled (Agaric 1981)\nBorbetomagus (Agaric 1982)\nAt In Roads (Sound Cluster 1982, Cause And Effect, P.S.F PSFD-19 1993)\nIndustrial Strength (Leo LR113 1983)\nBarbed Wire Maggots (Agaric 1983)\nBorbeto Jam (Cadence CJR 1026)\nZurich (Agaric 1984)\nBells Together (Agaric 1985)\nNew York Performances (Agaric 1986)\nLive in Allentown (LowLife LL02 1986, Agaric 1998)\nSeven Reasons for Tears (Purge Sound League 027, Agaric 1993)\nFish That Sparkling Bubble (Agaric 1987 / Uhlang Produktion UP 06) with Voice Crack\nSnuff Jazz (Agaric 1988, 1990)\nBarefoot in the Head (Forced Exposure 1990) with Thurston Moore and liner notes purportedly by Thomas Pynchon\nAsbestos Shake (Agaric 1989, Uhlang Produktion UP 08, V-Records V2) with Voice Crack\nBuncha Hair That Long (Agaric 1990)\nCoelacanth (Agaric 1991) with Shaking Ray Levis\nExperience the Magic (Agaric 1992)\nL'Atlas Des Galaxies Etranges (Non Mi Piace NMPR 01 OK, 1993)\nLive in Tokyo (Alchemy ARCD-095)\nSongs Our Mother Taught Us (Agaric 1995)\nBoth Noise Ends Burning (Les Disques Victo 2007) with Hijokaidan\nBorbetomagus à Go Go (Agaric 1997)\nThe Rape of Atlanta (Eyedrum 2010)\nTrente belles années (Agaric 2012)\nVole Lotta Love (Tyyfus/Verdura 2013)\nThe Eastcote Studios Session (Dancing Wayang 2016)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nhttp://www.myspace.com/borbetomagus\nInterview for the Perfect Sound Forever webzine\nTrouser Press entry\nPitchfork webzine\nMP3 Interview"

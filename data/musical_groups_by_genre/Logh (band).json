    "text": "Logh (pronounced log) is a post-rock band formed in 1998 in Lund, Sweden. With four members, their first LP was released in 2002 on Bad Taste Records, incorporating elements of indie rock and shoegaze with hushed vocals and introspective lyrics. Played at Sleazys. The album was followed by two more, with lo-fi shoegazer elements, lightly brushed snares, subtle guitar strumming, and droning bass lines.\nAfter their second album, Kristofer Ronstrom (drums) was dropped from the band lineup, eventually replaced by not one but three new members, Markku Hild√©n (drums), Mattias Jeppsson, (guitar) and Karl Arvidson (keyboards).\n\n\n== Discography ==\nEvery Time a Bell Rings an Angel Gets His Wings (2002)\nThe Raging Sun (2003)\nThe Contractor and the Assassin EP (2003)\nA Sunset Panorama (2005)\nNorth (2007) (peaked at no 45 in Sweden)\nCompilations\n\nThe Emo Diaries Ch. 8: My Very Last Breath (2002)\nSingles (7\" Vinyl)\n\nGhosts (2002)\nAn Alliance of Hearts (2003)\nThe Bones of Generations (2004)\nLights From Sovereign States (2007)\nThe Raging Sun (2007)\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nEvery Time a Bell Rings an Angel Gets His Wings was originally released under the name Log.

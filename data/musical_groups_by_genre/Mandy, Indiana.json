    "text": "Mandy, Indiana are an English-French noise rock band based between Manchester and Berlin, formed in 2018. The band's lineup consists of vocalist and lyricist Valentine Caulfield, guitarist and producer Scott Fair, synth player Simon Catling, and drummer Alex Macdougall.\nCaulfield is from Paris and a native French speaker, and sings entirely in French. The band's name is derived from Gary, Indiana, changing the city name with \"Mandy\" because they liked the sound of it.\nThe band released their debut album, I've Seen a Way, in 2023 to positive reception. It was partially recorded in a cave in the West Country and in a nearby crypt.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAdapted from AllMusic Guide, Discogs, and MusicBrainz.\n\n\n=== Studio album ===\nI've Seen a Way (2023)\n\n\n=== EP ===\n...EP (2021)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Nike of Samothrace\" (2020)\n\"Pashto\" (2020)\n\"Berlin\" (2020)\n\"Alien 3\" (2021)\n\"Bottle Episode\" (2021)\n\"Injury Detail\" (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMandy, Indiana at AllMusic \nMandy, Indiana discography at Discogs \nMandy, Indiana discography at MusicBrainz"

    "text": "Daybehavior is a Swedish indie-pop trio, founded in Stockholm, in 1993 by Tommy Arell, Paulinda Crescentini and Carl Hammar.   The trio's music is heavy influenced by movies, electronics and beats.\n\n\n== History ==\nTheir debut album Adored was released in 1996 by Swedish indie label North of No South Records (NONS). Per Gessle's  company JimmyFun Music, released the album in 15 countries worldwide. The album received positive reviews in publications including New Musical Express, Select, The Times and Melody Maker.\nDuring 1998 and 1999 they, recorded their follow-up album with Kevin Petri, engineer on Massive Attack's debut album Blue Lines (1991).  NONS, dealing with financial problems, went into bankruptcy 99 and the album was locked from being released. The band in despair decided to take a break and Arell moved to Thailand.\nBy 2003, Crescentini and Hammar decided to finish the album, now updated with some new material. Their second album, Have You Ever Touched a Dream? was released in 2004 by American indie label A Different Drum.\nCrescentini and Hammar, not feeling comfortable with the missing part of the trio as well as having musical differences, decided to put the band on hold.\nIn 2009, Arell thought it was time to rejoin the band and started to work on new material.\nDuring summer and fall 2010, the band recorded their new album, FOLLOW THAT CAR!, which was released September 2012.\nThe band also made original music for a film, Ellinor's Wedding (Ellinors br√∂llop; 1996) and have had several songs in the Dance Dance Revolution music video game.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCulture in Stockholm\nList of indie pop artists\nMusic of Sweden\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDaybehavior at AllMusic"

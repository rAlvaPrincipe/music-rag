    "text": "Omar And The Howlers is a Texas based electric blues and blues rock band, The original Howlers was formed in Hattiesburg, Mississippi in 1973. Three years later they moved to Austin, Texas. The band has regularly toured European countries. Led by singer/guitarist Omar Dykes, they are best known for the 1987 album Hard Times in the Land of Plenty which sold over half a million copies and whose title song was a top 20 hit in America.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nOmar Kent Dykes grew up in McComb, Mississippi, began playing the guitar at age 12 and started his first band at 13. In his 20s, he gathered a group of musicians who started calling themselves 'the Howlers'. They specialized in frat parties and were a party band, playing music that included both \"R&B, R&R and even the occasional polka and western swing tune\". Dykes has said he remembers these days fondly. It was around this time that he started calling himself Omar and developed his penchant for the blues.\nIn 1976, the Howlers relocated to Austin, Texas, at the time sporting a bustling music scene, home to such up-and-coming artists as Stevie Ray Vaughan and Eric Johnson. After a year of gigging in Austin, the rest of the band quit, feeling that they were not cut out to play music full-time. As they headed back to Mississippi, Dykes stayed and kept the name. He worked out a new lineup, and recorded the debut album Big Leg Beat for Amazing Records in 1980, just after fellow Austin band The Fabulous Thunderbirds. The record was a local hit and was followed by I Told You So.\n\n\n== Success ==\nIt was not until 1987, however, when Dykes signed a recording contract with Columbia, that the band would succeed. That year saw the release of Hard Times in the Land of Plenty, that went on to sell over 500,000 copies. The band now consisted of Dykes singing and playing guitar, Bruce Jones on bass, and Wes Starr on drums. Dykes and this rhythm section have been playing together off and on for over 30 years.\nSince then, Omar And The Howlers has released around twenty-five albums on Amazing, Austin, Columbia, Antone's, Bullseye Blues, Watermelon, Black Top, Blind Pig, Provogue, Ruf Records, and their current record label, Big Guitar Music.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nOmar Dykes - vocals, guitar\nBruce Jones - bass\nGene Brandon - drums (died: January 8, 2014)\nEric \"Scorch\" Scortia - Hammond B-3 organ, piano, synthesizers\nStephen Bruton - guitar (died: May 9, 2009)\nPaul Junior - bass\nSteve Kilmer - drums\nGary Primich - harmonica (died: September 23, 2007)\nNick Connolly - organ\nWes Starr - drums\nBarry Bihm - bass\nKevin Hall - Drums\nMike Buck - drums\nKaz Kazanoff - tenor saxophone\nRichard Price - tenor saxophone and percussion (died: April 07, 2020)\nJason Crisp - bass\nRonnie James - bass\nBarry \"Frosty\" Smith - drums (died: April 12, 2017)\nJon Hahn - drums\nFred Tripp - drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\nBig Leg Beat (1980)\nI Told You So (1984)\nHard Times in the Land of Plenty (1987)\nWall of Pride (1988)\nMonkey Land (1990)\nBlues Bag - [Omar Dykes] (1991)\nLive at Paradiso (1992)\nCourts of Lulu (1993)\nMuddy Springs Road (1995)\nWorld Wide Open (1996)\nSouthern Style (1997)\nSwingland (1998)\nLive at the Opera House: Austin, Texas - August 30, 1987 (2000)\nThe Screamin' Cat (2000)\nBig Delta (2002)\nBoogie Man (2004)\nBamboozled: Live in Germany (2006)\nOn The Jimmy Reed Highway - [Omar Kent Dykes and Jimmie Vaughan] (2007)\nChapel Hill - [Nalle, Omar &  Magic Slim] (2008)\nBig Town Playboy - [Omar Kent Dykes featuring Jimmie Vaughan and Friends] (2009)\nEssential Collection (2012) 2CD compilation\nI'm Gone (2012)\nToo Much is Not Enough - [Omar & The Howlers featuring Gary Primich] (2012)\nJust a Little Bit More... - [Gary Primich with Omar Dykes] (2012)\nRunnin' With the Wolf - [Omar Dykes] (2013)\nToo Raw for Radio [previously unreleased recordings from 1981] (2014)\nThe Kitchen Sink (2015)\nZoltar's Walk (2017)\nSingles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nRussian Music Info Pages"

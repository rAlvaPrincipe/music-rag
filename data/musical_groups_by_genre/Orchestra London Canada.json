    "text": "Orchestra London (Canada) was a professional symphony orchestra based in London, Ontario in Canada. \nThere was a group under the name London Symphony Orchestra performing in London, Ontario in the 1890s. In the 1890s a group of about 41 players performed in London, Ontario, Canada, as the London Symphony Orchestra. This group pre-dated the famous orchestra in London, England with the same name, which was founded in 1904.\nThe current orchestra was founded by conductor and violinist Bruce Sharpe in 1937 with the name the London Civic Symphony Orchestra. In 1957, with increased numbers of professional players, the orchestra changed its name to the London Symphony Orchestra, but as the orchestra achieved full professional status it adopted the name Orchestra London in 1981 to avoid confusion with the famous London Symphony Orchestra in London, England.\nAfter weeks of speculation, the orchestra ceased operations on December 11, 2014 due to massive budget shortfalls.   The musicians of the now bankrupt organization formally filed for bankruptcy on behalf of the orchestra on May 22, 2015.  Despite this, the contracted musicians of the ensemble have continued to put on self-produced concerts within the London community.\nInitially, former musicians of the ensemble played under the identity, \"#WePlayOn\". On January 20, 2017, however, the musicians launched their new identity, London Symphonia at a concert at Metropolitan United Church in London, Ontario. The new identity includes a logo change and the launch of a new website, LondonSymphonia.ca. The group has 28 musicians and a concertmaster. The London Symphonia performs with renowned soloists such as violinist James Ehnes and pianist Janina Fialkowska. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of symphony orchestras\nCanadian classical music\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"The Musicians of Orchestra London\".\n\"London Symphonia\""

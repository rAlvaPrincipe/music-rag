    "text": "Kasino is an eurodance group from Brazil. The group consists of Fabio Almeida and Ian Duarte, the founding members, and Fher Cassini who fronted the project. Conceived to be only a studio project, Kasino rose to fame after the sudden inclusion of their first single \"Can't Get Over\" on the official soundtrack of the telenovela América. Quickly the music became a hit in Brazil. Some people who knew the group did not know that it was composed by Brazilians. According to ECAD, \"Can't Get Over\" was the 18th most played song in Southern Brazil between January and March 2006 and the 6th most played song in Northern Brazil between January and March 2006. Another successful song was \"Shake It\", which was the 14th most played song in the South of Brazil between April and June 2007. Other songs that were featured on soap opera tracks were \"Sexy Baby\", in Sabor da Paixão, in 2003, and \"Shake It \", in Páginas da Vida, 2006.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2014, the group Kasino returned with the single \"So Free\", which was recorded at Eclips studio, and released on March 6, 2014.\nThe musical project Kasino is still well remembered on social networks, especially for a video of the group performing on the Sabadaço program, hosted by Gilberto Barros.\nKasino is currently back with founding members Fabio Almeida and Ian Duarte on the front. Their comeback single \"Get Down\" was released on October 7, 2022.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIt was recently confirmed by Fabio Almeida and Ian Duarte, the producers and founding members of the Kasino project, that they were responsible for Kasino's vocals from the beginning. Fher had been hired in 2005 to lead the project and promote the songs but he didn't sing the first two singles from their debut album. The lead vocals on the massive hits \"Can't Get Over\" and \"Stay Tonight\" were provided by Fabio Almeida, even though it's Fher who is shown on the respective music videos. However Fher sang all the following tracks on the album and shared lead vocals with Fabio on the track \"Secret Lover\" as well.\nBetween 2007-2008, Kasino went through some changes. Fher resigned from the project and soon after a new vocalist arrived to the group, Bo Anders. He left in 2009 after the producers decided to temporarily shut down Kasino's activities. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Eurodance artists\n\n\n== References =="

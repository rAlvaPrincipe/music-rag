    "text": "Prairie Oyster was a Canadian country music group from Toronto, Ontario. They were named Country Group or Duo of the year six times by both the Canadian Country Music Association (CCMA) and the Juno Awards. The band also won the Bud Country Fans' Choice Award from the CCMA in 1994. They have four No. 1 country singles in Canada, with an additional 12 singles reaching the Canadian Country Top 10. Eight of their albums have been certified gold or platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association, including the 1992 CCMA Album of the Year Everybody Knows.\nWhile no formal announcement seems to have been made, the band is no longer touring nor are they maintaining their web site. Front-man Russell deCarle has been touring solo to promote a new album. Guitarist Keith Glass released his own solo album in 2013 and has been touring on his own as well as backing up other artists, such as Lynn Miles.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPrairie Oyster formed in 1974 in Toronto. As a trio, consisting of singer/bassist Russell deCarle (born 31 May 1954), guitarist Keith Glass (born 1952) and steel guitarist Dennis Delorme, they toured and performed on television, but did not record.\nThe band's name is taken from a slang term for bison, cattle, or sheep testicles. (See also the Wikipedia article on Rocky Mountain Oysters.) \nThey subsequently broke up in 1978.\nIn 1982, the band reunited, adding fiddler John P. Allen, keyboardist Joan Besen and drummer John Adames to the lineup. Bruce Moffat soon replaced Adames, and the group released its debut album, Oyster Tracks, in 1986 on Stony Plain Records. The album found its way to RCA Records executive Joe Galante, who signed the group after seeing them perform. RCA wanted the band to change their name, but they were already too well known. Prairie Oyster was named Country Group or Duo of the Year at the Juno Awards in 1986 and 1987.\nTheir first album for RCA, Different Kind of Fire, was released in 1990 in both Canada and the United States. On the success of the album, Prairie Oyster was named the CCMA Group or Duo of the Year in 1990 and 1991. They also won the Juno Award for Country Group or Duo of the Year in 1991. All four singles released reached the top 15 in Canada, including the top 5s \"Goodbye, So Long, Hello,\" \"I Don't Hurt Anymore\" and \"Something to Remember You By.\" The band didn't do as well in the United States however, with the highest-charting single peaking at No. 62. \"Goodbye, So Long, Hello\" was the CCMA Single of the Year in 1990. The following year, \"Lonely You, Lonely Me\" was named Song of the Year by the CCMA. In March 1991, the band received a nomination from the Academy of Country Music for Top New Group or Duo.\nPrairie Oyster's third album, Everybody Knows, was released in 1991. The album featured four top 10 singles in Canada: \"Did You Fall In Love with Me,\" \"One Precious Love,\" \"Will I Do (Till the Real Thing Comes Along)\" and \"Everybody Knows.\" Unfortunately, only one single charted in the U.S., \"One Precious Love\" (#51). Prairie Oyster won several CCMA Awards in 1992, including Album of the Year for Everybody Knows, Song of the Year for \"Did You Fall In Love with Me,\" as well as their third straight win as Group or Duo of the Year. The Juno Awards also awarded them Country Group or Duo of the Year for the fourth time.\nThe band's fourth album, Only One Moon, was released in Canada on Arista Records in 1994. It would also go on to become their most successful. The first single, \"Such a Lonely One,\" was also their first No. 1 in Canada. Two more singles released from the project also reached the top of the Canadian Country chart, \"Don't Cry Little Angel\" and the title track. Additional singles \"Louisiette,\" \"Black-Eyed Susan\" and \"Ancient History\" all reached the top 10. They were named Group or Duo of the Year by the CCMA in 1994, 1995 and 1996, and won the Bud Country Fans' Choice Award in 1994. The Juno Awards also recognized Prairie Oyster as the Country Group or Duo of the Year in both 1995 and 1996.\nTheir fifth album, Blue Plate Special, was released in 1996. The first song released from the disc, \"Unbelievable Love,\" reached No. 1. \"One Way Track\" was also a top 5, but follow-up singles peaked outside the top 10. Bohdan Hluszko replaced Bruce Moffat as the drummer on the album. The following year, Hluszko was fired from the band after coming out as transgender.\nWith the 1998 release of their sixth album, What Is This Country?, the group returned to the top 10 with the songs \"Canadian Sunrise\" (#5) and \"Keep On Dreaming (#9). Charlie Cooley filled in as drummer for the band. Cooley is the father of Canadian actor Ryan Cooley.\nThe band released their first greatest hits album, String of Pearls: A Greatest Hits Collection, in 2000. The only song released from the project was \"Man in the Moon,\" which had been re-recorded as a duet with folk singer-songwriter Jenny Whiteley.\nPrairie Oyster re-surfaced in 2006 with the release of their latest album, One Kiss, on Open Road Recordings. So far the album has produced three singles, \"Sweet Sweet Girl to Me\" (written and originally recorded by Don Gibson), \"Too Bad For Me,\" and a cover of Bob Dylan's \"I Threw It All Away.\" The group continues to tour and perform at music festivals and clubs in Canada and the United States.\nPrairie Oyster was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008.\nIn 2011 the band was presented with a SOCAN National Achievement Award.\nThe band is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.\n\n\n== Solo Projects ==\nRussell deCarle currently tours and records with his solo group The Russell deCarle Trio, which play an eclectic mix of blues, jazz, country & western, Latin music, R&B and western swing. The current configuration of deCarle's band features him playing rhythm guitar instead of bass. In 2012, deCarle released his first studio album, \"Under the Big Big Sky.\" The studio album was released by Universal Music. In 2015, one of deCarle's concerts was professionally recorded and later released as \"Live At Loud Mouse Studios.\" Music critics have compared deCarle's solo recordings to other eclectic Country music and roots rock acts such as Chris Isaak, Willie Nelson, The Mavericks, Lyle Lovett, Raul Malo and Los Lobos.\nKeith Glass currently performs with Canadian folk artist Lynn Miles and also with his group Keith Glass Band. In addition to working as a songwriter and producer, Glass is a music historian who wrote the liner notes for The Box Tops CD box set release entitled \"The Original Albums 1967â€“69,\" which was released in January 2015 by Raven Records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nAlbums\n1986 Oyster Tracks\n1990 Different Kind of Fire\n1991 Everybody Knows\n1994 Only One Moon\n1996 Blue Plate Special\n1998 What Is This Country?\n2000 String of Pearls: A Greatest Hits Collection\n2006 One Kiss\n\n\n== Solo discography ==\n2013 Bad Dog Keith Glass\n2012 Under The Big Big Sky Russell deCarle\n2015 Live at Loud Mouse Studios Russell deCarle\n2017 Alone in This Crowd Russell deCarle\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nCanadian Country Music Awards\n\n1990 Group or Duo of the Year\n1990 Single of the Year, \"Goodbye, So Long, Hello\"\n1991 Group or Duo of the Year\n1991 SOCAN Song of the Year, \"Lonely You, Lonely Me\"\n1992 Group or Duo of the Year\n1992 SOCAN Song of the Year, \"Did You Fall In Love with Me\"\n1992 Album of the Year, Everybody Knows\n1994 Bud Country Fans' Choice Award\n1994 Group or Duo of the Year\n1995 Group or Duo of the Year\n1996 Group or Duo of the Year\nJuno Awards\n\n1986 Best Country Group or Duo\n1987 Best Country Group or Duo\n1991 Best Country Group or Duo\n1992 Best Country Group or Duo\n1995 Best Country Group or Duo\n1996 Best Country Group or Duo\nSOCAN Awards\n\n2011 National Achievement Award\n\n\n=== Nominations ===\nAcademy of Country Music\n\n1990 Top New Vocal Duo or Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPrairie Oyster Official Site\nOfficial site for Prairie Oyster singer Russell DeCarle\nOfficial site for Prairie Oyster guitarist Keith Glass\nPrairie Oyster Fan Club\nPrairie Oyster at MapleMusic Recordings\nThe Box Tops liner notes essay by Keith Glass\nPrairie Oyster at IMDb"

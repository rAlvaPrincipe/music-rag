    "text": "Total is an American R&B girl group and one of the signature acts of the Bad Boy Records imprint during the mid-1990s. The group consists of founding members Kima Raynor, Keisha Spivey, and Pamela Long. Total is best known for their feature on Mase's \"What You Want\", as well as their hits \"Kissin' You\", \"Can't You See\" (featuring The Notorious B.I.G.), and \"What About Us?\" and \"Trippin'\", both featuring Missy Elliott. Long also sung the chorus of The Notorious B.I.G.'s hit song \"Hypnotize\", although she was not officially credited. Total made their first appearance singing the hook on The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut single, \"Juicy\", widely considered one of the greatest hip-hop songs of all time.\nIn 2019, Pamela Long announced that she is working on her debut solo album. She released a video for her single \"Why\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe trio made their first appearance singing the hook on The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut single, \"Juicy\". Garnering attention for the new group, they were also featured on the original version and \"Hip Hop Remix\" of his next single \"One More Chance\". They then immediately hit the studio with Bad Boy Records CEO Sean \"Puffy\" Combs and began work on their debut album. The first single \"Can't You See?\" first appeared on the soundtrack to 1995 motion picture, New Jersey Drive. The song featured The Notorious B.I.G. and peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as #2 on the R&B Chart. Their self-titled debut album was released nearly a year after the single. Total produced two more R&B top ten singles including:  \"No One Else\" (and its remix featuring Lil' Kim,  Foxy Brown,  and Da Brat) and '\"Kissing You\" (and its remix featuring Sean \"Puffy\" Combs). The album was certified platinum by the RIAA.\nWhile recording their second album, they appeared on numerous top ten singles, including LL Cool J's \"Loungin'/Who Do U Love?\", Foxy Brown's \"I Can't\", and Mase's \"What You Want\" featuring Keisha Epps, and Pamela Long sung the chorus on the hit \"Hypnotize\" by The Notorious B.I.G. The group also released another single, the Missy Elliott and Timbaland track \"What About Us?\" from the Soul Food soundtrack.\nTheir follow-up album, Kima, Keisha, and Pam, debuted to strong reviews, sales, and was certified gold by the RIAA. The first single, another Missy Elliott collaboration, \"Trippin'\", reached the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Their next release, \"Sitting Home\", which made Top 10 of the Billboard R&B Singles did not garner the same attention. While in heavy rotation on video networks like BET, radio chose not to play the song. A remix of the track featured rap artist Shyne.\nAfter the release of Kima, Keisha, and Pam, the girls sang the chorus to rap duo Gang Starr's 1999 single \"Discipline\" and, in 2000, they were featured on the Tony Touch single \"(I Wonder Why) He's the Greatest DJ\". They also contributed to the songs \"Crave\" to 3 Strikes and the songs \"Quick Rush\" to Bait movie soundtrack.\nIn their last official appearance together, they were thanked in the credits for their collaboration with Da Beatminerz and Talib Kweli - Anti-Love Movement in 2001 from their album Brace 4 Impak.\n\n\n=== Comeback ===\nIn 2014, Long and Dyson reunited and began performing as a duo under the \"Total\" name. On November 30, 2014, Total joined Lil' Kim, Da Brat, Missy Elliott, and Left Eye (posthumously via video) to sing \"Not Tonight (Ladies Night)\" at the 2014 Soul Train Music Awards. Angie Martinez was the only living original performer who did not perform at the event.\nIn May 2015, Total toured with R. Kelly, on the Funk Fest tour. In 2016, Spivey Epps rejoined the group for the nationwide Bad Boy Family Reunion Tour.\n\n\n=== Currently ===\nMost recently, it is rumored that Kima has rejoined the group and an additional fourth member has been added and that Total are now at work on a new album.\n* Keisha Spivey married actor Omar Epps in 2006 and is living in California. They have daughter K'marie and son Amir together; as well as Omar's daughter Aiyanna Yasmine with ex wife Yusra Salama.\n* Pamela Long still lives in New Jersey. She is a faithful member at Agape Family Worship Center located in Rahway.\n*A track by Kima featuring her sister, rapper Vita, called \"What U Want\", also recently leaked. As of 2008, Total have no desire or interest in pursuing to reband.\nIn 2024 Epps and Dyson came back together without Long and joined the Queens of R&B Tour along Xscape, SWV, 702 and MÃ½a.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\nTotal (1996)\nKima, Keisha, and Pam (1998)\n\n\n== Videography ==\nFrom Total (1996)\nNo One Else\nNo One Else (Puff Daddy Remix)\nKissin' You\nKissin' You / Oh Honey\nCan't You See\nCan't You See (Bad Boy Remix)\nDo You Think About Us\nFrom Kima, Keisha, and Pam (1998)\nTrippin'\nSitting Home\nFrom Soul Food (soundtrack) (1997)\nWhat About Us?

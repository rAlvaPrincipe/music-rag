They followed this up with a second release in 2003, again on Steinbeck Records.\nDuring 2004, the band toured extensively including a tour with Youthmovie Soundtrack Strategies, whom they released a split 12\" with on the Drowned In Sound Recordings Label. In January 2005, they released the album New General Catalogue on Drowned in Sound Recordings. The album collected the two songs from the previous split 12\" along with a further nine songs including re-recordings of songs featured on their first two releases. They followed the album with a single of \"This, Every Day, For The Rest Of Your Life\". This also included making a music video. The band finished off 2005 by supporting Bloc Party at Brixton Academy and Â¡Forward, Russia! on several dates around the UK.\nBy April 2006 the album had received a European release on the Talitres label and the band followed this up with a tour with Leeds-based band iLiKETRAiNS.

The album proved particularly popular in Japan, even getting a re-release with bonus tracks in 2008. The band went on to tour there in March 2009.\nThe band released their second album, Semester at Sea, on April 21, 2009, containing ten new songs by the band and a cover of Bob Welch's 1970s hit, \"Sentimental Lady\".  At that time, Eddie Eyeball (2 Skinnee J's) joined the band on bass guitar/backing vocals, and Phil Costello switched to guitar.\nOn October 19, 2018, the band released their fourth album, Fog Machine on Tee Pee Records.\nOn February 15, 2024, the band released \"I Wrote a Song,\" the first single from their fifth album, Shadows in Paradise, followed in April by \"Daylights.\" Shadows in Paradise was released on April 19, 2024.

    "text": "Elektrisk Regn is a new wave punk band from Bergen, Norway, founded in 1978. They appeared when new wave started growing in Norway with such bands as De Press, the Aller Værste! and Kjøtt. El-Regn was one of the first bands to introduce the underground genre in Norway.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe lead vocalist is the well known Dennis Reksten, who worked at Bergen's most famous rock bar, Garage. Elektrisk Regn writes Norwegian lyrics and sing in Bergen dialect. Their debut studio album Steinbyen was released in 1982 and shows that Reksten manages to write both funny and serious lyrics concerning serious themes (some times heavy political themes). Their most famous song is “Naboen er nynazist” (“My neighbour is a neo-Nazi”).\nTheir second studio album Kropp uten sjel arrived three years later, but then they had to wait till 2002 before the next album was released. Stein igjen shows that the band still knows how to make great new wave rock, but they never managed to reach the charts.\nThey arranged gigs on an irregular basis in Bergen from time to time.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nDennis Reksten, synth, guitar, vocal, text and melody (1978–present)\nHarald Nilsen, bass (1978–present)\nTrond Osland, guitar (1987–present)\nTom Kogstad, percussion (1979–present)\nIne Tømmerås, vocal, synth (1982–present)\nJan Gunnar Bortheim, guitar (1987–present)\nHarald Pallesen, synth, guitar, vocal (1978–1982)\nErik Reksten, percussion (1978–1979)\nSam Fossbakk, guitar (1981–1982)\nBjørn Vassbotten, guitar (1982–1987)\nRune Kogstad, percussion (1985–1987)\nMorten Eide, bass (1985–1987)\nRagnar \"Raggi\" Kolstad (2002)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSteinbyen (LP 1982 Apollon Records, Rec 90 CD with extra tracks 1994)\nSterkt stoff (LP 1982 Apollon Records)\nKropp uten sjel (LP 1985)\n\"Hilsen ElRegn\" (single 1987)\n\"Naboen er nynazist\" (single 1994)\nStein igjen Rec 90 (CD 2002)\nReprise (CD 2006, soundtrack)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe group at Groove.no\nElektrisk Regn – \"Naboen er nynazist\" on YouTube\nElektrisk Regn at AllMusic\nElektrisk Regn discography at Discogs"

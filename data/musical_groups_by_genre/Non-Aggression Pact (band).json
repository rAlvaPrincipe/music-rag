    "text": "Non-Aggression Pact (abbv. as N.A.P.) was an urban-electro-industrial music group from Tampa, Florida formed by Jeff Hillard and Jason Whitcomb.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 1990 by keyboardist/drummer, Jeff Hillard (a.k.a. Chillard) and keyboardist/vocalist Jason Whitcomb. Their music featured an abrasive industrial-dance sound, with funky, grind-hop drum loops overlain by harsh vocals and thought-provoking audio samples from various movies and documentaries. Their lyrics focused mostly on the issues of racism and mass media.\nN.A.P. released their first album Gesticulate in 1993 with bassist and pianist Dan Bates on the now defunct General Purpose Cassettes (G.P.C.) label. The electronic music was composed and sequenced with an Ensoniq EPS 16+ digital sampler. Additional sounds were taken from a Roland Juno-106 analog synthesizer.\nThe G.P.C. label usually sold merchandise with unusual packaging, as such, the Gesticulate CD was a limited-edition release with an aluminum foil cover and screen-printed artwork. The cassette tape version was sold in a metal can. There were two different versions of the CD cover printed.\nThe band's second release was 9mm Grudge in 1994 on the California-based Re-Constriction recording label. It was more guitar driven, however much of it was sampled including a riff from Van Halen appearing in a song.\nFive years later, Broadcast-Quality Belligerence was released. This marked a change in production with a shift to PC based recording software instead of their previous \"Live Take\" approach via DAT. This also appears to be the band's final commercial release. Newer material was released on their MP3.com page until the site changed formats.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nNon-Aggression Pact — Cass, EP 1990 – Retroflex Records\n.5 Honkey/Wreckage + Ruin + & + Regrets + [Redemption] – Cass 1991, all Side A tracks (with Side B feat.

    "text": "Elements is an American jazz fusion ensemble founded by bass guitarist Mark Egan and drummer Danny Gottlieb in 1982. Both Egan and Gottlieb were members of the Pat Metheny Group, and Elements's sound draws from their experience. Band members include Bill Evans, Gil Goldstein, Steve Khan and Clifford Carter. Elements last appeared to be active in the mid 90s. Gottlieb and Egan continue to record music together (featuring a more traditional jazz style) using their own names rather than the Elements moniker as of 2019.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1982 Elements (Philo)\n1984 Forward Motion (Antilles)\n1985 Blown Away (Mesa/Bluemoon)\n1987 Illumination (Novus)\n1989 Liberal Arts (Novus)\n1990 Spirit River (Novus)\n1992 Far East, Vol. 1 (Wavetone)\n1995 Far East, Vol. 2 (Wavetone)\n1996 Untold Stories (Wavetone)\n\n\n== References =="

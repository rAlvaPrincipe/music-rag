    "text": "Antares was an Italian Eurodance act that became known in the spring of 1995 with the release of their first song, \"Ride on a Meteorite\". The group, also notable by how little information was known at the time about its composition, produced a couple of other hits before disappearing in 1997.\nThe group was fronted by French models Eric Vincent, Aurore and Sophie. They turned out to be playback performers, as the real voices behind the project were provided by English rapper Asher Senator and Italian vocalist Clara Moroni.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClara Moroni official site"

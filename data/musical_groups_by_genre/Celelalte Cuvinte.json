    "text": "Celelalte Cuvinte (English:The Other Words) is a Romanian rock band formed in December 1981 by Călin Pop (lead vocals, lead guitar, and blockflöte/recorder), Marcel Breazu (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Leontin Iovan (drums), while they were still students at the Politehnica University of Timișoara in Timișoara, Banat, south-western Romania.\nThe initial name of the band was \"Sonic\" when they were still performing as university students and they were one of the most favourite musical acts of Florian Pittiș who also had an important and proactive role in endorsing them to larger audiences. The first concert of the band took place on 13 December 1981 at the Students' House in Timișoara. In 2021, the band celebrated 40 years of musical activity with an online concert scheduled on the digital platform vStage on 18 December.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed in Timișoara, while the members of the band were students there. Having won a couple of song-contests and being invited to various festivals, the band was signed to the state-owned record Electrecord label and managed to release 4 songs on the B-side of one of the company's \"Formații rock\" compilations in 1984.\nAfter finishing their studies in 1987, the group moved back to their native Oradea, and managed to release their first LP \"Celelalte Cuvinte I\".\nFollowing the release of \"Celelalte Cuvinte II\", they headed to a heavier direction, leaving behind their old school progressive rock sound and opting instead for a more aggressive style, influenced by heavy metal and thrash metal, while still maintaining a progressive edge. This heavy sound was far more pronounced on the studio album \"Armaghedon\" which was released in 1994. In addition, the band had also expressed alternative and even doom metal sounds throughout the mid to late 1990s.\nBy the early 2000s, the group had returned to their progressive rock sound, but in a more modern alternative rock-inspired direction, still maintaining Călin's distinct high-pitch vocal style. In addition, after touring the country for decades, the group had released its first live record, a double CD entitled \"Electric Live\" in 2019. Most recently, a new studio album entitled \"Clepsidra fără nisip\", has been announced to be released for the autumn of 2022. In this regard, two new tracks, more specifically the eponymous \"Clepsidra fără nisip\" (i.e. 'The hourglass without sand') and \"Aproape cerul\" (short version) have already been released on Youtube on 26 November 2021.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCălin Pop – vocals, guitar, blockflöte/recorder (since 1981 onwards)\nMarcel Breazu – bass guitar, backing vocals, songwriter (since 1981 onwards)\nLeontin Iovan – drums (since 1981 onwards)\nMarius Pop – guitar, backing vocals (since 2020 onwards)\nOvidiu Roșu – sound engineer and occasionally violin (since 1981 onwards)\nTiberiu Pop – keyboards, backing vocals (from 1986 to 2020)\nRadu Manafu – guitar, backing vocals (from 1981 to 1996)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nFormații rock 8 (Rock Bands 8) (split LP, 1985) (tracks were republished on the Celelalte Cuvinte I CD in 2006 and 2017)\nCelelalte Cuvinte I (The Other Words I) (LP/MC, 1987)  (republished on CD in 2006 and 2017)\nCelelalte Cuvinte II (The Other Words II) (LP/MC, 1990)  (republished on CD in 2006)\nSe lasă rău (Evil is Coming) (LP, 1992)\nHit-uri (Hits) (MC, 1994) (compilation)\nArmaghedon (Armageddon) (CD/MC, 1994) (republished on CD in 2007 and 2014, and on vinyl in 2021)\nVinil Collection (Vinyl Collection) (CD/MC, 1996) (contains most tracks from the first three LPs)\nIspita (The Temptation) (MC, 1997) (remastered and republished on CD and online in 2020, and on vinyl in 2022)\nNOS (CD/MC, 2004)\nStem (CD, 2008)\nUn sfârșit e un început – Muzică de colecție, Vol. 69 (CD, 2008) (compilation published with Jurnalul Național)\nTrup și suflet – Live acustic la Cinema Patria (Body and Soul – Acoustic Live at Cinema Patria) (CD/DVD, 2014)\nElectric Live (2CD/online streaming, 2019) (recorded at Sala Palatului in Bucharest, 8 December 2011)\nLumea asta (This World) (CD/2LP/online streaming, 2022) \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial Facebook page\nOfficial MySpace page\nFan site (in Romanian)\nRemus Rigo's Rock-Pages.com"

The band's music is heavily symphonic and programmed, combining melodic singing and harsh vocals, all aiming to create a cold and cinematic feeling.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHaving known one another for years, Borknagar's main songwriter/guitarist Øystein Brun and Swedish musician Andreas Hedlund realized they had a similar idea for a band since 2000.

In 2005 the music of the band now known as Cronian was finalized and released, and in 2006 they released their first full-length album, entitled Terra. The album was mastered by famed musician and producer Dan Swanö, and released by Century Media Records as the first release in a three-record deal.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAndreas Hedlund  (a.k.a.

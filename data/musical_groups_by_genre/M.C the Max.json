    "text": "M.C The MAX (Korean: 엠씨 더 맥스) is a South Korean rock band. They debuted in 2000 as a 4-member band under the name Moon Child. After the departure of member Heo Jung-min, members Lee Soo, Jeon Min-hyuk and J. Yoon regrouped in 2002 as M.C the MAX. \nThey were initially managed by the production company of Yoshiki, founding member of the Japanese heavy metal band X Japan. On September 1, 2016, it was reported that M.C the MAX had chosen to form their own music agency, 325 E&C. Their song \"Love Poem (사랑의 시)\", from their 2nd album, topped the KBS chart in February 2004. To date, they have released 8 full-length albums, several singles, and began participating in soundtrack contributions for several Korean television series as well.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2000–2001: Debut as Moon Child, Delete, 사랑하니까, and Heo Jung-min's departure ===\nM.C the MAX originally debuted in May 2000 with the release of their 1st album Delete as a quartet under the name \"Moon Child\": Lee Soo, J. Yoon, Jeon Min-hyuk and Heo Jung-min. Their 1st album consisted of mainly songs in the techno rock as well as the rock ballad genre.\nThey released their 2nd album 사랑하니까 (loosely translated to Because of Love) in May 2001. Their 2nd album had a more similar sound to what they do today, consisting mainly of ballads mixed with a rock sound. Their title song \"사랑하니까\" is a ballad song with some rock sounds mixed in. It was their last album to feature member Heo Jung-min, as he left the band in late 2001 for personal reasons.\n\n\n=== 2002–2003: Regrouping, rising popularity in Japan, and Love Is Time Sixth Sense ===\nTheir first two albums was met with limited success and after member Heo Jung-min left the band in 2001, it partially influenced their decision to disband. They then re-grouped as a trio with the remaining members under their current name \"M.C the Max\". The name change and the decision to regroup could be seen as means to release songs with improved quality than ever before, as well as be 'reborn' under a new identity. They released their first album as a trio with a new band name on October 31, 2002. They steered into music of the ballad genre, while keeping their rock sounds.\nThey gained popularity in Japan with the support of Yoshiki from the popular Japanese rock band X Japan, and they also remade \"Tears\" from the band. The newly remake song was included in their first album M.C the Max with the name \"See You Later\". In addition, the second disc which was included with their first album consisted of songs entirely written and composed by the members themselves, which displays the members' musical abilities. Although the band still had the strong \"Moon Child\" image, through the resurgence under a new name, M.C the Max was building an image of a talented band.\nIn December 2003, M.C the Max made their comeback with their second full-length album Love Is Time Sixth Sense. The title track \"Love Poem\" was composed by the frontman of Anzen Chitai, Kōji Tamaki. The new album will be released and sold simultaneously with Anzen Chitai's album. The album was met with great success and appealing to many Koreans, as M.C the Max won for the first time since debut on music programs. They won a total of 7 trophies with the title track and 2 triple crowns (winning consecutively for 3 times) on music programs such as the then Music Camp (the current Show! Music Core, and Inkigayo.\n\n\n=== 2004–2005: Solitude Love, The Rusted Love, and In Search for Love ===\nThe following year, they released their third full-length album Solitude Love on November 18, 2004. The title track \"Don't Be Happy\" was composed by a singer-songwriter in Japan, Kohmi Hirose who released the million-selling single Romance no Kamisama. Their 3rd album consisted of several songs of the ballad genre than before. However, a situation where members Jeon Min-hyuk and J. Yoon did not want to enter (preparation) sessions since the release of their second full-length album in 2003 was revealed. M.C the Max members then lost their desire to continue activities, forcing their widening activities to be stopped abruptly. Despite this, M.C the Max won an additional 5 trophies and another triple crown with their title track on more music programs such as M! Countdown.\nEven though the promotional activities for their third full-length album were stopped abruptly, that did not deter them from releasing a new album in 2005. They made a comeback after a year with their fourth full-length album The Rusted Love on November 23, 2005 and the title track \"사랑은 아프려고 하는 거죠\" (loosely translated to Love Is Going to be Painful) won another 5 trophies on music programs.\nThe members then expanded their entertainment activity rather than releasing mainstream music. They ventured into contributing soundtracks for dramas and also releasing a compilation album. Most notably, they released the soundtrack \"사랑하고 있네요\" for the television series Which Star Are You From, and also released the compilation album In Search for Love. At the end of 2006, the members' contracts with Paramount Entertainment expired. As they did not own the band name, Paramount Entertainment tried to debut \"M.C the Max 2\" and member Lee Soo as a solo singer, independent from the group.\nLee Soo had objected to the decision, stating that \"Unless this group consists of the 3 of us, we will not be able to release any music. The M.C in M.C the Max stands for Moon Child, and for the three of us only.\" which was against the policy of Paramount Entertainment. They then left the agency and signed a contract with a new agency named Vitamin Entertainment. However, Paramount Entertainment stated that they possessed the rights to the name M.C the Max until 2014, and had plans to add legal restrictions on the use of the name. After which, they filed a lawsuit for the name rights. Meanwhile, while the lawsuit was ongoing, M.C the Max was planning to release \"볼때기 사랑\", a song which they had recorded earlier. Later on, they released the song together with the digital single \"The Perfect Ballad\".\nLee Soo also released the soundtrack \"나만의 슬픔\" which was a remake song original sung by Kim Don-kyu for the musical drama \"동화\". In late 2006, the court made a decision in favour of M.C the Max, and Paramount Entertainment had to retract their decision to debut \"M.C the Max 2\". M.C the Max also claimed ownership for the four full-length albums they've released under the agency up till now.\n\n\n=== 2007–2008: Returns, VIA 6, and Unlimited ===\nM.C the Max then made a surprise announcement that they will release their fifth full-length album Returns on April 18, 2007. The album consists of songs that goes beyond the different types of ballad and traditional rock sounds. They stated that one of the few factors was to break the perception that M.C the Max was a ballad band. After the release of their fifth full-length album, M.C the Max also planned on releasing another repackaged album to meet their fans twice through album promotions. After the promotional activities for their album has been completed, Lee Soo also worked with the vocalist of Rumble Fish, Choi Jin-yi on the duet \"Requiem\".\nTogether with Choi Jin-yi, they also started working on Lee Soo's solo album \"I Am\" which was to be released in May 2008. Both J. Yoon and Jeon Min-hyuk also participated in the preparation sessions. J. Yoon and Davink was also active in project activities, being part of the electronica project band Monotonik. J. Yoon also collaborated with Shin Hae-chul who had produced their first album under the name Moon Child and their upcoming fifth full-length album to form the project group \"Wittgenstein\".\nAmong news of the members' solo and project activities, rumours that M.C the Max also began to spread. However, M.C the Max had squashed the rumours as they announced they were making their comeback with the release of their sixth full-length album VIA 6 on September 30, 2008 after a year and 5 months. To commemorate the release of their sixth full-length album, M.C the Max also announced that they were going on a national cpncert tour titled Eclipse around Korea.\nThey would begin their tour starting in Yonsei University in Seoul on October 18, before moving on to Seongnam Arts Center on November 8. This will be followed by the KBS Hall in Busan on November 15, before concluding in Daegu Health College in Daegu on December 20. They then became active in promotional activities with the title track off their sixth full-length album, \"Unbeknown to Tears\". On December 10, 2008, they also released a repackaged album in pictorial format titled Unlimited. They had originally produced 10,000 copies of the pictorial album, but due to high demands, they produced another 10,000 copies of the album.\n\n\n=== 2009–2012: Military enlistment, Rewind & Remind, and hiatus ===\nIn 2009, M.C the Max released the live album \"Moonchild Is Invincible\" which contained the songs sung live in the 2007 concert of the same name. On June 13 and 14, M.C the Max members held their final concert titled \"Goodbye for a moment\" at Yonsei University before their military enlistment. A few days later on June 18, during the free time between their final concert and the date of their military enlistment, they released the special album \"Rewind & Remind\" online. The special album will also be made available at music stores on June 23.\nOn June 25, Lee Soo started his military service by enlisting as a public servant and entered the training camp. About a month later on July 27, Jeon Min-hyuk also followed and enlisted as part of the Republic of Korea Air Force. For J. Yoon, he had entered the training camp on September 17 but in the middle of training, he had sustained injuries during a concert in 2008 so he was forced to give up US citizenship and was also serving as a public service personnel.\nIn the middle of military service, M.C the Max also dropped a single album \"So Sick\". In late 2011, the members' military service has ended and they were discharged from the training camp. They held another year-end solo concert at Yongsan Art Hall from December 29 to 31, and released the soundtracks for the TV Chosun television series Korean Peninsula, as well as the television series The King's Doctor. They parted ways with Vitamin Entertainment and joined their current agency, Music&NEW.\n\n\n=== 2014–2015: Unveiling ===\nM.C the Max made their comeback in about 5 years with the release of their seventh full-length album Unveiling on January 2.

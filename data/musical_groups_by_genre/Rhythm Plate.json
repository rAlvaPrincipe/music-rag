In 2012, they played their first live gig at Fabric using extensive outboard gear; including a Roland Juno 60, a Minimoog Model D, a Korg DW-8000, various effects and mixers and two Yamaha samplers. In 2013, Rhythm Plate started a new 'vinyl only' record label called Pressed For Time Records which, despite its lack of paid publicity/PR machine interest, each of the releases have been well received by the deep/tech house community of DJs It still releases music today.\nRhythm Plate released their first, and only, studio album Off The Charts in September 2013.

    "text": "The Marching Tar Heels is the marching band of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Known as \"The Pride of the ACC\", the Marching Tar Heels is one of the largest organizations at UNC with over 290 students.  The band plays at all home football games as well as travels to away games, usually as a small pep band.  However, the entire band travels to one away football game each year, usually staying close to home. These have included trips to universities such as NC State and East Carolina but have also included some longer trips to venues such as Notre Dame in 2006 and the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game in 2010 and 2016. On August 27th 2022, the band performed with the Marching 100 of Florida A&M University.\nThe UNC band was formed in 1903 and had their first performance at a UNC baseball game in 1904. The band first started traveling to away athletic events in 1905.  The band continues to play for multiple sports including men's and women's soccer, volleyball, men's and women's lacrosse, women's basketball and field hockey.  The band also divides into two smaller bands and plays at all men's basketball home games, as well as sending a pep band to tournament games. \nThe band is currently under the direction of Jeffrey Fuchs.\n\n\n== Traditions ==\nSeveral traditions have amassed over the years which include:\n\nThe Blue and White Warm-Up Chorale is played before every performance by the Marching Tar Heels. It was written by former band members, Joshua Potter and Ryan Ripperton.\nOn football gameday, it has become tradition for the drumline to warm-up (usually in or near The Pit, in the center of campus) before joining the rest of the band for the march to the stadium. The drumline goes through warm-ups, show music, and cadences. It has become a crowd favorite, attracting large crowds at Tar Heel Town.\nAlso on football gameday, the trumpets and tubas perform \"Carolina Victory\" on the steps of Dey Hall one hour and five minutes before kickoff.\nDirectly before the march to Kenan Stadium, the band has a \"throwdown\" about that day's opponent. Seniors re-write the words to the military cadence of \"I don't know, but I've been told\" and the band recites the verses as a build-up to the drumline cadence.\nThe march to the stadium is a parade route that begins in front of Wilson Library, and ends with the march into the stadium.  During the march, the drumline plays through their cadences as the rest of the band does choreographed dances to each cadence.\nIt has become tradition that the drumline finish each rehearsal with a final beat of each drum in unison. The drum captain gives 4 clicks on his rim and the rest of the drumline responds with a beat.\nAfter the football team makes a defensive stop on 3rd down, the band plays Raise Up.\n\n\n== Traditional songs ==\n\nThe Marching Tar Heels regularly play these songs at athletic events.\n\nHark The Sound (Alma Mater)\nHere Comes Carolina\nI'm a Tar Heel Born (Tag)\nCarolina Victory\nTar Heels On Hand\nCarolina Fight Song (Fight Song)\nUNC Vamp\nCarolina in My Mind\nSweet Caroline\nAye!

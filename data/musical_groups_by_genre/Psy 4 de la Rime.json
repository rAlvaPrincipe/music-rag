    "text": "Psy 4 de la Rime (French pronunciation: [psi kat(ʁ) də la ʁim]) are a French hip hop band formed 1995 in Marseille comprising several rappers with immigrant backgrounds from former French colonies. Their original name was KDB, Kid Dog Black. The band was signed to 361 Records, a Marseille-based independent label founded by fellow rapper Akhenaton. The group had three albums, the debut Block Party (2002), Enfants de la lune (2005) and Les cités d'or (2008). After split, members particularly Soprano and Alonzo went on to have very successful solo careers with their own albums and single hits. The formation got together in 2013 to release a fourth album called 4eme Dimension that made to number 3 on the French Albums Chart.\n\n\n== Formation and beginnings (1995–2001) ==\nThe group formed under the name of KDB (Kids Dog Black) in 1995, in Plan d'Aou in the northern districts of Marseille, in the Bouches-du-Rhône. The group begins with the scene, in particular in the first part of groups like the Sages Poètes de la Rue, the Fonky Family or the DJ Cut Killer. Thereafter, they will be brought to work with the Sad Hill Records label and get closer to DJ Kheops. From 1998, they madevarious titles on the soundtracks of films such as Zonzon by Laurent Bouhnikor Like a magnet with Akhenaton and Kamel Saleh at the helm, but also on the compilations Vague Nocturne, La Cosca, Time Bomb, Groove 100% Marseille hip hop, Sad Hill Impact, Turntable Dragun'z and Sur un air positive. Armed with these first experiences, the four rappers got down to their first album, Block Party, which was released in March 2002.\n\n\n== Solo careers of members ==\nEven before the split-up, some of the individual rappers in the band have continued their solo careers. \n\nMost notable of them was Soprano who had already released a solo album while in the band titled Puisqu'il faut vivre that had made it to #2 in the SNEP French Albums Chart. His album La Colombe released in 2010 has even topped the French Albums Chart, with the follow-up 2011 album Le Corbeau making to number 3 on the same chart. In 2012 he had a joint album with R.E.D.K. titled E=2MC's making it to number 6 and a solo album Cosmopolitanie reaching number 2 in 2014. Soprano has had ten singles reach the Top 20 of the French Singles charts, including \"Cosmo\", \"Fresh Prince\", and \"Le Diable ne s'habille plus en Prada\" cracking the Top 10.\nIn similar fashion, Segnor Alonzo has continued to enjoy a good career under the shortened name Alonzo releasing three albums of his own starting with his 2009 solo album Un dernier coup d'œil dans le rétroviseur immediately after the split-up followed by the successful and critically acclaimed Les temps modernes in 2010, Amour, gloire & cité in 2012 making it to number 9 and the hugely successful Règlement de comptes reaching number 2 in the French Albums Chart.\nSya Styles continued to collaborate in a number of productions including with IAM, Freeman and DJ Abdel. On 26 October 2015, DJ Sya Styles, the DJ of the formation died of illness. He was 37. Soprano said it would be impossible to release a \"Psy4 with 3 members\" album, meaning an album without Sya Styles.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\nLive albums\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site (En)\n361 Records\nListen to Psy4 De La Rime's discography"

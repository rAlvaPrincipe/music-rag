In June that year they released their remix for The Nervo Twins entitled \"This Kind of Love\" for Onelove Records. In November 2010 they provided a remix for a track by Danny Freakazoid and Matt Caseli, \"Sign Your Name\", which borrowed heavily from Terence Trent D'Arby's 1988 hit of the same name. The remix version was released through Axtone and Neon Records.\nOn 26 March 2011, Feenixpawl issued their second single, \"Seasons\", which was remixed by Syke N Sugastarr, Ben Morris and Venuto, Bobby Vena and Nick Galea. \"Seasons\" spent 14 weeks in the ARIA Club Charts Top 50 and peaked at No. 7.\nIn April 2011, they released their EP, Clockwerk / Xylophone, with Neon Records. By mid-2011 the duo produced a bootleg of the Adele track, \"Rolling in the Deep\" which gained international recognition.\nIn January 2012, Feenixpawl's fifth single, \"In My Mind\", was released on Axtone Records. It is a collaboration with producer, Ivan Gough, from dance music duo, TV Rock, and featured the singer, Georgi Kay. \"In My Mind\" peaked at No. 29 on the ARIA Singles Chart, it spent 11 weeks at No. 1 on the ARIA Club Tracks, and also reached No. 1 on the iTunes Dance Charts. On the Dutch Singles Chart it peaked at No. 51.\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 2012, in December 2012, the duo, Ivan Gough and Georgi Kay, won the ARIA award for Best Dance Release for \"In My Mind\". At the APRA Music Awards of 2013, Forté and Soon won Dance Work of the Year for that track, which was shared with fellow songwriters, Gough and Kay.\nIn April 2015, the duo helped launch the EDM imprint of Wind-Up Records, Eclypse Records. The label's first release, Feenixpawl's \"Ghosts\" (featuring Melissa Ramsay), reached number 16 on the Billboard Dance Charts.

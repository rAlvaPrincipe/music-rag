That performance on October 1, 2011, was by the orchestra's principal clarinetist, Douglas Monroe, conducted by Platt. \nThe orchestra maintains close ties with arts patrons, the business community, local educators, and the University of North Dakota for its supporters, its audience, and its musicians.\n\n\n== External links ==\nGreater Grand Forks Symphony Orchestra website"

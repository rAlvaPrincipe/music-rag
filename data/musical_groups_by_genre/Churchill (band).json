The group self-released a self-titled EP in 2009 and a full-length titled Happy/Sad in 2011. They originally released their second EP, entitled Change in early 2012. The band signed with A&M/Octone Records later that year, after which they re-released Change. The EP reached #9 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. The title track became a hit single, reaching #17 on the Alternative Songs chart and was an iTunes Free Song of the Week in early 2013.

    "text": "The Spartans Drum and Bugle Corps is an Open Class competitive junior drum and bugle corps. Based in Nashua, New Hampshire, the Spartans performs in Drum Corps International (DCI) competitions. The Spartans won the DCI Division II World Championship in 1997, 1998, 2004, 2005, 2007, and in 2019, 2023, and 2024 won the DCI Open Class Championship that replaced Divisions II and III in 2008.\n\n\n== History ==\nSource:\nThe Spartans Drum and Bugle Corps was founded in 1955 by Albert LaFlamme. LaFlamme was succeeded as corps director by his son, Peter. Today, the corps is run by Albert's grandson, Paul LaFlamme.\nA fire in 1999 destroyed nearly everything the corps owned: instruments, uniforms, equipment, vehicles. The dedication of the corps' members, staff, and supporters, as well as the greater drum corps community, kept the corps in operation and in competition, with the corps placing second that year at DCI Division II Finals in Madison, Wisconsin.\nDespite being DCI Division II Champions five times, in 2009 the economic downturn forced the Spartans into bankruptcy. Bingo revenues had dropped off to a point where the corps discontinued that fundraising activity. Efforts to sell the corps hall had not been successful. The corps went through a year of inactivity and reorganized, including a change of management and sale of the corps hall. The corps then successfully returned to competition in 2010.\nSince returning to the DCI competition field in 2010, the Spartans have never placed outside the top 5 in the Open Class championship. The corps has also qualified for World Class semi finals consecutively since 2012, regularly finishing above a number of World Class corps.\nIn 2019, ten years after the corps went inactive, the Spartans were crowned the champions of the 2019 DCI Open Class World Championship with a score of 81.050. They were also the only corps to go undefeated throughout the regular season before world finals week. This was repeated in 2023 and 2024 when the Spartans were consecutively crowned undefeated Open Class World Champions.\n\n\n== Sponsorship ==\nThe Spartans Drum and Bugle Corps is a registered non-profit 501(c)(3) musical organization. The president of the organization is Paul \"PG\" LaFlamme Jr. and the corps director is Anthony Montesion.\n\n\n== Show summary (1972â€“2024) ==\nSource:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

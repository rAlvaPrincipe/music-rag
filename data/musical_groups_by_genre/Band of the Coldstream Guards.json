    "text": "The Band of the Coldstream Guards is one of the oldest and best known bands in the British Army, having been officially formed on 16 May 1785 under the command of Major C F Eley.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band of the Coldstream Guards was officially formed under the direction of Music Major C.F. Eley on 16 May 1785.\nThe band received its first British bandmaster in 1835, Charles Godfrey.\nOn 18 June 1944 over one hundred twenty people were killed at Wellington Barracks when a German flying bomb hit the chapel. The director of the band was amongst the dead, prompting the appointment of Captain Douglas Alexander Pope.\nIn 1985, during the band's two hundredth anniversary year, the Coldstream Guards kicked off the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium, performing \"a fanfare composed by the Director of Music Lt Col Richard Ridings\".\nTwo especially unusual performances took place in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks in the United States. On September 12, 2001, Queen Elizabeth II broke with tradition and allowed the Coldstream Guards Band to perform The Star-Spangled Banner at Buckingham Palace, London, during the daily ceremonial Changing of the Guard. The following day at a St. Paul's Cathedral memorial service, the Queen herself joined in the singing of the American national anthem, an unprecedented occurrence. The Coldstream Guards played The Star-Spangled Banner again at Windsor Castle on the 20th anniversary of 9/11.\n\n\n== Ensembles ==\nThere are several ensembles within the Band of the Coldstream Guards:\n\nConcert Band\nMarching Band\nBrass Quintet\nJazz Trio\nFanfares\n\nWoodwind Quintet\n18th Century Band\n\n\n== Functions ==\n\nThe Coldstream Guards Band plays regularly for many events as part of the  Massed Bands of the Household Division. Selected occasions that are most famous include:\n\nBeating Retreat\nChanging of the Guard\nThe Festival of Remembrance\nTrooping the Colour\nInvestitures\nState visits\n\n\n== Album and Record Deal ==\n\nIn June 2009 the band signed a record deal with Universal Music imprint Decca, reportedly worth Â£1 million. Their debut album 'Heroes' was released on 30 November 2009 and was nominated for Best Album of the Year for Classical Brits. The Band of the Coldstream Guards performed at the Classical Brits Awards gala at the Royal Albert Hall.\n\n\n== In media ==\nIn the closing credits of Dad's Army, the band played a instrumental march version of the theme tune, Who Do You Think You Are Kidding, Mr Hitler?, conducted by Captain (later Lieutenant Colonel) Trevor L. Sharpe.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrenadier Guards Band\nIrish Guards Band\nScots Guards Band\nWelsh Guards Band\nHousehold Division\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome of Coldstream Guards Band\nBand History Archived 2008-06-07 at the Wayback Machine\nFormer personnel website\nThe Band of the Coldstream Guards, Sarah's Music on YouTube"

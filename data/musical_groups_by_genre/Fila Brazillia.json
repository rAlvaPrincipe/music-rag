    "text": "Fila Brazillia is an English electronica duo from Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, England, formed in 1990 by Steve Cobby and David McSherry.\n\n\n== History ==\nTheir early albums were released on Pork Recordings, also based in Hull: Old Codes New Chaos, Maim That Tune, Mess, Black Market Gardening, Luck Be a Weirdo Tonight and Power Clown. After creating their own music label with Sim Lister, Twentythree Records, they released further albums A Touch of Cloth, Jump Leads, The Life And Times of Phoebus Brumal, Dicks and Retrospective.\nThey have also released two DJ mix albums, Another Late Night: Fila Brazillia, for Azuli Records' \"Another Late Night\" series, and Another Fine Mess: Fila Brazillia, and two collections of remixes: Brazilification and B2.\nTheir collaborations include working with Harold Budd and Bill Nelson to release Three White Roses & A Budd (Twentythree Records, 2002).\nThey co-produced the first Twilight Singers LP Twilight as Played by The Twilight Singers with Greg Dulli in 2001.\nCobby and McSherry have produced more than 70 remixes for artists including Black Uhuru, Busta Rhymes, DJ Food, Lamb, Radiohead and The Orb.\nBill Hicks, the controversial American stand-up comedian, satirist and social critic, \"appears\" on Fila Brazillia's album Maim That Tune (1996) and the album is dedicated to Hicks.\nTheir music has made its mark both on small-screen blockbusters (such as CSI and Sex and the City) and cult cinema films such as Dogtown and Z-Boys, Riding Giants and Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos, a 2006 documentary about the New York Cosmos soccer team.\nOne of their better-known songs, A Zed and two L's, appears on Jam, a black comedy sketch show by British satirist Chris Morris.\nTheir song \"Here Comes Pissy Willy\" from the Power Clown album featured as the theme to the James Whale Show on Talk Radio in the late 1990s.\nAfter releasing their Retrospective album in 2006, Cobby and McSherry quietly ended their longtime partnership. Currently, McSherry is a lecturer in Sound and Music Production at the University of Lincoln.\nCobby went on in late 2006 to form Steel Tiger Records with Sim Lister. Over the course of 2007, the label saw various digital releases by J*S*T*A*R*S (Cobby and Lister), Peacecorps (Cobby and guitarist Rich Arthurs) and by The Cutler (Cobby and ex-head of Pork Recordings David \"Porky\" Brennand).\nThe first formal album by The Cutler on Steel Tiger Records was released on 7 July 2008, and the most recent \"Everything Is Touching Everything Else\" (Steel Tiger Records ST016, 10 June 2013) – with vocals by Isobel Helen, Archie Heselwood, Andrew Taylor and Little Glitches – distributed by Kudos Records Ltd.\nIn 2013 Steve Cobby provided the soundtrack for the Hull 'UK City of Culture 2017' bid film - 'This City Belongs to Everyone', produced by Nova Studios - on 20 November 2013 Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, was announced as the winning City, and so as UK City of Culture 2017.\nAfter a 16 year hiatus, on 6 March 2020, the band returned with the release of the MMXX EP.\nIn 2023, they appear to have released the Subtle Body album/EP, with two original tracks and two unreleased versions.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nOld Codes New Chaos (1994)\nMaim That Tune (1995)\nMess (1996)\nBlack Market Gardening (1996)\nLuck Be a Weirdo Tonight (1997)\nPower Clown (1998)\nA Touch of Cloth (1999)\nJump Leads (2002)\nThe Life and Times of Phoebus Brumal (2004)\nDicks (2004)\nSubtle Body (International Feel, 2023)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nMermaids (Pork Recordings, 1991)\nRankine (Pork Recordings, 1992)\nFila Funk/Rankine (Live At Bounce) (Pork Recordings, 1993)\nPots & Pans/The Sheriff (Pork Recordings, 1993)\nSlacker (Pork Recordings, 1994)\nA Zed & Two L’s/Harmonicas Are Shite (Pork Recordings, 1995)\nSoft Music Under Stars/Blood (Pork Recordings, 1996)\nWigs, Bifocals And Nurishment (Pork Recordings, 1997)\nThe Speewah/Feathery Legs (Pork Recordings, 1998)\nBovine Funk/Here Comes Pissy Willy (Pork Recordings, 1998)\nThrowing Down A Shape (Pork Recordings, 1998)\nFB@V&A (Pork Recordings, 2001)\nFila Brazillia Versus A Certain Ratio (Pork Recordings, 2003)\nFila Brazillia Remix Beef Wellington & DJ Razor (Pork Recordings, 2003)\nThe Goggle Box (Pork Recordings, 2004)\nNeanderthal (Twentythree Records, 2007)\nOne Track Mind (Twentythree Records, 2007)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nSycot Motion (Mindfood, 1996)\nRidden Pony (Pork Recordings, 1999)\nBitten Bugs (Pork Recordings, 1999)\nSpill The Beans (Pork Recordings, 2001)\nThree White Roses & A Budd (with Harold Budd and Bill Nelson) (Twentythree Records, 2002 – recorded 2000)\nSaucy Joints (Twentythree Records, 2002)\nWe Build Arks (Twentythree Records, 2002)\nOne Track Mind (Twentythree Records, 2007)\nMMXX (Twentythree Records, 2020)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nMusic for Freelance (1999)\nRetrospective (Twentythree Records, 2006)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nBrazilification (Remixes 95–99) (Kudos, 1999)\n21 Brazilliant Remixes (B2) (Twentythree Records, 2003)\nSoul Sauce on Verve Remixed 2 (Verve Music Group, 2003)\n\n\n=== DJ mix albums ===\nAnother Late Night: Fila Brazillia (2001)\nAnother Fine Mess: Fila Brazillia (2004)\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Fila Brazillia, album review – Jump Leads\" by Frank Tope, The Guardian, 8 February 2002, retrieved 16 Feb 2008\n\"The ultimate summer mix – Europe's hottest dance festivals\" by Matt Munday, The Guardian, 1 June 2002, retrieved 16 Feb 2008\n\"The BBC Collective – Editor's Review – 'The Sound of Brazil, by way of Hull' – interview with Fila Brazillia\" by Paul Clark, BBC, 22 August 2002, retrieved 16 Feb 2008\n\"Fila Brazillia (Sonar 97) – DJmag.com's guide to the history of the Sonar Festival, Spain\" DJmag.com, 2007, retrieved 16 Feb 2008\n\"Fila Brazillia, Fabric, London – live performance review\" by Pascal Wyse, The Guardian, 19 September 2000, retrieved 16 Feb 2008\n\"Hull's City of Culture bid film revealed to the public\" BBC News article,12 November 2013\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMixmag article featuring Fila Brazillia - Note: Domain Parked as of 16 January 2015 Archived 19 December 2005 at the Wayback Machine\nFila Brazillia Discography\nFila Brazillia at IMDb"

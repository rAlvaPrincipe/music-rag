    "text": "The Jive Aces are a six-piece UK-based, swing band that was formed in 1989. They were Britain's Got Talent semi-finalists in 2012. They have released 11 albums, as well as compilations, EPs and singles and have performed at numerous music festivals.\nThe band was founded by vocalist Ian Clarkson, drummer Peter Howell (who went to school with Ian in Billericay), bassist Ken Smith and saxophonist \"Big\" John Fordham. The four met in East London jive and jazz clubs. They cut their teeth street entertaining and were soon being offered shows in UK and Europe. After several years of touring the band with various other musicians, the four met Alex Douglas (trombone, bongos, blues harp, washboard) and Vince Hurley (piano) who became permanent members. Grazia Clarkson, the band's publicist, has also become a regular performing member playing several featured songs on accordion.\nThe band is recognized as one of the top swing bands in the world, something borne out by their extensive international travel (the band has performed in over 40 countries). The June 2015 issue of Vintage Rock magazine described them as the \"UK's number one jive and swing band\".\nThey have received awards from Variety, the Children's Charity and the City of Derry International Music Award in 2006. On 12 September 2018 The Jive Aces won \"Best Band\" at the Boisdale Music Awards. The award was presented by Jools Holland, who then joined the band for a boogie woogie jam session.\nThe band is also notable for having strong links to the Church of Scientology as members of the Sea Organization, and for promoting the group and its missions.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Notable highlights ===\nOn 9 July 2010, the band headlined at the first ever swing dance at the Royal Albert Hall. They played to approximately 1,400 dancers on the 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) dance floor, with support from the Back To Basie Orchestra and Top Shelf Jazz.\nIn late August 2010, the Jive Aces performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in a show tributing one of their musical heroes, Louis Prima. In February 2011, after recording in Los Angeles, they toured the United States, including opening for legendary singer Keely Smith, the former wife of Louis Prima. Keely Smith has also sung with the band on a number of occasions, including shows in Los Angeles, Palm Desert, Phoenix and at the Edinburgh Fringe.\nThe band played London's famous jazz venue Ronnie Scotts for the first time in July 2011 and sold out. The band has since played there several times a year, selling out every time.\nIn Spring 2015, the band did their biggest tour to date, 6 weeks of major theatres around the US (mostly 1000-2000+ capacity). The tour was a huge success, with biannual USA tours every year since.\nOn 10 February 2019, the Jive Aces brought an expanded version of their Big Beat Revue tour to London's Aldwych Theatre. This is one of London's West End theatres (the UK equivalent of Broadway). The show, featuring special guests Cassidy Janson, BBC Radio London's Jo Good, The Satin Dollz, Antonio Socci and Lottie B, was sold out and received standing ovations.\n\n\n=== Viral video \"Bring Me Sunshine\" ===\nIn March 2011, the band produced a YouTube video for their cover of the Morecambe and Wise theme song \"Bring Me Sunshine\", in a Louis Prima, jive style. It went on to win several awards at film festivals, and a Silver Telly Award.  The video is noted for its uplifting quality and has even been prescribed by a US doctor for depression, as noted in national media. As of May 2019, the video has been viewed over 3.3 million times on YouTube.\n\n\n=== Britain's Got Talent ===\nIn January 2012 The Jive Aces auditioned for Britain's Got Talent, with the audition airing on week 6 on 28 April 2012, performing the band's version of The Jungle Book classic, \"I Wanna Be Like You\".

In 2013 the band played 4 shows at Buckingham Palace for The Coronation Festival, the first ever public festival inside the grounds of the palace.\n\n\n=== Glastonbury and other festivals ===\nIn May 2015 it was announced that The Jive Aces would perform on the Avalon Stage at the world-famous Glastonbury Festival. This was the band's second appearance at Glastonbury, but their first on the Avalon Stage. The band's set was considered a highlight of this year's festival and a short clip of a mid-set keyboard collapse and speedy recovery by pianist Hurley went viral with online features in the Mirror (who called Hurley \"Brilliantly committed\" and \"a hero of Glastonbury\") and Telegraph.\nThe band has also appeared at numerous major festivals including Lovebox, Montreux, Hop Farm Festival, Bearded Theory, Ascona, North Sea Jazz, Jazz a Montauban, Bansko Jazz Cork Jazz, Lunel Jazz, Klaipeda Jazz, Edinburgh Fringe, Viva Las Vegas and even in Thailand.\nThe Jive Aces have also performed at many special events including the London Olympics at Trafalgar Square, both Conservative Party and TUC Conferences and for a crowd of 15,000 at the \"Moonwalk \" cancer charity fundraising walk in London.\nThe Jive Aces returned to Glastonbury Festival in 2017, with an appearance on the prestigious Acoustic Stage.\n\n\n=== \"The Jive Aces Big Beat Revue\", The Aldwych Theatre and theatre tours ===\nThe band initially played mostly at clubs and dancehalls, but their theatricality and showmanship has also led to them performing in more and more theatres, both in UK and USA. Notable tours include \"Swingtime\", \"Jump, Jive & Wail\", \"Swingin' The Holidays\" and \"Jazz Meets Jive\" (with the late Kenny Ball).\nin Spring 2019 the band launched its \"Jive Aces Big Beat Revue\" tour, with a sold-out show at London's Aldwych Theatre.

Over the years it has featured many well known jazz and roots performers including Keely Smith, Cassidy Janson, Kenny Ball, Acker Bilk, Laurie London, Chas McDevitt, Gunhild Carling, Gina Haley and Ray Gelato. Between 2017 and 2019 the event has raised Â£17,000 for charities including The Not Forgotten Association.\nIn 2017 it was featured as one of the Daily Telegraph's \"30 nostalgic days out to try this Summer\".\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nThe Jive Aces have featured many guest artists on their recordings, including Chick Corea, Kenny Ball, Mark Isham, Ray Gelato, Mr Acker Bilk, Toni Elizabeth Prima, The Satin Dollz, The Flirtinis, Rebecca Grant, and The Three Belles.\nIn live performance the band has worked with Van Morrison, Keely Smith, John Travolta, Kenny Ball (with whom they worked extensively on the Jazz Meets Jive theatre tour 2010-12) and since 2014 have been featuring West End star and Olivier Award winner Cassidy Janson (Wicked, Avenue Q, Dessa Rose, Beautiful, etc.) as guest singer at many shows.\n\n\n=== JiveStream ===\nOn 17 March 2020, one week prior to the Coronavirus lockdown, The Jive Aces started a one-hour daily livestream on Facebook to keep in contact with their fans while unable to perform live. This show rapidly developed from a simple iPhone broadcast early on to a fully professional set up with high quality camera with multiple cameras and regular sections of the show such as \"Celebrity Call-in\" (featuring the likes of Len Goodman, Kevin J McNally, Cassidy Janson, Ray Gelato and Diane Keen), \"Italian Time\" (featuring resident Italian Grazia with dedications and more), \"Favourite Things\" (asking viewers to send in their positive experiences with the lockdown) and \"Competition Time\". In August 2020 the band put on a special Summertime Swing edition of JiveStream, when the event itself had to be cancelled. Friends such as Cassidy Janson, Ray Gelato, Gina Haley, Gunhild Carling and Peter Donegan contributed live performances and helped raise hundreds of pounds for The Not Forgotten, one of the band's favorite charities.\nThe show was expected to run for three weeks, but on 16 March 2021 the Jive Aces celebrated a full year of the JiveStream after racking up 365 consecutive episodes. The show went on to run for 500 consecutive days before cutting down to a less regular basis as the band started returning to live performance.

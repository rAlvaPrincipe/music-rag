    "text": "The Sacramento State Marching Band (SSMB) is the official marching band at California State University, Sacramento. To this day the band performs at all home football games and various away games during the football season. The SSMB also functions as the de facto student cheering section at athletic events, as it is the largest and loudest spirit organization of Sacramento State's campus. The SSMB also is present every year during the Causeway Classic against its arch-rival: UC Davis.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe SSMB was formed in 1955 and was known as the Sacramento State Marching Musicians under the direction of Dr. Norman J. Hunt. Ronald Holloway was the second director from the mid 1960's until 1981. He retired in 1992 and is now Professor Emeritus. In 1981, Dr. Jack Foote took the title of director and his leadership lasted until 1995. Dr. Foote is now Professor Emeritus within the university's School of Music and has been inducted into the SSMB Hall of Fame.\nDr. Jeffrey Edom (unofficially dubbed the \"Edom Era\") began in 1996 and concluded in 2007. During this era, Dr. Edom oversaw the exponential growth of the band from 37 members to 100 members, designed two of the band's uniforms, and established the first Sacramento State Winter Drumline. He also changed the name of the band to what it is known as today. Dr. Edom was inducted into the SSMB Hall of Fame on October 24, 2021.\nDr. Clay Redfield took over after Dr. Edom in 2008 where he was (at one point) simultaneously the Director of Bands, Director of Marching & Athletic Bands, and Professor of Education. He resigned from his position of athletic bands director in 2018 and currently still works within the School of Music as the Professor of Education.\nMr. Santiago A. Sabado began his reign in 2018 as the up-and-coming young band director. His skill in budgeting, recruiting, scheduling, and overall impressive organization of the position brought the band's membership to an all-time high of 187 as of 2022. On August 6, 2021, the SSMB welcomed a new Assistant Director of Athletic Bands to the team, Mr. Christopher Langton. Mr. Sabado and Mr. Langton together would run the marching band for the next two years; maintaining partnerships with Mandarins Drum and Bugle Corps to provide with food, transportation, and extra instruments to the band. During Mr. Sabado's 2022 season, he coined the saying \"Build the Empire! Take over the World!\" that would be echoed by the band whenever shouted by him. Unfortunately, due to avoidable circumstances, Santiago Sabado would resign from the program immediately following the 2022 season. Christopher Langton would continue to guide the Pep Band, Trash Band, and Sac State Indoor groups during the 2023 spring season.\nDr. James Long became the SSMB director in August 2023 but has resigned his position in July 2024.\n\n\n== Membership ==\nAlthough it the group is primarily composed of students who attend Sacramento State, the SSMB welcomes all who are interested in devoting their time to the group. Those who are not enrolled at Sacramento State are permitted into the band as volunteers. These volunteers typically range from high school students preparing to take the step into college lifeâ€”or students enrolled in various other colleges (i.e. community colleges) who may or may not have an existing athletics bands program. Volunteers must be pre-approved as a university volunteer beforehand.\nThere are no auditions required for members interested in playing a woodwind or brasswind instrument. There are, however, required placement auditions for those interested in joining the battery, color guard, or front ensemble.\nSacramento State students who are enrolled in the SSMB are provided with priority registration for the Spring and Fall semesters following their commitment to the band in the immediately previous season.\n\n\n== The Pep Band ==\nThe Sacramento State Hornet Revue (better known as the Sacramento State Pep Band) is the smaller subset of the marching band and usually performs as the official pep band. The Hornet Revue performs at home volleyball and basketball games that take place in Yosemite Hall's \"The Hive\" court and at Golden 1 Center for the basketball Causeway Classic between Sacramento State Hornets and UC Davis Aggies.\n\n\n== The Soccer Trash Band ==\nOn August 13, 2021, the SSMB debuted a new branch to their spirit groups under the name \"Trash Band\" (or \"Trash Gig\"). This spirit group consists of steel trash cans, plastic buckets, bass drums, and cheering to create all kinds of noise at the Hornet Soccer Field for the Men's and Women's Hornet Soccer Teams.\n\n\n== Traditions ==\n\n\n=== Marching Style ===\nThe Sacramento State Marching Band marches the straight-leg glide step style.\n\n\n=== The Rivalry ===\nThe SSMB strives to keep the Sacramento State Hornets and UC Davis Aggies rivalry alive; which is highlighted each year at the annual Causeway Classic.\n\n\n==== Trooping ====\nTrooping is a tradition of the SSMB performed usually during game days, parade performances, or other school functions. The SSMB marches in parade block formation usually accompanied by the color guard along with Sacramento State Cheer Team and Dance Team. During Trooping, the battery plays its signature \"Rumble\" cadence and the band stops and plays for tailgaters prior to home football games.\n\n\n=== Repertoire ===\nThe band's musical repertoire consists of various classic rock, jazz, funk, grunge, metal, Latin and pop tunes, as well as the school's fight song, \"Fight Hornet Fight\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nUniversity of Montana Grizzly Marching Band (Another Big Sky Conference marching band)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSacramento State Marching Band Homepage"

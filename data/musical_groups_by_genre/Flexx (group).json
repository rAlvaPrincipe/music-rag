    "text": "Flexx is a Swedish Eurodance group, formed in 1993 by Swedish rappers Chris Ljung and Malvern Mandengu. Same year, Ljung and Mandengu released their debut single, \"Wake Up\", which became a number four hit in Sweden and it also peaked at number 48 on the Eurochart Hot 100. The producers were Jan Nordlund and Johan Lagerlöf. The vocalist attracted Nana Hedin (known for the female vocal parts of E-Type). In 1994, they released 3 singles: \"Flexxible\", \"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\" and \"Runner-Up\". In the same year, an album Flexxibility was released. In most of the compositions, female vocals belong to Kajsa Mellgren. Kajsa left the Flexx team in 1995. Instead, they took the performer Silver.

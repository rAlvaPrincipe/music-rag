    "text": "B-Side Players is an American band formed in 1994. The band incorporates the sounds of Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico and Brazil with the funk, rock, jazz and hip-hop rhythms of their homeland. The band also drops a bit of Cumbia, gritty street Samba, Son Montuno and Jarocho into the mix. Described as War meets Lenny Kravitz by way of Ben Harper, the players have expanded their sound by playing with the likes of Harper, Ozomatli, The Wailers, James Brown, War and some of Cuba's best bands. They are signed to Jazz label Concord Music Group.\nKarlos \"Solrak\" Paez, the man behind the B-Side Players, grew up in a musical family. His father Ezequiel Paez is a trombone player and musical arranger who spent 17 years in Los Moonlights from Tijuana and 10 years in La Banda Del Recodo.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nRenacimiento (1997)\nCulture of Resistance (1999)\nMovement (2001)\nMaiz (2002)\nFire In The Youth (2007)\nRadio Afro Mexica (2009)\nRevolutionize (2012)\n\n\n== Current and Former Members ==\nKarlos \"Solrak\" Paez - vocals, guitar (founding member)\nSergio Hernández - bass (founding member)\nDamian DeRobbio - bass\nPaul Hernández - guitar\nLuis “The General” Cuenca - cymbals, drums, percussion and vocals\nReagan Branch - Sax\nVykki Milliman - flute\nRobert Sánchez - keyboard\nJosh Hernández - drums\nJoaquin Hernández - drums\nGerry Guevara - bass\nEmmanuel Alarcon - lead guitar, cuatro puertorriqueño, vocals\nAldo Perretta - charango, tres cubano, jarana veracruzana, ronrroco, cuatro venezolano, kena, zampoña\nRuss Gonzales - tenor sax\nBeto Perretta - drums, vocals\nMike Benge - Trombone\nRyan Moran - drums\nMichael Cannon - drums\nCamilo Moreno - congas and percussion\nJamal Siurano - alto sax\nKevin Nolan - trombone, trumpet\nAndy Krier - keyboards\nOmar Lopez - bass\njosiah McGinley - Sax\nGiovanni Mejia- Guitar\nFabio Alejo Rojas - Keyboards\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site"

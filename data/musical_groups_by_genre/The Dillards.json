This was a recurring role and the Dillards were led by veteran character actor Denver Pyle as their father and jug player, Briscoe Darling. Maggie Peterson played Charlene Darling, their sister and the focus for the attentions of character Ernest T. Bass, played by Howard Morris. As the Darling brothers, the band members spoke no dialogue and presented themselves as unemotional and disengaged unless they were performing a song. The appearances of the Dillards as the Darlings ran between 1963 and 1966. In 1986, the Dillards reprised the role in the reunion show Return to Mayberry. As part of their 2012 tour, Rodney Dillard answered questions about the TV series. He said the songs such as \"Dooley\" are about people the family knew.\nOn the October 1963 episode \"Briscoe Declares for Aunt Bee\", the Dillards performed the first wide scale airing of the 1955 Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith composition Feudin' Banjos (Dueling Banjos).\nAccording to Jim Clark of The Andy Griffith Show Rerun Watchers Club, three albums have been produced with songs performed on the show. Clark says \"Songs That Make Me Cry\" is the only one currently available with real performances and has the three songs which included Maggie Peterson as Charlene. \"Back Porch Bluegrass\" and \"Live Almost\" include five songs that were sung on the show, and Rodney Dillard released another album with the real performances of other songs.\n\n\n== Pioneering influences ==\nThe Dillards are notable for being among the first bluegrass groups to have electrified their instruments in the mid-1960s.  They are considered to be pioneers of country rock and progressive bluegrass. They are known to have directly or indirectly influenced artists such as the Eagles, the Byrds, and Elton John. In 1972, The Dillards joined Elton John on his first American tour. John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin has also acknowledged their influence, particularly in his decision to play the mandolin.\n\n\n== Current members ==\nRodney Dillard is a founding member of The Dillards – the group he formed with his brother, Douglas Dillard in the late 1950s. Credited throughout the years as the driving force behind the group's musical direction, success, and phenomenal longevity as a working act. Today, Dillard's musical duties include lead and harmony vocals, guitar, and dobro.\nBeverly Cotten-Dillard is a native of Morrisville, North Carolina who performed with Janette Carter, Ola Belle Reed, Tommy Jarrell, and Doc and Merle Watson. She has appeared on Hee Haw and the Disney Channel and at Carnegie Hall.

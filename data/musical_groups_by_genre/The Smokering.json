    "text": "The Smokering is a Los Angeles, California music production duo Ed Vichnick and Jason D. Kuhar.\nTheir music blends elements of downtempo, chill-out, hip hop, classical, dub, acid jazz, reggae, Indian classical, Middle Eastern, and ambient music.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Smokering was formed in January 2005.\nThey produced 4 studio albums that year: \n\"Escape From Van Nuys\", \"Fall Classic\", \"Poder A Le Gente\", and \"Tropicalifornia\".\nIn 2006 The Smokering released the classic, \"13\". Four additional albums were created that year, notably \"La La Land\", which yielded two of The Smokering's most well received songs, \"Freshoutdabox\" and \"Sativa\".\nOver the next year and a half Ed & JDK would work with a handful of established artists including Lumis James (Bazerk, Pigface),\nDavid \"Mavis\" Senescu (Cynic, ONLY), and bassist Ray Burke (Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden, Live After Death).\nIn 2007 \"Blacklight District\" was released. This album defined the duo and realized their distinct â€œsoundtrack\" vibe. They would record 2 more albums that year: \"The Motherboard Connection\" and \"Floatation Device\".\nBy 2008 the duo had transformed into group form with Lumis on turntables and vocals, Ray Burke on bass,\nand Leanna Burke & Larry Foster on percussion. This incarnation of The Smokering performed 4 shows that year.\nIn early 2009 The Smokering returned to the studio to create their 13th studio album, \"Colorformed\". Chillout, funk, trip hop, r&b, dub reggae, and even a touch of smooth jazz can be heard on this album.\nSeptember 2009 the compilation '05 - '09 was released digitally worldwide and features choice tracks from their first 13 albums.\nThe Smokering collaborated with Los Angeles based dj/emcee Lumis James on the track \"Before The World Was Digital\". It was recorded for \"Into The Vortex, Volume 2\", an IDM compilation released by Global Vortex Records in 2010. The song also aired on Los Angeles radio station 90.7FM KPFK's \"Breakbeats & Rhymes\" Radio Show on September 5, 2010.\nFall 2010 brought new music from The Smokering. The self-produced \"Mellow Majestic\" album offers a sophisticated blend of old school and nu-skool trip hop. The album was released on CD format and for digital download worldwide through the independent record label Global Vortex Records. The album received positive reviews from Hypnagogue.\nThe first installment of a new mixtape series by The Smokering, \"Adventures In Wi-Fi Vol. 1\" was released in Spring 2011.\nThe Smokering's first official e.p. \"Disco Balls\" was released worldwide on May 17, 2011.\nIn 2013, The Smokering signed with Chill Om Records India and released their latest album \"Morningstar\".\n\"Perceptions\", a previously unreleased song, was self-released and made available for download worldwide in 2014.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nEscape From Van Nuys (2005)\nFall Classic (2005)\nPoder A Le Gente (2005)\nTropicalifornia (2005)\nWorld War IV (2006)\nMusaic (2006)\n13 (2006)\nScorpittarius (2006)\nLa La Land (2006)\nMotherboard Connection (2007)\nFloatation Device (2007)\nBlacklight District (2008)\nColorformed (2009)\nMellow Majestic (2010) \nDisco Balls (2011) \nMorningstar (2013) \n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n'05-'09 (2009)\nGiuce Clothing Presents: Not From Concentrate Redux Mixtape (2010)\nSiesta Electronica Vol. 9 (Catharsis Records 2013)\nLa Catharsis - Quatorzieme Edition (Catharsis Records 2013)\nThe Winter Chill Essentials (Audio Lotion Recordings 2013)\nPrivate Lounge Club 5 (Catharsis Records 2013)\nLa Catharsis - Treizieme Edition (Catharsis Records 2013)\nBalearic Beach Club (Audio Lotion Recordings 2013)\nHonolulu Surf Splash - Finest Chill Beach Music (Solphet Music 2014)\nGood Night Lounge - Music for Hotels, Bars and Spas (Solphet Music 2014)\nIbiza Seasons - Spring Edition Vol. 2 - Best of Balearic Chilled Out Grooves (Karmaloft Music 2014)\nLounge Groove Vol. 1 (Catharsis Records 2014)\nSiesta Electronica Vol. 13 (Catharsis Records 2014)\nCafe Del Ibiza Vol. 1 - Best of Electronic Downbeats (Karmaloft Music 2014)\nLa Catharsis - Dix-Neuvieme Edition (Catharsis Records 2014)\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nBefore The World Was Digital with Lumis (2010)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

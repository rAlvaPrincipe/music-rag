    "text": "Math the Band is an American chiptune-based synthpunk band from Providence, Rhode Island formed in 2002 by Kevin Steinhauser. Originally being a solo project by Steinhauser, the band's style has been sometimes called Nintendocore. The band has performed over 1000 shows throughout the United States, Mexico, Canada, and the United Kingdom, touring with bands, artists and rappers such as Andrew W.K., Japanther, Wheatus, MC Frontalot, Horse the Band MC Chris, Peelander-Z, Anamanaguchi and MC Lars.

The origin of the name Math the Band originates from Steinhauser thinking of band names and having a pin on his backpack that simply said \"Math\" on it and he wanted a pin for his band so he named the band after the pin. During this time starting in 2002, Steinhauser released the studio albums: Robots Will Rise, Eep! An EP!, One Man Band For Single-Celled Organisms, The Lost Levels, Math the Band and the Secret of Mystery Island, Imaginary Everything, Greatest Hits and All Good Things, All in Good Time all under the Math the Band name and did live shows with a laptop and sometimes a box of costumes.\n\n\n=== Transition to duo (2007–2017) ===\n\nSteinhauser met Justine Mainville after playing a few shows with her then-band The Reaganauts while they were both in college.  They later became friends and dated, leading Steinhauser to ask her to join on drums and synthesizer in 2007. The duo lineup of Math the Band released the studio albums: Math the Band Banned the Math, Don't Worry, Get Real, No Thing,  Stupid and Weird and Math the Band the Band the Album.\n\n\n=== Transition to band and Flange Factory Five (2018–present) ===\nMainville later left the band and Max Holbrook, Adam Waz and Matt Zappa joined the band.

The second release was an energy drink advertised as \"A New Sport Utility Beverage\" The fourth release was a guitar pedal, Steinhauser describes it as \"a replica of the pedal that’s a playback device of the album, and you can make the sound go all weird.\" and was originally planned for a release in November but was released in early December along with an accompanying demo. The fifth was planned for a release in December and be a video game for the Game Boy Color, it is unknown when it will release but is currently in development, its released date was delayed due to their making sure the game was up to \"gamer standards\".\nOn March 16, 2021, Math the Band announced an online concert at AS220 for March 25, it was their first show since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Steinhauser also mentioned the delay of the Game Boy Color game saying \"it originally was going to be a five-minute-long thing that just got to a point in the book, and it was like do this thing and then I was like I wanna make it a longer thing and it's just not done yet.\" Him and Waz also joked that after the album delease and it's finished, it could be \"preleased\".\nOn January 7, 2023, Math the Band performed at Super MAGFest 2023.\n\n\n== Musical style and influences ==\nMath the Band has described their music as \"glitched-out, chaotic, celebration pop for the constantly anxious.\" Stylistically, the band is characterized as Nintendocore, punk rock, chiptune, indie rock, synthpunk, dance-punk, electronic, synth-pop, pop and pop punk\nMath the Band uses vintage analog synthesizers, drum machines, hacked second and third generation video game consoles and homemade synthesizers to make loud and fast, punk rock music.

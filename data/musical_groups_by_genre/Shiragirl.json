    "text": "Shiragirl is an American punk rock band from Southern California. The band currently consists of Shira Yevin, Raine Palladino, Constance Antoinette Day, and Alex Nicole Windsor. Shiragirl is best known for founding the Shiragirl Stage on the Vans Warped Tour showcasing underground, female-fronted bands.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2003, Shira Yevin played the Girlz Garage Tour to spin off Vans Warped Tour appearing under the stage name Shiragirl. \nIn 2004, Shiragirl recorded their first song \"Go, Go, Go\" with the producer Tim Armstrong of Rancid. The song ended being released on Shiragirls EP Not Sold in Stores  that was finished with the producer Johny London. \nThe same year in Fullerton, California, Shiragirl crashed Vans Warped Tour and created the makeshift Shiragirl Stage. Shiragirl, DJ Lava, and former bandmates, bought bubblegum pink color paint along with electric saws that transformed a $12,000 box truck into a mobile venue that would crank down into a 15-foot elevated wooden stage. Shiragirl was then invited by the Kevin Lyman, Vans Warped Tour founder, to finish the rest of Warped Tour as one of the acts on the festival lineup. Shiragirl was also responsible in recruiting female acts to perform at the festival. While on tour, on the last day Shiragirl performed \"Bad Reputation\" with Joan Jett.\nIn 2010, Shiragirl released the sing Scream! Spit! Sing! where they collaborated with Lil Wayne.\n\n\n== Shiragirl Stage ==\nThe band is known for efforts supporting female artists in the male-dominated music industry by founding the Shiragirl Stage at Vans Warped Tour. The \"pink-and-black\" stage allowed at least 300 female-fronted underground bands to perform at the festival. Some of the many acts included Joan Jett, Katy Perry, The Dollyrots, Blameshift, Paramore, and more.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\n\nShira Yevin – lead vocals (2003–present)\nConstance Antoinette Day – guitar, backing vocals (present)\nAlex Nicole Windsor – bass, backing vocals (present)\nRaine Palladino – drums, production (2005–present)\nFormer members\n\nLeanne Bowes – bass (2018)\nMoa Munoz - guitar (2018)\n\n\n== Recognition ==\n\n\n=== MTV 2005 \"Warpie Award\" ===\nShiragirl earned the MTV's 2005 \"Warpie Award\" for crashing the tour and following the tour in their RV without paying a fee to play as the other bands.

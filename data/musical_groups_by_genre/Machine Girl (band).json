    "text": "Machine Girl (sometimes stylized as machin3gir1) is an American electronic music project created in 2012 by Matt Stephenson (also known as DJ Chaotic Ugly) in Long Island, New York. In 2015, the project became a duo, with Stephenson recruiting percussionist Sean Kelly to play live drums.\n\nIn 2022, Machine Girl composed the original soundtrack for the video game Neon White, coming in two parts—\"The Wicked Heart\" and \"The Burn That Cures\"—in link with the scenario of the game.\n\n\n== Style and themes ==\nIn an interview with Revolver magazine, Stephenson defined Machine Girl as \"fucked-up electronic punk\" and stated that they did not like the \"industrial\" tag for being \"very goth, and very black and white\" considering the project \"a lot more colorful\". Kerrang! listed them as one of the \"bands expanding the definition of hardcore\", and described the project as \"a particularly punky and ferocious breed of the electronic sub-genre breakcore that could easily pass for hardcore when they rip it live\". Pitchfork defined their style as \"relentlessly smashing together bits of punk, grindcore, rave, industrial, and more\" and \"unpredictable and dangerous, full of animalistic rage and uncontrollable energy\".\nTheir music often features lyrics and samples criticising capitalism and exploring mental health, gender identity, and sexuality. This can particularly be seen in their albums ...Because I'm Young Arrogant and Hate Everything You Stand For, The Ugly Art and U-Void Synthesizer.\nThe project is named after the 2008 Japanese film The Machine Girl, which they occasionally sampled on their 2014 album WLFGRL.\n\n\n== Other projects ==\nStephenson is also a member of the electronic duo Prolaps with Bonnie Baxter from Kill Alters. Originally collaborating together on the track \"Vomit\" from ...Because I'm Young Arrogant and Hate Everything You Stand For, they began releasing music in 2020.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMatt Stephenson – production, vocals (2012–present)\nSean Kelly – drums (2015–present)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nWLFGRL (2014)\nGemini (2015)\n...Because I'm Young Arrogant and Hate Everything You Stand For (2017)\nThe Ugly Art (2018)\nU-Void Synthesizer (2020)\nMG Ultra  (2024)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nElectronic Gimp Music EP (2013)\n13th Hour EP (2013)\nGRLPWR EP (2013)\nMACHINE GIRL VS MACHINE GIRL (2016)\nRePorpoised Phantasies (2020)\nSUPER FREQ EP (2024)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nJet Set Radio Remixes 1 (2014)\nWLFGRL Remixes A (2014)\nWLFGRL Remixes B (2014)\nPhantom Tracks (2015)\nPhantasy Trax™ (2016)\nWLFGRL+ (2017)\nMG DEMO DISC (2020)\nStretch Collection (2020)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Gravity Diva\" (2012)\n\"Emerald Juke / Krystle (Glitch Mix)\" (2014)\n\"Killing of the Bird / Lifeforce\" (2015)\n\"Costume / Fuqthatlil\" (2016)\n\"Minnesota / Explode\" (2016)\n\"Yesterday (Machine Girl Remix)\" (2023)\n\"Concerning Peace (Machine Girl Remix)\" (2023)\n\"Until I Die\" (2024)\n\"Motherfather\" (2024)\n\"Psychic Attack\" (2024)\n\n\n=== Splits and collaborative releases ===\nDarren Keen + Machine Girl (2014)\nMachine Girl / Five Star Hotel (2016)\nShade / Machine Girl - QUARANTINETAPES_vol3 (2020)\n\n\n=== Mix compilations ===\nMRK90 Mix Vol. 1 (2017)\n\n\n=== Soundtracks ===\nNeon White Soundtrack Part 1 \"The Wicked Heart\" (2022)\nNeon White Soundtrack Part 2 \"The Burn That Cures\" (2022)\n\n\n== Music videos ==\nMachine Girl released an official music video for their single, \"Until I Die\", from the album, MG Ultra.

Finally, on October 4th 2024, they released a music video for the song \"Psychic Attack\", which is the last song of the album MG Ultra.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMachine Girl at Bandcamp\nMachine Girl at Facebook\nMachine Girl discography at MusicBrainz\nMachine Girl discography at Discogs"

    "text": "Tri Yann (Breton pronunciation: [ˈtriː ˈjãnː]) is a French band from Nantes who play folk rock music drawing on traditional Breton folk ballads.\nThe band was founded in 1969 by Jean Chocun, Jean-Paul Corbineau and Jean-Louis Jossic – all of whom remained members – hence the suggested name of Tri Yann an Naoned (Breton for \"Three Johns of Nantes\"), Jean and Yann being respectively the French and Breton versions of the name John.  They presented their final concerts in September 2021, a celebration of their 50th anniversary as a group, which was delayed by the worldwide corona virus pandemic. In December 2022, co-founder Jean-Paul Corbineau died following a long struggle with leukemia.\nAs the best known \"Celtic\" band in France, Tri Yann are one of the longest-standing Breton music groups surviving from the folk rock revival of the 1970s (following the revival of the bagadoù and Alan Stivell's work). The group are famous for the outlandish costumes worn on stage.\nAmong their best-known songs are La Jument de Michao (including the chorus \"J'entends le loup, le renard et la belette\" i.e. \"I hear the wolf, the fox and the weasel\") and Dans les prisons de Nantes (\"In the prisons of Nantes\"). Live performances usually include the Breton national anthem Bro Gozh ma Zadoù (\"The Land of My Fathers\") which has the same tune to the Welsh National Anthem.\nTri Yann sang the role of Uther Pendragon in Alan Simon's rock opera Excalibur, as well as Louis XII of France in Simon's rock opera Anne de Bretagne.\n\n\n== Members ==\nFounding members\nJean-Louis Jossic (vocals, bombarde)\nJean Chocun (vocals, mandolin, guitars)\nJean-Paul Corbineau (vocals, acoustic guitar)\nOther present members\nGérard Goron (vocals, drums) 1977–\nJean-Luc Chevalier (electric guitar, bass guitar) 1988–\nKonan Mevel (bagpipes, flutes) 1999–\nFred Bourgeois (vocals, keyboards) 1999–\nChristophe Peloil (vocals, violin) 1999–\nFormer members\nBernard Baudriller (bass guitar) 1971–1985\nJérôme Gasmi (drums) 1976–1977\nChristophe Le Helley (flute, medieval instruments, keyboards) 1992–1998\nChristian Vignoles (guitars) 1979–1988\nBruno Sabathé (keyboards) 1985–1992\nLouis-Marie Séveno (violin, bass guitar) 1986–1999\nMylène Coue (vocals) 1978\nBleunwenn Mevel (vocals) 2000–2001\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTri Yann official web site (in French)\nTri Yann discography at Discogs\nTri Yann at IMDb"

    "text": "Toy-Box is a Danish bubblegum pop band, best known for their hit singles \"Tarzan & Jane\", \"Best Friend\" \"E.T\" , \"Superstar\" ,  and \"The Sailor Song\". The group's members are vocalists Amir El-Falaki and Anila Mirza. \n\n\n== History ==\nToy-Box was founded by Amir El-Falaki and Anila Mirza in 1996, after they had met each other at a New Year's Eve party. They had been both singing and dancing professionally for some years, and also stand behind the choreographies of the group. Before becoming a part of the group, El-Falaki used to be a dance teacher.\nThe group's debut single, \"Tarzan & Jane\", was championed by Smash Hits magazine in the United Kingdom in 1999, but their UK label Edel decided to hold back the release until later on in the year, to coincide with the release of Disney's Tarzan. They elected to release \"Best Friend\" first; although it received a lot of rotation on the television channel The Box, it only reached number 41 in the UK Singles Chart, and plans to release \"Tarzan & Jane\" were cancelled. It reached number 2 in the Dutch hit lists and number 15 on the Eurochart Hot 100. In 1999, the single peaked at number 16 on MTV Europe.\nThe group's debut album, FanTastic, includes the hits \"The Sailor Song\", \"Best Friend\", \"Tarzan & Jane\", \"Teddybear\" and \"Super-Duper-Man\". It was released in September 1999 and followed in 2001 by a second album, ToyRide, which includes fan-favorite songs \"www.girl\", \"Wizard of Oz\" and \"Prince of Arabia\".\nAfter the group broke up, El-Falaki worked as a dance teacher, music video choreographer and trainer to F.C. Copenhagen's cheerleading team. Mirza later released a solo album as Aneela, featuring collaboration with Arash, including the singles \"Jaande\", \"Chori Chori\", and \"Bombay Dreams\". When asked about another Toy-Box release in 2007, Aneela said, \"I don't know, anything's possible.\"\nAs of 2017, Toy-Box has returned to tour alongside Aqua, Vengaboys, and many more groups for a series of 1990s concerts. They performed at the Vi Elsker 90'erne events in Denmark in 2017.\nIn 2024 Toy Box performed at the TMF Awards performing \"Tarzan and Jane\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Promotional singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nAqua (band)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nToy-Box Archived 2014-11-08 at the Wayback Machine\nToy-Box biography, news and discography at Bubblegum Dancer"

He received his first violin lessons from his father and then from Ferdinand Küchler.\nAfter attending the humanistic grammar school and completing his military service in Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, he studied for two years at the Universität der Künste Berlin with Andreas Moser and Henri Marteau, among others, whom he later represented, as well as at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, with Gustav Hollaender. At the age of 23 he was concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic for one year. In 1913 he won a scholarship from the Mendelssohn Scholarship.

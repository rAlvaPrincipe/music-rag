    "text": "Promyshlennaya Arkhitektura (Russian: Промышленная архитектура, Russian for Industrial Architecture) was a Soviet punk band from Novosibirsk that existed from 1988 to 1989. It was founded by Dmitry Selivanov and was disbanded shortly following his death.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was founded in 1988 by Dmitry Selivanov a few weeks after his departure from Grazhdanskaya Oborona.\nIn 1988, the band recorded the album \"Love and Technology\" (\"Любовь и технология\") at the Electron Student Club of NETI. That same year, the album was discovered by the organizers of the Syrok Moscow Rock Festival, who then invited the band to perform at the event. However, the show was disrupted because the sound was turned off.\nAfter their failure in Moscow, the band returned to Novosibirsk and recorded their concert in the Palace of Culture of Railway Workers. This became the basis for their album “Live Arhitekture,” which was almost a complete re-recording of their previous album.\nThe group disbanded after the suicide of Dmitry Selivanov in April 1989.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nRussian mathematician Misha Verbitsky:\n\nIndustrial Architecture, with a deadly cold electronic sound, drum machines, songs about the impending inevitable Holocaust, war and predestination – is experiencing a situation AFTER the collapse of human will and consciousness. Even the most optimistic listener of Industrial Architecture will not find here joy or satisfaction – only cold, melancholy and hopelessness.\n\n\n== Albums ==\nLove and Technology (1988)\nLive Arhitekture (1988)\n\n\n== Music videos ==\nThe Children of the Hospitals\n\n\n== See also ==\nZakrytoye Predpriyatiye\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDmitry Selivanov.

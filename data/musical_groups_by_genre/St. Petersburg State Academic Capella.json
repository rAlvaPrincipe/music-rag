    "text": "The St. Petersburg State Academic Capella (Russian: Государственная академическая капелла Санкт-Петербурга) (also: Glinka State Academic Capella), is the oldest active Russian professional musical institution with a history dating back to 1479. It is based in the city of Saint Petersburg. It has had various names over the years, including \"St. Peterburg Court Chapel\" (Russian: Императорская Придворная певческая капелла) and the \"Glinka State Choir of St. Petersburg\".\nThe institution currently consists of a choir, an orchestra, and has its own concert hall. It also had an educational music college at one point, which is currently independent of the Court Capella.\nIn 2000, the Saint Petersburg State Academic Capella was awarded the Liliane Bettencourt Choral Singing Prize in partnership with the Académie des beaux-arts. This award honours the Capella's quality musical output in keeping with Russia's choral tradition.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCarolyn C. Dunlop.

    "text": "JO1 (Japanese: ジェイオーワン, Hepburn: Jeiōwan) is a Japanese boy band formed through the first season of Produce 101 Japan by Lapone Entertainment, a joint venture between Yoshimoto Kogyo and CJ ENM. The group is composed of eleven members: Issei Mamehara, Ren Kawashiri, Takumi Kawanishi, Shosei Ohira, Shion Tsurubo, Ruki Shiroiwa, Keigo Sato, Syoya Kimata, Junki Kono, Sukai Kinjo, and Sho Yonashiro. The group is the first permanent Produce 101 winning group. \nJO1 debuted on March 4, 2020, and was named one of the Best 5 New Artists at the Japan Gold Disc Award. Since then, they have achieved nine consecutive Oricon number-one singles as well as eight number-one songs and two consecutive number-one albums on the Billboard Japan Hot charts. They are two-time Excellent Work Award winner at the Japan Record Award, with other accolades include three MAMA Awards and three MTV Video Music Awards Japan.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe name \"JO1\" was picked by Lapone Entertainment from recommendations made by the public (dubbed \"national producers\") via the official website of Produce 101 Japan. According to the initial suggestion, the letter \"J\" in the name refers to Japan, the group's origin nation, while the \"O1\" refers to the first year of the Reiwa, when the group was formed. However, \"JO1\" officially means that \"the trainees who have dreamed together at Produce 101 Japan will become one and aim for the top of the world\". The name was revealed in the final episode of the show.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2019: Formation through Produce 101 Japan ===\n\nJO1 was formed through the reality competition show Produce 101 Japan, which was aired primarily on the streaming service Gyao! from September 25 to December 11, 2019. A total of 6,000 participants auditioned for the show, ranging in age from 16 to 30 and not affiliated with any talent agency. The final 11 trainees were picked by viewers from the 101 through online voting and announced during a live television broadcast on TBS. Unlike previous Produce 101 franchise-winning groups, there was no intention of restricting the group's activity after its debut.\nMost of the Produce 101 Japan trainees had no experience in the entertainment industry, resulting in JO1 members having varying levels of experience. Ren Kawashiri and Shosei Ohira have previously worked as backup dancers for SMAP, Tomohisa Yamashita, Wanna One, Pentagon, and Exile among others. The latter, Keigo Sato, Syoya Kimata, and Issei Mamehara went to a local dance school; Kimata was also active as a cover dancer and Mamehara was a kid's dance teacher. Ruki Shiroiwa is a former member of Johnny's Jr., the trainee group of Johnny & Associates, and Tsukicro, a voice actor music group, while Shion Tsurubo spent ten months as a trainee at FNC Entertainment. Kawanishi, Kinjo, Kono, and Yonashiro had never received any dance or vocal training.\n\n\n=== 2020: Debut and The Star ===\nJO1 headed to South Korea shortly after the conclusion of Produce 101 Japan to produce their debut single, Protostar, where they went through an \"intense\" one-month boot camp to strengthen their skills and chemistry as a group. The single was released on March 4, 2020, and debuted at number one on the Oricon Singles Chart with over 300,000 copies sold in the first week, making JO1 the seventh artist to accomplish so with a debut single, while its lead track, \"Infinity\", reached the top of the Billboard Japan Hot 100. On March 24, JO1 made their first live television appearance on NTV's morning show Sukkiri. \nOn August 26, JO1 released their second single, Stargazer, with Hui from the South Korean boy band Pentagon co-producing the lead track \"Oh-Eh-Oh\".

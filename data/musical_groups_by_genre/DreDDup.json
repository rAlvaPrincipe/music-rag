    "text": "dreDDup is a Serbian industrial rock and electronic band.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe band was formed in 1997 in Novi Sad by guitarist/vocalist Mihajlo Obrenov and drummer/vocalist Robert Sabadoš. Soon after, they recorded their first official release Abnormal Waltz from 1998, the soundtrack for the movie Noir that was never finished. Without much musical experience, dreDDup members started experimenting with live instruments combining them with loud electronic synthesizers. At first, they made rave, techno, electronic punk and experimental music while performing live only at their rehearsal space for friends and other musicians. Their '90s era includes Beyond the Dark Portal demo cassette, 'Abnormal Waltz' DIY release and several cassette EPs. Their first songs were aired on radio shows 'Situacija 021' hosted by Vladimir Petraš and 'High Voltage' hosted by Dunja Kovač at 'Radio 021' in Novi Sad. Their song 'Roots of Us' remained at the first place on 'Situacija 021' music chart for several weeks. dreDDup started performing live at the end of the '90s in small venues in Novi Sad.\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nIn the year 2000, after one live concert at Borisov Atelje underground club, Robert left the band and Mihajlo became the new vocalist for the band. The band continued with a new line-up, changing from electronic experimental to more rock-oriented sound. Drummer Siniša Radovančev from Lost Propelleros joined the band for a while. The new stable line-up included Aleksandar Krajovan from Lowspin on bass and Nikola Prošić on drums. Following this, the band wrote music for movies and theater plays (including Poslednja Krapova Traka, Footfalls, U malom dvorcu, Hronika Sterijinog pozorja) and recorded ambient tracks for TV shows at the Radio Television of Serbia. In 2001. the band entered studio 'Do Re Mi' with the band Mefisto to record a split demo CD, followed by two separated DIY releases of both bands: Bili smo ponosni ratnici album of Mefisto and R U Digital!? demo album of dreDDup. In 2002. Karolina Nemet joined the band as a keyboard player, followed by MC Sanya on backing vocals. Nikola Prošić left the band in 2003 and was replaced by session drummer Dragan Mršić from the band Cutwork.\nIn 2004 the band finally released its first official studio album Mr Borndeads Feast for MoocSound records from the Netherlands. The album release was followed by a massive tour around Serbia. Line-up included two new members, Darko Ižak on guitar and Srđan Stevanović on drums. The band started performing frequently at various venues in Novi Sad, Subotica, Kula, Zrenjanin, Beograd, Senta and other Serbian towns.  After Mr Borndeads Feast and positive reviews from the press, the band started working on their second album, changing the sound again and making it more crossover oriented. In a collaboration with the bands Roir, Maltreat and Under Pressure the band released 'One Way' in 2005, a CD compilation which included several tracks from all 4 bands and a comic book drawn by Mihajlo Obrenov. Aleksandar Krajovan left the band in late 2006, and was replaced by Nemanja Batalo on bass guitar.\nIn 2007. the band released their second album Future Porn Machinefor Insurrection Records from Belgrade.

Another tour took place and the band visited more than 40 cities. Srđan Stevanović was arrested on the charge of murder and possession of heavy drugs, so the mid-2008 marked a complete change of the band's line-up.  The new line-up included Bojan Radaković on guitar and Ivan Francuski on drums, leaving Mihajlo the only original member in the band. The band remixed some of Nine Inch Nails songs and did a collaboration album Pituitary Nightmare with Japanese spoken word artist Kenji Siratori and also collaboration album 'The Great Industrial Comeback' with electronic music project Figurative Theatre.\ndreDDup played at numerous music festivals from 2006 to 2009, including the EXIT Festival, String, Refuse Resist, Samhain festival, Go Fest, HGF, SGT, Determination and D:S.

At the beginning of 2023, they entered the studio and started working on their eleventh album 'PanDora'.\"\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe music of dreDDup is a mixture of dark noisy electronic sounds with rough industrial rhythms and metallic vocals. They are mostly influenced by the post-industrial music scene of the late 1980s and the mid-1990s. They have changed their sound since 1997 but were always somewhere between the electro-industrial/post-industrial boundaries. After experimenting with weird noises and rough drum beats they have been striving to create a unique musical world in which rock, big beat, industrial, punk and loud electronics are equally present and blend in closely with a disturbed visual world. They call it ‘massacre industrial’ or ‘demonic electronic’. As their influences they list Bile, The Prodigy, Kim Wilde and Skinny Puppy.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Cassette releases ==\nThe Hot Stuff (1997 demo tape)\nDigital Punk Years (When We Were Teens) (1998, ep)\nTotal Noise (1998 demo tape, reissued in 2013)\nRoots of Us - Rave Years (1999, ep)\nZog Tag (1999 EP, DIY)\nTransfusion 219 (2001 EP, DIY)\nProblematic Memories (2001 EP DIY)\nR U Digitall !?

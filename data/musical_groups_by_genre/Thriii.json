The group was also known as 3mcclaingirls in 2005–2009, McClain Sisters in 2010–2014 and just McClain in 2014–2015. \nAll three sisters starred in the film Daddy's Little Girls (2007), for which they released the single \"Daddy's Girl\".

In June 2020 the group returned with a new name, Thriii, and released their single \"My Sanity\".\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSierra Aylina McClain was born on March 16, 1994, Lauryn McClain was born on January 9, 1997, and China Anne McClain was born on August 25, 1998. All three sisters were born and raised in Decatur, Georgia. The sisters grew up watching Disney films and musical classics, and they come from an artistic and musical family. Their father, Michael McClain, is a music producer who produced Solange Knowles' debut album Solo Star (2002). Their mother, Shontell McClain, is a songwriter and former screenwriter. The sisters also have a little brother, Gabriel McClain, who was born on April 17, 2001.\nIn 2004, the sisters became interested in music when they watched their father write and produce songs. The girls began to write songs, choreograph, and dance. In addition to acting, singing, and dancing, all three sisters can play the guitar, bass, and piano.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2005–2010: 3mcclaingirls ===\nIn 2005, the sisters' father had a friend over who was a music executive. The music executive heard the sisters sing and encouraged director Rob Hardy to audition China for his 2005 feature film The Gospel. China was cast as the character Alexis and her sisters were in the supporting cast. The sisters then became serious about a musical career and formed the girl group called the 3mcclaingirls.\nThey recorded their first song, \"Silly Games\". The song was produced by their father, Michael McClain, and written by their mother, Shontell McClain. In 2006 China joined the main cast of Tyler Perry's House of Payne as Jazmine Payne and Sierra made guest appearances. In 2007 the group starred in the film Daddy's Little Girls as the James sisters.

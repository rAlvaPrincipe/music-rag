    "text": "OOIOO is a Japanese experimental rock band. The four-piece ensemble was founded by Yoshimi P-We (also known as Yoshimio), the drummer and occasional trumpeter for Boredoms. The band's origin lies in a photo shoot that Yoshimi was asked to do for a magazine. She invited a few of her friends to join her, and they created a fake band for the shoot, which they later decided to make real. The band quickly gained attention by being the opening act for Sonic Youth in 1997 on their Japan tour.\nAccording to AllMusic's Kieran McCarthy \"It's next to impossible to describe their sound, because — by design — it rarely follows consistent patterns\". Some of their music has been described as having \"a majestic ebb and flow that suggests natural wonders\" or a \"witchy, tribal side\". Either way, at any one time it may incorporate chanting and punchy drums, dancey polyrhythms atonal composition or psychedelia.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nOOIOO (1997)\nFeather Float (1999)\nGold and Green (2000)\nKila Kila Kila (2003)\nTaiga (2006)\nArmonico Hewa (2009)\nGamel (2013)\nNijimusi (2019)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nOOEYヨOO -EYヨ REMIX (Eye Remix EP) (2007)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nShock City Shockers 2 (2001)\ncompilation of remixes including mixes by Yamantaka Eye, Kan Takagi, Nobukazu Takemura, and Kiyoshi Izumi; also includes \"Open Your Eyes, You Can Fly\", a cover of the Chick Corea/Flora Purim jazz fusion song\nCOCOCOOOIOO: The Best of Shock City 1997–2001 (2004)\nhighlights from their first three albums, with a remixed track from the Shock City Shockers 2 compilation\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nYOSHIMIO — vocals, guitar\nKayaN — guitars, vocals, keyboards\nAyA — bass\nMISHINA — drums\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nAi — drums\nKyoko — vocals, guitar (died July 19, 2015)\nMaki — bass, keyboards\nYoshico — drums (Her real name is Yuka Yoshimura.

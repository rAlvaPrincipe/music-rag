    "text": "George Dallas Sherman (August 23, 1844 â€“ November 3, 1927) was an American bandleader. \nSherman was born in Richmond, Vermont, United States, the son of Hathaway and Relief Sherman. At the age of 14, he joined the Richmond Cornet Band and soon became its leader. He left this band in 1864 to join the 9th Vermont Infantry as a musician during the American Civil War. After the war he came to live in Winooski, where he married Mary A. Thompson and became a band teacher.\nIn 1878 he organized, with much coaxing from the citizens of Burlington, Sherman's Military Band, made up of musicians from the dormant Queen City Band. This band came to be well known all over the East as one of the finest touring Military Bands.\n\nAfter Sherman retired from the band in 1917, the group became known as the Burlington Military Band under the exceptional directorship of Dr. Joseph Lechnyr, an influential Vermont musician. George Sherman continued to live on Sherman Street (which many erroneously believe to be named after him) until November 3, 1927, the date of the great flood. On that day, while crossing the street near his home at the corner of Sherman and Battery Street (on the park side of Battery St.) at the age of 83, he was struck by a car and died two hours later of multiple lacerations and a fractured skull. His funeral was attended by Grand Army of the Republic comrades, and the Masonic Ritual was held at his graveside. He left three children at the time of his death.\nAlthough Sherman is well remembered as one of the first leaders of what is known today as the Burlington Concert Band, he is also remembered for his fine marches, some of which were used by John Philip Sousa in his concert tours. A website has only three of Sherman's pieces, as many were lost in a fire in the same year as his death.\n\n\n== Marches ==\nListed in the Daily Free Press, January 26 1888\n\nSalute To Burlington\nFree Press March\nStannard Post March\nPublished by Jean Missud of Salem, Massachusetts\nListed in the Daily Free Press, March 28, 1891\n\nRock Point Cadets\nThe Watchman\nThe Independent\nPublished by Oliver Ditson & Co.\nListed in the Daily Free Press, March 31, 1892\n\nGeneral William Wells\nGeneral William Greenleaf\nVermont University\nCecilian March dedicated to the Ladies Quartette of St. Johnsbury\nThe Belle of America (listed as \"American Belle\" HEBM V.II) Seitz 1893\nSherman Military Band\nListed in the Heritage Encyclopedia of Band Music Vol II, October 1991\n\nAmerican Union (Coleman, 1894)\nThe Body Guard (John Church Co, 1903)\nthe Brownie's Reception (Church, 1895)\nBurlington Commandery K.T.

    "text": "Set Fire to Flames was a Canadian instrumental music ensemble consisting of 13 musicians from Montreal, Quebec. The band was often considered a side project of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, as the two groups shared several members.\n\n\n== History ==\nSet Fire to Flames was initiated by David Bryant. The group released two albums on Alien8 Recordings and FatCat Records, on their own imprint, 130701, which was set up in 2001. The first album, Sings Reign Rebuilder. was released in October that year.  \nThe ensemble's second album, Telegraphs in Negative/Mouths Trapped in Static, followed in 2003. It was recorded in a barn in rural Ontario; the sounds of the creaking doors and other background noises are heard behind the songs.\nBoth albums contain brooding, eerie music. Many of the tracks are minimalist, filled with ambient noise and various other non-musical sound effects, juxtaposed or combined with instrumental music. Both album cover images display the work of photographer Michael Ackerman. \nA third album was recorded in collaboration with the band Jackie-O Motherfucker but never released. In 2009, a composition from the band's first album was included on a compilation album released by 130701. In 2016, a previously unreleased track was issued on 130701's 15th-anniversary compilation Eleven Into Fifteen.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSings Reign Rebuilder (2001)\nTelegraphs in Negative/Mouths Trapped in Static (2003)\nFloored Memoryâ€¦.Fading Location (2009) includes \"Steal Compass/Drive North/Disappear\"\nEleven into Fifteen: a 130701 Compilation (2016) includes \"Barn Levitate\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Set Fire to Flames website\nset fire to flames bandcamp site"

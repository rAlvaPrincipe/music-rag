    "text": "Roger Clyne and The Peacemakers is an American rock band from Tempe, Arizona.\n\n\n== History ==\nRoger Clyne and The Peacemakers formed in 1998, following the removal of Brian Blush and departure of Art Edwards from The Refreshments. Frontman Roger Clyne and drummer Paul \"P.H.\" Naffah were originally joined by former Gin Blossoms member Scott Johnson, who left to rejoin his former band in 2002. James Swafford and Daryl Icard also appeared in the new lineup, but were unable to stay. Steve Larson, former guitarist for Dead Hot Workshop, also joined the band. In January 2009, it was announced that Larson would be departing and would be replaced by Railbenders frontman Jim Dalton on lead guitar.\nIn early 2004, shortly after the release of ¡Americano!, bassist Danny White left the band to start his own recording studio in Nashville, Tennessee. He was replaced by Nick Scropos, who had been the bassist for another Tempe band, Gloritone. Scropos recorded the bass track \"Green and Dumb\", on the band's debut CD, Honky Tonk Union.\nIn 2007, the Arizona Diamondbacks reached out to Roger Clyne and The Peacemakers to write a song for the team. The result, the \"D-Backs Swing,\" is played in the stadium after every home game win, and the lyrics are used in advertisements.\nThe band debuted their own brand of tequila in 2011. It was named \"Mexican Moonshine\", after the band's own song of the same name, but was rebranded in 2021 to \"Canción Tequila\" to avoid the negative connotations of the word \"moonshine.\"\nRoger Clyne and The Peacemakers frequently tour the United States and host their own seaside music festival in Puerto Peñasco. In June 2019, they celebrated the 20th year of their official Circus Mexicus festival.\nOn  July 2, 2019 Roger Clyne and The Peacemakers was inducted into the Arizona Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame. The event was held at the Tempe Center for the Arts.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHonky Tonk Union (1999)\nReal to Reel (2000)\nSonoran Hope and Madness (2002)\n¡Americano!

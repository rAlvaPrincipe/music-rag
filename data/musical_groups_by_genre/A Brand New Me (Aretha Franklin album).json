    "text": "A Brand New Me is a compilation album by American recording artist Aretha Franklin. It was released on November 10, 2017, by Rhino Records and Atlantic Records. The album features archival vocal performances that Franklin recorded for Atlantic Records accompanied by new orchestral arrangements by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and newly recorded backing vocals, in addition to the original (archived) background vocal and instrumental accompaniments.  Producer Nick Patrick said of the album: \"There is a reason that Aretha Franklin is called the 'Queen of Soul.' There is nothing more exciting than that incredible voice taking you on an emotional roller coaster ride through her amazing repertoire of songs. To have the opportunity to work with that voice on this project has been the greatest honor and to hear a symphony orchestra wrapped around those performances is breathtaking.\" Franklin died in August 2018, nine months after the album's release.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll Tracks produced by Nick Patrick and Don Reedman, with background vocal production assisted by Greg Field.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from Allmusic and the albumâ€™s liner notes\n\nPerformances with an Asterisk (*) indicates sampled archive performances.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References =="

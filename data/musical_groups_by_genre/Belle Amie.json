    "text": "Belle Amie were an English pop girl group based in London. They were formed during the seventh series of The X Factor in 2010, where they finished eleventh. The band originally consisted of Esther Campbell, Sophia Wardman, Rebecca Creighton and Geneva Lane who all auditioned to the show as soloists. Their debut single, \"Girls Up\", was released in August 2011. Lane had left the group in early January 2011 and Creighton left in April 2012 in order to pursue a solo career. The group split up in 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2010: Formation and The X Factor ===\n\nBelle Amie consisted of singers Esther Campbell, Sophia Wardman Rebecca Creighton and Geneva Lane. The group was formed after all members applied as soloists for the seventh series of The X Factor in 2010, but each failed to qualify for the Girls category. The judges, after a suggestion by Cowell, put them together in a band, qualifying for the Groups category. Their qualifying song, as well as their first song ever as a group, was an acoustic version of \"Faith\". They reached the live shows and were mentored by Simon Cowell.\nIn the first week of live shows, they sang \"Airplanes\" by B.o.B and were safe. In week 2, they sang \"You Really Got Me\". As a result of the public vote, they were put in bottom three and had to sing in the final showdown on 17 October, after Storm Lee polled the fewest votes and was eliminated. They sang \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" and were saved by judges Louis Walsh, Dannii Minogue and Cheryl Cole voted to save them and eliminate Diva Fever instead, without having their mentor Cowell to vote. However, the voting statistics revealed that Diva Fever received more votes than Belle Amie which meant that if the result went to deadlock, Diva Fever would've been saved.\nIn the third week, they sang \"I'll Stand by You\", in which they progressed to the fourth week, where they performed \"Venus\". However, they were in the bottom two for the second time with Katie Waissel, and sang \"Breakaway\" in the final showdown. The result went to deadlock, and Belle Amie were eliminated. A week later, the group performed at G-A-Y, along with series 5 finalist Diana Vickers.\n\n\n=== 2011–12: Lane's departure, debut album and Creighton's departure ===\nIn January 2011, it was reported Geneva Lane had left the group. Lane stated her short time with the band \"was absolutely brilliant, but as time went on I realised that it wasn't what I wanted and I missed performing with a live band and songwriting.\"\nTwo months after Lane's departure, they released a snippet of their debut single \"Girls Up\" in March 2011. The band signed a record deal with Dodient Records and their debut single \"Girls Up\" was released on digital download and CD single on 28 August 2011.

On 30 September 2011, they released a snippet of a new song titled, \"Shine\".\nOn 2 October 2011, Esther and Rebecca revealed that the group plan to release their debut album sometime next year, after they release several new singles.

    "text": "The Sunnysiders were an American pop music trio, who enjoyed brief success in the mid-1950s.\nThe group scored a hit with the song \"Hey! Mr. Banjo\", which reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1955. The single's popularity prompted their label, Kapp Records, to issue a full-length album under the band's name; however, the group had only recorded three songs at the time, and so the 1955 LP Hey! Mr. Banjo is actually made up of tracks recorded by a group called The Happy Harts.\nAmong the group's members were banjoists Freddy Morgan (1910â€“1970), Jad Paul, and singer Margie Rayburn, who later scored a top ten hit of her own in the US. Roy McGinnis was also a member of the group, and died on November 2, 2008.\nMorgan and Paul were members of Spike Jones and his City Slickers. Morgan, a rubber-faced comedian who had a featured role with the band in the film Fireman, Save My Child (1954), was also the co-composer of \"Hey! Mr. Banjo\" with Norman Malkin, another former group member.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBanjo Hall of Fame Members\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nYoung, Jordan R. (2005).

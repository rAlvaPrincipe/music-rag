    "text": "Across 7 Street (also spelled Across 7th Street) was an American jazz group co-led by Ari Roland and Chris Byars. The group played Sunday nights at Smalls Jazz Club for nine years until the original club's closure in 2003, and also played at the University of the Streets.  The band was formed after the death of saxophonist C. Sharpe. Its name was in reference to the University of the Streets, where Sharpe taught, being on the other side of East 7th Street from the Peter Jarema Funeral Home, where he was buried. It played music based in traditional bebop. The band was featured in the Impulse! Records compilation Jazz Underground: Live at Smalls, and recorded the album Made In New York. On September 28, 2004, tracks recorded by the band in 2001 were released under the title The Eternal Triangle for digital download, in a bid to raise money for drummer Jimmy Lovelace's cancer treatment.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAs recorded on Jazz Underground: Live at Smalls, sometime between July 3 and July 6, 1997\n\nAs recorded on The Eternal Triangle, 2001\n\nAs recorded on Made in New York, May 16, 2002\n\n\n== Made in New York ==\n\nMade in New York is the only album by the American jazz group Across 7 Street.

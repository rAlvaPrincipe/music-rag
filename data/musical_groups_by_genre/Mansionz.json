    "text": "Mansionz (stylized in lowercase) is an American alternative hip hop duo composed of musicians Mike Posner and blackbear. They released their self-titled debut album on March 24, 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\nMansionz was formed by longtime collaborators Matthew Musto and Mike Posner in late 2016. The two had previously worked together on writing songs such as Big Time Rush's 2011 single \"Windows Down\" and Justin Bieber's 2012 single \"Boyfriend\". On December 9, 2016, Musto and Posner released their debut single under the recording outfit Mansionz: \"Stfu\", featuring rapper Spark Master Tape.\nTo promote the release of their collaborative album, Mansionz released two YouTube videos, \"intro to mansionz part 1\" and \"intro to mansionz part 2,\" on January 16, 2017, and January 25, 2017, respectively. Both videos were shot by Spark Master Tape. In addition, Mansionz released two additional singles: \"Rich White Girls\" and \"Dennis Rodman,\" which were released on February 3, 2017 and March 17, 2017, respectively. Musto and Posner promoted the album on the red carpet of the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, where they both sported lime-green hair, a signature look and major aspect of their album's promotion.\nMansionz, the self-titled debut album from the duo, was released on March 24, 2017, and featured appearances from Soren Bryce, G-Eazy, CyHi The Prynce, and Snoozegod, as well as Spark Master Tape and Dennis Rodman. It received generally positive reviews from critics, although some reviewers who had enjoyed the earlier solo work of Musto and Posner were disappointed.\nOn March 29, 2017, Mansionz released an official music video for their single \"Rich White Girls\", starring Amanda Crew and Meredith Hagner as the title characters. It was followed by a music video for \"Dennis Rodman,\" which arrived on May 19, 2017.

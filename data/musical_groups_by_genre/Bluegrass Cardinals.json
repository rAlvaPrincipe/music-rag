    "text": "The Bluegrass Cardinals were a Bluegrass band from Los Angeles, California. The group is credited with being the first bluegrass band to record bluegrass gospel in a cappella. Founded in 1974, the Bluegrass Cardinals disbanded in 1997 when founding member Don Parmley announced his retirement from music.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bluegrass Cardinals were formed by Don Parmley in 1974. Parmley was a member of The Hillmen prior to forming the group, playing alongside members Vern Gosdin and Chris Hillman. Parmley was working as a musician for the television show The Beverly Hillbillies and is credited with all banjo work on the show with the exception of the intro theme song. Hillman had moved on from The Hillmen, finding success with the group The Byrds. The original group was formed with Parmley, Randy Graham, and Parmley's 15 year old son David Parmley.\nThe group released its first album in 1976, shortly after moving from southern California to Virginia. The self-titled album was released on Copper Creek Records label. They released their second album, Welcome to Virginia, on Rounder Records in 1977. The group went through numerous lineup changes and through the years included members Dennis Fetchet, Bill Bryson, and Larry Stephenson.\nThe Bluegrass Cardinals released numerous more albums throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, all of which were on the CMH Records label. It also made numerous appearances on the Grand Ole Opry. They recorded three additional albums in the 1980s under the Sugar Hill Records label. The group stopped performing for a short time in 1991 after Don and David left to record an album with Del McCoury. David would never return to the Bluegrass Cardinals, pursuing a solo career as a musician instead, co-founding the group Continental Divide in 1992.\nThe Bluegrass Cardinals eventually disbanded in 1997 when Don Parmley left the group. CMH released a collection of the group's music in 2002. Entitled The Essential Bluegrass Cardinals, the album was put together by David Parmley. Following the release, the group performed several reunion shows at various locations in the United States.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBluegrass Cardinals biography on AllMusic"

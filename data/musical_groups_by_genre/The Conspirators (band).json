    "text": "The Conspirators were a  British northern indie / folk band. \nThe band consisted of five members (as of 2008).\nIn 2008, the band signed a management deal with Jon Shellers Brilliant Management, and released the double A-side single featuring Judy Dyble, former Fairport Convention vocalist. (Who was also managed by Sheller). The single included a remake of Fairport Convention's song \"One Sure Thing\" and The Conspirators song \"Take Me To Your Leader\". It reached No.7 in the official uk indie singles chart, spending 3 weeks in the top 10.\nThe promotion for this single saw Dyble make a couple of very rare live appearances, at the Harrogate International Conference Centre, and at an in-store live gig at HMV's superstore in Leeds city centre on 3 March 2008.\nIn 2012 Conspirators released their debut album \"What's Going On\".\nThe album featured guest performances from Dodgy lead guitarist Andy Miller, as well as Echobelly's Glenn Johansson. In 2017, most of the 2008 named members reformed under the new name The Doubtful Bottle.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJohn Gillies - rhythm guitar/vocals\nGenevieve Parker - vocals\nLaura Goodacre - Drums\nMike Cinnamond - Bass\nJim Beadle - drums\nNathan Reeve - bass\nJim Gillies - keys\nDarren Banner - lead guitar\nLee Potter - lead guitar (The Doubtful Bottle)\nMarco Ramsay - Bass (The Doubtful Bottle)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nLaura Goodacre - Drums"

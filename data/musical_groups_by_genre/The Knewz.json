    "text": "The Knewz is a polka band based in Buffalo, New York, which was started in 1990 by Mike Burka, Tom Picciano, and Tommy Wanderlich.  The band plays many original songs, covers of country and rock songs, and also traditional Polish polkas, obereks, and waltzes.\nIn 2008, The Knewz received two awards from the United States Polka Association: Favorite Recording of the Year, Headlinez, and Favorite Song of the Year, \"When I Call Your Name\", written by Tommy Wanderlich. Occasionally, fans of the band would bring cue cards with the words to songs on them as Wanderlich would often forget the lyrics. This is believed to have been started by Wisconsin native, Debbie Dunaj.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\n\n\n== Touring ==\nThroughout their existence The Knewz has toured most of the northeast and midwestern states.

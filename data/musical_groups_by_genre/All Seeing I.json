Their regular live vocalist was Bozz, who later went on to form electronica duo Hiem.\nAll Seeing I were asked in November 1998 to produce a cover of \"Beat Goes On\" for Britney Spears' debut album ...Baby One More Time. They have also remixed a variety of artists, including Pulp.\nDean Honer also fronts the similarly styled group, I Monster.\nBuckle went on to be a part-time member of Fat Truckers and formed Relaxed Muscle with Jarvis Cocker.

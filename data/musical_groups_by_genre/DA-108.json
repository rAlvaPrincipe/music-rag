    "text": "DA-108 is a rap group from Saint Petersburg, Russia, and was formed in 1994 by Pavel Pachkay (DJ-108) and Roman \"Cooper\" Alexeev. A distinctive feature of the group is strong emphasis for flow with frivolous attitude to the content of lyrics (the term was even coined wack style — the style of nonsense).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nPavel Pachk'ay aka «DJ 108» was born in 1973 in Leningrad in the Soviet Union. In his children and youth he was engaged in breakdancing. In January 1990 Pavel went to study in the US for a month on an exchange program. During this he found and became interested in rap and hip-hop. In 1991 he went to the Institute he met Anton aka Fux was a famous breakdancer in Saint Petersburg. Then they decided to create a rap group. Fux was a lyric, Pavel made a music. Name DA-108  was appeared into the title after reading the article \"Solving a strange number». They didn't have any musical equipment and all of their first records was made in a home studio on a tape recorder using the Soviet drum machine \"LEL\", using samples from southern hip-hop. The recorded demo album consists of 10 tracks.\nIn 1992 they purchased a Yamaha drum machine and a Lomo microphone and they began to record their second album. After some performances, Fux left the group in 1993. In summer 1993 DJ 108 met Rasim from the Academy-2 group. Thanks to Rasim Pavel starred in the video «Буду погибать молодым» (Budu pogibat molodym/To die young) of Mister Maloy MC.\nIn 1994 DJ 108 met Roman Alexeev aka Cooper from «S.M.D.» group on the basketball court. Cooper became the third member of DA-108. DJ-108 offered Cooper to make verse on the track «Московский гуляка» (Moscovsky gulyaka/Moscow reveller) of Sergey Esenin under music of famous hit of Malchishnik group. March 8, 1994 was the first performance of this song. \nThe group toured around St. Petersburg and Moscow, participating in various festivals and promotions with some songs. Author of all lyrics was DJ-108 except track «Я хочу сказать» (I want to say) by Cooper. Lyrics of DA-108 strongly influenced by the absurdist poetry of Daniil Charms. This style was named wack style — the style of nonsense. The flow and music of DA-108 was influenced by oldschool rap groups Ultramagnetic MC's, House of Pain, Naughty By Nature, Das EFX. Signature feature of DA-108 was using quotes from Soviet films.\nIn 1994 the group was invited to the concert «Stop The Violence» by Academy-2 group, organized by Vlad Valov.

In 1994, near the Gorkovskaya metro station, Cooper began selling audio cassettes of rap. DJ Kefir created radio advertising for him. Many rappers of St. Petersburg tightened to Cooper. They formed the group «DA-108 Flava» aka Горьковская туса (Gorkovskaya Tusa). This creative association included a lot of rap collectives : «X-team», «Адреналин» (Adrenaline), «ЧП», «D-Story», «Невский Бит (Nevsky Beat)», «Зелёный Синдром» (Zeleny sindrom / Green Syndrome), «Ikambi Gwa Gwa», A-Tone and others.

Some tracks was created on poems of Sergey Esenin and Daniil Kharms.\n\nI spent a long time collecting material. The oldest tracks are : «Новый год(Novy God / New Year)», «Праздник Эйтона ( A-Tone holiday)», «Чёрная Кошка (Chernaya Koshka / Black cat)». Songs are written and accumulated slowly. These songs were written almost in 1998…The last songs were written faster — I learned to work with sound, because there is no Director's education, only courses, thanks to the Screw for the help. «Чёрная Кошка» it was written in General for a whole year. It was associated with certain events in my life, I was there for a long time the text was forced, the music. I learned to work with life sampler. I lost my voice. I should have ended my career ща MC in winter 1999. Went two months of silence. I lost my voice on this song. I was almost electrocuted. Then I put my voice on the same song for three months. It's been almost a year and I wrote it down. With each song in a different way.

    "text": "Directions in Groove or DIG were an Australian acid jazz band which formed in 1991 by Alexander Hewetson on bass guitar, Terepai Richmond on drums and percussion, Rick Robertson on saxophone, Tim Rollinson on guitar and Scott Saunders on keyboards. Originally styled as dig they performed instrumental acid jazz before Saunders added vocals. They released three studio albums, Dig Deeper (March 1994), Speakeasy (August 1995) and Curvystrasse (September 1998). At the APRA Music Awards of 1996 they won Most Performed Jazz Work for their track, \"Futures\". They disbanded in 1998 before reforming in 2008 for selected performances and again 2011 to release a fourth studio album, Clearlight (October 2011).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1991–1993: Formation and EP ===\nDirections in Groove formed in 1991 in Sydney by Alexander Hewetson on bass guitar, Terepai Richmond on drums and percussion, Rick Robertson on saxophone, Tim Rollinson on guitar and Scott Saunders (ex-Deckchairs Overboard, Beatfish, also in Bellydance) on keyboards. Hewetson, Richmond and Robertson were, \"all graduates of the New South Wales Conservatorium of Jazz.\" Styled as dig they initially performed instrumental acid jazz before Saunders added vocals. They became popular with a residency at Kinselas in Oxford St, Sydney.\nThe band toured nationally and in April 1993 released a five-track, self-titled extended play. This attracted Polygram records to sign the band. The Canberra Times' Linc Dubwise observed, \"[the] acid jazz group, however, delights in the potential of jazz as accessible, entertaining, populist and, above all, danceable. The acid label is no more than a convenient identifier for the current generation of artists melding elements of jazz, fusion, funk, rap, soul and world music.\" They continued touring in the following year, Hewetson left to join rock, funk, disco group, Swoop; he was replaced on bass guitar by Sam Dixon.\n\n\n=== 1994–1998: Dig Deeper, Speakeasy and Curvystrasse ===\nDIG released their first studio album, Dig Deeper, in March 1994. It peaked at No. 6 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and was certified gold by Australian Recording Industry Association for shipment of 35,000 units. Nicole Leedham of The Canberra Times observed, \"It attracts both older jazz audiences and younger rock followers and keeps them both happy.\" The group changed their name to Directions in Groove, to avoid confusion with a Canadian group, dig, which was touring internationally. Dig Deeper had its international release via Verve, and they undertook tours in Australia and Europe. In July 1994 they performed at Battersea Park, London for Britain's first B & S Ball. They also toured supporting other artists, Herbie Hancock and Bootsy Collins.\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 1995, they were nominated for two awards; ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist – Album and ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist – Single (for \"The Favourite\").\nDirections in Groove released their second album, Speakeasy in August 1995, which was co-produced by the group with Jeremy Allom (Incognito, Björk, Massive Attack). It reached No. 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, compared their first two albums, \"[this] was a more mature, confident and ultimately more durable album... It was a fine collection of sweet, funky jazz-grooves backed up impeccable musicianship.\" Christo of Tharunka magazine felt Dixon provides, \"a big thick meaty bass line that pumps solidly through each track. This new bass sound coupled with the beautifully inventive drumming of Terapai Richmond allows the other musicians to fly high, confident in the rock solid rhythm section. The listener is at ease and floats with the band to places silky smooth and be-bop groovy.\" A limited release version of Speakeasy included a bonus disc of six live tracks recorded at the Basement, Sydney.\nAt the APRA Music Awards of 1996 they won Most Performed Jazz Work for \"Futures\".\nA third studio album, Curvystrasse was released in September 1998, and was co-produced by the group with Lex Wilson. The album peaked at number 35 on the ARIA Chart. The group disbanded shortly after.\n\n\n=== 2008–present: Reformation and Clearlight ===\nThe original members of the group reformed in the wake of playing to a packed crowd in June 2008. During 2011 Laura Stitt joined on lead vocals, they subsequently recorded their fourth studio album, Clearlight, which was released on 14 October 2011.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAlexander Hewetson – bass guitar (1991–94, 2008)\nTerepai Richmond – drums, percussion (1991–98, 2008, 2011–13)\nRick Robertson – saxophone (1991–98, 2008, 2011–13)\nTim Rollinson – guitar (1991–98, 2008, 2011–13)\nScott Saunders – keyboards, vocals (1991–98, 2008, 2011–13)\nSam Dixon – bass guitar (1994–98)\nLaura Stitt – vocals (2011–13)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live album ===\n\n\n=== Extended play ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== APRA Awards ===\nThe APRA Awards (Australia) are annual awards to celebrate excellence in contemporary music, which honour the skills of member composers, songwriters, and publishers who have achieved outstanding success in sales and airplay performance.\n\n\n=== ARIA Music Awards ===\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music.

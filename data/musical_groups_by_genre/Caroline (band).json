    "text": "Caroline (stylised in all lowercase) is an English rock band formed in London in 2017, consisting of Casper Hughes, Jasper Llewellyn, Mike O’Malley, Oliver Hamilton, Magdalena McLean, Freddy Wordsworth, Alex McKenzie, and Hugh Aynsley.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe band was formed in 2017 by Jasper Llewellyn, Mike O’Malley and Casper Hughes. Hughes and Llewellyn began playing music together while studying at the University of Manchester, and the lineup of the band slowly expanded over the years into its current 8-piece format. Initial material came from weekly improvisation sessions, from which songs were reworked to form material for their debut self-titled album, caroline, which was released on February 25, 2022. Caroline was mostly recorded in 2020. In support for their upcoming North American tour, the band released a cover of Claire Rousay's \"Peak Chroma\" as a single on September 26, 2022.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nCaroline is described as a band that approaches various genres such as folk rock and Midwest emo based on post-rock. O'Malley also played Appalachian folk standards with Llewellyn and drummer/percussionist Hugh Aynsley as a teenager, which formed an influence on the debut.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, the band described key single \"Good Morning (Red)\" as being inspired by the rise of Jeremy Corbyn's socialist Labour Party movement in 2017, and the \"wave of optimism\" that came alongside it.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCasper Hughes – guitar, vocals\nJasper Llewellyn – cello, drums, vocals, guitar\nMike O’Malley – guitar, bass, vocals, keyboards, cello, percussion\nOliver Hamilton – violin, vocals\nMagdalena McLean – violin, vocals\nFreddy Wordsworth – trumpet, vocals\nAlex McKenzie – clarinet, saxophone, flute, vocals\nHugh Aynsley – drums, percussion\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\ncaroline (2022)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Barracudas are an English surf rock band formed in late 1978. The band's original line-up consisted of Jeremy Gluck (vocals), Robin Wills (guitar and vocals), Starkie Phillips (bass and vocals) and Adam Phillips (drums). Before the band recorded its first single, Starkie and Adam Phillips left the band.\nThe band is notable for their 1980 hit single \"Summer Fun\", which started with an excerpt from a 1960s spoof advertisement for the Plymouth Barracuda campaign. The song included dialogue where announcers had difficulty pronouncing the word barracuda. The single reached number 37 on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe band officially lasted until 1981 with a final performance in Madrid. There have been few occasional performances since.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nThe beginnings of the band can be traced back to the year of 1978 when Canadian-born Gluck met Wills at a Dead Fingers Talk concert. Here the pair bonded over a shared passion for \"60's garage and psychedelic music \". They started off calling themselves the \"R.A.F.\", but eventually settled on the name of The Barracudas. The name was inspired by a song they both liked by The Standells.\n\n\n== Recent activity ==\nInitially perceived as a novelty surf act due to their first album, subsequent recordings showed them to be a fierce garage rock and roll band in the mould of the 13th Floor Elevators and The Seeds. The band split in 1984, but reformed in 1989 to record \"Wait For Everything,\" and then again in 2003. In 2005 they recorded the self-titled album on NDN. Throughout their career, their live performances have been energetic and frenetic.\nAfter the first attempt at their second album, the group lost drummer Nick Turner to the group Lords of the New Church. Afterwards, Jeremy Gluck and guitarist Robin Wills assembled a new The Barracudas group, that went on to record their second album Mean Time.\nThe Barracudas disbanded in 1984, after making their third and final album Endeavour to Persevere. However, in 2005, there became a growing interest regarding the reissue of their back catalogue. This resulted in Gluck and Wills reconnecting, and the two of them began composing again.\nIn 2014, the band reissued their Meantime album as a limited edition picture disc, under the reborn \"Closer French\" label. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== 7\" Singles ===\n\"I Want My Woody Back\" / \"Subway Surfin\" Cells CELLOUT 1 (February 1979)\n\"Summer Fun\" / \"Chevy Baby\" Zonophone Z5 (July 1980)\n\"His Last Summer\" / \"Barracuda Waver\" / \"Surfers Are Back\" Zonophone Z8 (September 1980)\n\"(I Wish It Could Be) 1965 Again\" / \"Rendezvous\" Zonophone Z11 (November 1980)\n\"I Can't Pretend\" / \"K.G.B.

    "text": "The Frankfurter Opern- und Museumsorchester (Frankfurt Opera House and Museum's Orchestra) is the resident orchestra of the Oper Frankfurt. Its somewhat peculiar name is derived from the series of \"Museum Concerts\", organized by the Frankfurter Museumsgesellschaft since 1808. The orchestra is ranked as an \"A-list\" ensemble under the German TVK regulations. Its music director and principal conductor is Thomas Guggeis.\n\n\n== History and repertory ==\nWith a history spanning more than 200 years, the Frankfurter Opern- und Museumsorchester is one of Germany's oldest symphonic ensembles. It was founded in the late 18th century as the orchestra of the Oper Frankfurt, Frankfurt's municipal opera. In addition to playing in the opera house, the orchestra maintains a series of 10 subscription programs per season (each played twice, on Sundays 11 a.m. and Mondays 8 p.m. CET, respectively), performed at the Alte Oper Frankfurt, a former opera house converted into a concert hall.\nThe orchestra has attracted leading conductors and musicians since its founding. Composer-violinist Louis Spohr was the second principal conductor (1817–1819) of the Museumsorchester; his successors included Clemens Krauss, William Steinberg, Franz Konwitschny, Georg Solti, Christoph von Dohnányi, and Michael Gielen.\nOther notable conductors and composers who led the orchestra have included Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Arthur Nikisch, Hans Pfitzner, Willem Mengelberg, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Hans Knappertsbusch, Hermann Abendroth, Bruno Walter, and George Szell. The orchestra has played the premieres of several operas.\nRichard Strauss' large-scale tone-poems Ein Heldenleben and Also sprach Zarathustra were both premiered by the Frankfurter Opern- und Museumsorchester.\nMany leading soloists have appeared with the orchestra, beginning with Johannes Brahms and Clara Schumann in the 19th century. From 1915 to 1923, composer-violist Paul Hindemith served as concertmaster of the Opern- and Museumsorchester. Its repertoire includes major operatic and symphonic works from Baroque to contemporary music.\nIn the 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 seasons, the Museumsorchester was voted one of the three top German opera orchestras in the country, selected by the leading operatic magazines in Germany. For the 2007/2008 season, the noted German periodical Die Deutsche Bühne voted the Oper Frankfurt the best opera house in Germany. Finally, in 2009, the respected music-industry magazine Opernwelt voted the Opern- und Museumsorchester Orchestra of the Year among all the German opera- and theatre orchestras, an honour the orchestra shares with the Bayerisches Staatsorchester; in both 2010 and 2011 the orchestra was again named \"Orchestra of the Year\".\n\n\n== Music Directors and Principal Conductors ==\n\n\n== Orchestra Members (2023–2024 season) ==\nSource:\n\n1st violin\nIngo de Haas, Dimiter Ivanov, Gesine Kalbhenn-Rzepka, Artur Podlesny, Vladislav Brunner, Arseni KulakovTarasov, Sergio Katz, Hartmut Krause, Basma AbdelRahim, Kristin Reisbach, Karen von Trotha, Dorothee Plum, Christine Schwarzmayr, Freya Ritts-Kirby, Juliane Strienz, Almut Frenzel-Riehl, Jefimija Brajovic, Gisela Müller, Beatrice Kohllöffel, Stephanie Gierden, Yoriko Muto, Tsvetomir Tsankov, Cornelia Ilg, Alexandra Tsiokou\n\n2nd violin\nGuntrun Hausmann, Jörg Hammann, Aischa Gündisch, Ruth Elisabeth Müller, Olga Yuchanan, Lin Ye, Susanna Laubstein, Donata Wilken, Frank Plieninger, Nobuko Yamaguchi, Lutz ter Voert, Sara Schulz, Peter Szasz, Yu-Lin Tsai, Merve Uslu, Samuel Park, Miri Kim, Shaoling Jin\n\nviola\nThomas Rössel, Philipp Nickel, Wolf Attula, Lev Loiko, Guillaume Faraut, Jean-Marc Vogt, Mathias Bild, Fred Günther, Ulla Tremuth, Susanna Bienroth, Ariane Voigt, Elisabeth Friedrichs, Friederike Gutsch, Gabriele Piras, Maria del Mar Mendivil Colom, Vaida Rozinskaite\n\ncello\nRüdiger Clauß, Mikhail Nemtsov, Sabine Krams, Lukas Plag, Johannes Oesterlee,  Florian Fischer, Roland Horn, Nika Brnič Uhrhan, Mario Riemer, Bogdan Michael Kisch, Janis Marquard\n\ndouble-bass\nBruno Suys, Tamás Frank-Dessauer, Hedwig Matros-Büsing, Peter Josiger, Rafael Kufer, Ulrich Goltz, Matthias Kuckuk, Philipp Enger, Jean Hommel, Kalle Helm\n\nflute\nSarah Louvion, Eduardo Belmar,  Elizaveta Ivanova, Almuth Turré, Giovanni Gandolfo\n\noboe\nNanako Becker, Johannes Grosso, Márta Berger, Aurélien Laizé\n\nclarinet\nJens Bischof, Claudia Dresel, Diemut Schneider, Ramón Femenía, Matthias Höfer\n\nbassoon\nAndré Rocha, Richard Morschel, Henrike Kirsch, Eberhard Beer\n\nhorn\nMatthijs Heugen, Ku-Hsin Chen, Joseph Longstaff, Stef van Herten, Tuna Erten, Claude Tremuth, Genevieve Clifford, Sara Oliveira\n\ntrumpet\nMatthias Kowalczyk, Florian Pichler, Balázs Drrahos, Markus Bebek, Wolfgang Guggenberger, Dominik Ring\n\ntrombone\nJeroen Mentens, Miguel García Casas, Hartmut Friedrich, Manfred Keller, Rainer Hoffmann\n\ntuba\nJózsef Juhász-Aba\n\ntimpani\nTobias Kästle, Ulrich Weber\n\npercussion\nJürgen Friedel, Nicole Hartig-Dietz, Steffen Uhrhan, David Friederich\n\nharp\nFrancoise Verherve, Barbara Mayr-Winkler, Sara Esturillo Sanchez\n\norchestra assistants\nTorsten Frenzl, Anton Lauer, Ivan Scaglione, Aaron Veil, Hanns Will\n\n\n== Venues ==\n\n\n== Books ==\nBartholomäi, Paul (2002).

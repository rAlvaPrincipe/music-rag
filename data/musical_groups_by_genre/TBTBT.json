    "text": "Too Bad to Be True, or TBTBT, was a Canadian hip hop group, based in Toronto, Ontario, active in the 1990s. They were best known for their 1993 album One Track Mind, which won the Juno Award for Rap Recording of the Year at the 1994 Juno Awards. The group consisted of teenagers Jeromy \"Lyric J\" Robinson, Shaka \"DJ Shaka\" Dodd, Al \"Al C\" Cox, and Frankie \"MC Styles\" Scarcelli.\n\n\n== History ==\nTBTBT began writing and recording raps in 1992 when they were still in school. They took part in Toronto's annual Stay Clear anti-drug campaign pop contest. In 1993 the trio released the album One Track Mind on ISBA Records in Canada and Cold Chillinâ€™/Warner Bros. Records internationally.\nThe group received significant video airplay on MuchMusic for the album's title track, but consistent with the commercial struggles faced by Canadian hip hop at the time, received almost no commercial radio airplay in Canada outside of the Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal markets.\nIn 1994 the group released a second single, \"Get Down to It\", from their album. The track appeared on the RPM Canadian Content chart for six weeks in April and May that year.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nBoth of TBTBT member Jeromy Robison's sons have pursued a career in rap under the stage names of Casper TNG and K Money.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Album ===\nOne Track Mind (1993)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"One Track Mind\"\n\"Get Down To It\"\n\n\n== References =="

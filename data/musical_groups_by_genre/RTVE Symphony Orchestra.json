The Orchestra is based at the Teatro Monumental in Madrid, Spain.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe orchestra was established in February 1965, with the purpose of serving both the national Radio and Television networks of Spain, as well as the Festivales de España.  Its first concert occurred on 27 May 1965, conducted by Igor Markevich, at the Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid.  The orchestra's first concert in Barcelona took place on 8 June 1965.  At the beginning of the orchestra's history, Antoni Ros-Marbà and Enrique García Asensio served as co-principal conductors of the orchestra, from 1965 to 1967.  Ros-Marbà stood down from his post in 1967.  In 1968, Odón Alonso subsequently became co-principal conductor alongside Enrique García Asensio.  Both conductors remained in the posts until 1984.\nThe orchestra's current principal conductor is Christoph König, as of the 2023-2024 season.  In March 2024, the orchestra announced the appointment of Thomas Dausgaard as its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2024-2025 season.\n\n\n== Principal conductors ==\nAntoni Ros-Marbà (1965–1967)\nEnrique García Asensio (1965–1984)\nOdón Alonso (1968–1984)\nMiguel Ángel Gómez Martínez (1984–1987)\nArpad Joó (1988–1990)\nSergiu Comissiona (1990–1998)\nEnrique García Asensio (1998–2001)\nAdrian Leaper (2001–2010)\nCarlos Kalmar (2011–2016)\nMiguel Ángel Gómez Martínez (2016–2019)\nPablo González (2019–2023)\nChristoph König (2023–present)\n\n\n== Principal guest conductors (partial list) ==\nMiguel Ángel Gómez Martínez\nAntoni Ros-Marbà (1988–1991)\nDavid Shallon (1997–1999)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunity of Madrid Orchestra\nMadrid Symphony Orchestra\nMiguel Borrego, co-concertmaster\nSpanish National Orchestra\nQueen Sofía Chamber Orchestra\nTeatro Real\nNational Auditorium of Music\nTeatro Monumental\nZarzuela\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Spanish-language homepage of the Orquesta Sinfónica y Coro RTVE"

    "text": "F.S.K. (Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle, German meaning \"voluntary self control\") is a German band that formed in Munich in 1980. The band has been associated with avant-garde fringes of Neue Deutsche Welle (German New Wave) of the early 1980s and with techno and house music since the mid 1990s.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in Munich in 1980 by Wilfred Petzi, Thomas Meinecke, Justin Hoffman and Michaela Melian, contributors to the underground magazine Mode & Verzweiflung (Fashion & despair). The band name is a reference to the German motion picture rating organisation Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft, which uses the same acronym. From 1985 the band was championed by British disc jockey John Peel, recording six sessions for his BBC radio show, and were themselves strongly influenced by the independent British music scene of the time, such as by the unusual interpretation of country music by the Mekons. FSK records were released on Zickzack, a record label owned by German music journalist and punk rock advocate Alfred Hilsberg. F.S.K. frequently played with David Lowery of Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker and recorded in his studio in Richmond, Virginia. In the mid-1990s the band recorded Techno and House music, recording in Uphon Studios in Weilheim, Bavaria. On their album First Take Then Shake they worked with Detroit producer Anthony Shake Shakir.\nThe band members are active in the arts, Thomas Meinecke as a successful novelist, Michaela Melián as a professor at the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg, Justin Hoffmann as director of the Wolfsburg Art Society and Wilfried Petzi as a photographer.\n\n\n== Lineup ==\nWilfred Petzi - trombone, guitar, vocals, percussion\nThomas Meinecke - concertina, guitar, vocals, percussion\nJustin Hoffmann - electric piano, guitar, xylophone, vocals\nMichaela Melian - bass, melodica, vocals\nCarl Oesterheld - drums, percussion (joined in 1990)\nDavid Lowery and Johnny Hickman (vocals, guitars) of the American band Cracker frequently collaborated with F.S.K. from 1990-1995 and were occasionally listed as full members.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nas Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle:\n\nFreiwillige Selbstkontrolle [Herz aus Stein], 1980, ZickZack ZZ 6 (7-inch EP)\nTeilnehmende Beobachtung, 1981, ZickZack ZZ 27 (7-inch EP)\nStürmer, 1981, ZickZack ZZ 80 (12-inch LP)\nMagic Moments, 1983, ZickZack ZZ 155 (12-inch EP)\nÇa c’est le Blues, 1984, ZickZack ZZ 2001 (12-inch LP)\nGoes Underground, 1985, ZickZack ZZ 1789 (12-inch LP)\nLast Orders (The John Peel Session), 1985, ZickZack ZZ 1066 (12-inch EP)\nContinental Breakfast, 1987, ZickZack ZZ 2532 / Ediesta CALC LP 16 (12-inch LP) [Sampler 1983–1985]\nAmerican Sector, 1987, Ediesta CALC 32 (12-inch EP)\nIn Dixieland, 1987, ZickZack ZZ 1987 / Ediesta CALC LP 042 (12-inch LP / CD) [CD contains Magic Moments EP]\nas F.S.K.:\n\nDouble Peel Sessions, 1989, Strange Fruit Records SFPMA204 (12-inch LP / CD)\nOriginal Gasman Band, 1989, ZickZack ZZ 8000 (12-inch LP / CD) [CD contains American Sector EP]\nBudweiser Polka / Cannonball Yodel, 1990, Sub Up Records (7-inch single)\nSon Of Kraut, 1991, Sub Up Records SUBLP 12 (12-inch LP / CD) [in some discographies erroneously referred to as Richmond (VA) where it was recorded]\nThe Sound Of Music, 1993, Sub Up Records subup25 (12-inch LP / CD)\nThe German-American Octet, 1994, Return To Sender (Normal Records) RTS 8 (CD)\nBei Alfred, 1995, ZickZack ZZ 1995 (2×CD) [Sampler 1980 - 1989]\nInternational, 1996, Sub Up Records subup28 (2×12″ LP / CD)\n4 Instrumentals, 1997, Disko B 64 (12-inch EP)\nTel Aviv, 1998, Sub Up Records subup31 (12-inch LP / CD)\nDid You See Davidopoulos Hit That Ball (F.S.K.) / Landla (HP Falkner & Cpt.

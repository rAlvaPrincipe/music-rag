    "text": "The Chainsmokers are an American electronic DJ and production duo consisting of Alex Pall and Drew Taggart. They started out by releasing remixes of songs by indie artists. The EDM-pop duo achieved a breakthrough with their 2014 song \"#Selfie\", which became a top-twenty single in several countries. They have won a Grammy Award, two American Music Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards and nine iHeartRadio Music Awards. According to Forbes' 2019 list of highest-paid celebrities, the Chainsmokers were the highest-paid DJs, dethroning Calvin Harris after six years.\nTheir debut EP, Bouquet, was released in October 2015 and featured the single \"Roses\", which reached the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100. \"Don't Let Me Down\", featuring American singer Daya, became their first top-five single on the Billboard chart and won the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording at the 59th awards ceremony. Their single \"Closer\", featuring American singer-songwriter Halsey, became their first number-one single on the Billboard chart. The duo's second EP, Collage, was released in November 2016. Their debut studio album, Memories...Do Not Open, was released in April 2017 and topped the US Billboard 200 chart. Their second album, Sick Boy, was released in December 2018. Their third studio album, World War Joy, was released in December 2019 and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Dance/Electronic Albums Chart. So Far So Good, their fourth studio album, was released on May 13, 2022. Their fifth studio album, Summertime Friends, followed on October 20, 2023. In 2024, the duo released their third EP, No Hard Feelings.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2012: Formation ===\nThe Chainsmokers were initially made up of Pall and former DJ Rhett Bixler. The Chainsmokers were re-formed as an EDM DJ duo in 2012 under the management of Adam Alpert in New York City. Pall attended New York University for art history and music business while Taggart had been attending Syracuse University and was an intern at Interscope Records before the two met. Taggart had taken an interest in being a DJ and released some original songs on the website SoundCloud. Taggart was informed by someone working for Alpert that a duo, which was being managed by Alpert, had an open spot after Bixler left, which prompted Taggart to leave Maine in order to go to New York City. Pall, who had grown up as a DJ and had been working at an art gallery in Chelsea, Manhattan at the time, was introduced to Taggart by Alpert. In April 2013, the Chainsmokers released a remix of \"Medicine\" by Daughter and it reached number 1 on HypeMachine.\nThe duo started out by making remixes of indie bands. In 2012, they collaborated with Indian actress and recording artist Priyanka Chopra on the single \"Erase\" which was followed by \"The Rookie\" in early 2013.\nDuring an October 2016 television interview, ABC News Nightline reporter Nick Watt asked Pall and Taggart \"What's with the (duo's) name?\" Pall replied that, \"At the time of conception, it was... it was totally just like I was in college. You know I enjoyed smoking weed and you know it was just like such a 'yeah the domain's open'. I don't have to have any, like, underscores.\" Taggart added \"It's just a name.\"  In an interview during the Upfront Summit 2023, Alex Pall stated that the name \"Chainsmokers\" was a provisional based on the fact that he used to smoke a lot of cigarettes and they needed only one name for promotional flyers.\n\n\n=== 2013–2014: First live performance and breakthrough ===\n\nThe duo's first live performance was opening for Timeflies at Terminal 5 in September 2014. Their single \"#Selfie\", released for free in December 2013, was picked up by Dim Mak Records who re-released it in January 2014 and eventually streamed it to Republic Records. The duo achieved breakthrough success as the single charted internationally and peaked on the Dance/Electronic Songs chart. Pall has described the song as \"life-changing\" for the pair.\nOn August 5, 2014, the Chainsmokers released \"Kanye\", featuring sirenXX, the follow-up to \"#Selfie\".

The Chainsmokers began teasing their eventual return after completing their fourth studio album, occasionally breaking their social media fast to post promotional material for the upcoming album and reiterate that they were continuously working on the project.\n\n\n==== Safe & Sound charity concert ====\nOn July 14, 2020, after having largely isolated themselves since the social media hiatus and the COVID-19 pandemic, the duo announced plans to hold a \"drive-in\" charity concert, \"Safe & Sound\", on July 25, as their first in-person concert since January 2020 prior to Super Bowl LIV. The concert was presented by Jerry Media's Tequila brand JAJA, which is co-owned by the Chainsmokers. The concert was stated to be a \"socially-distanced drive-in show to benefit the charities No Kid Hungry, Southampton Fresh Air Home, and the Children's Medical Fund of New York\" and was meant to be a future example of COVID-19 pandemic concert audience safety. On July 25, 2020, the Chainsmokers and Goldman Sachs' CEO, David Solomon, who produces EDM under the stage name DJ D-Sol, headlined the charity concert in Southampton, New York. The event was stated to follow guidelines issued by the CDC in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including attendees being required to take temperature checks for 14 days prior to the event and when entering, being provided with complementary face masks, and instructed to remain within the vicinity of their parked vehicle unless using a restroom. At the time of the concert, the state of New York prohibited non-essential gatherings of more than 50 people. However, footage from the event on social media seemingly showed a large crowd of attendees in a mosh pit, which would have been in violation of social distancing recommendations. The concert received backlash from social media users who pointed out that images and videos posted by the concert-goers did not promote social distancing as the concert promoters had initially stated. The event was investigated by the state of New York health authorities for \"rampant\" violations of social distancing guidelines.\nOn July 27, 2020, Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo criticized the \"egregious\" violations of social distancing requirements present at the event, and announced that the New York State Department of Health would conduct an investigation. Its commissioner Howard Zucker questioned how the town of Southampton believed the event \"was legal and not an obvious public health threat\". A representative of the venue told BuzzFeed News that the mosh pit did contain a mixture of steel and retractable barriers to divide it, and that security was present to enforce the boundaries and mask requirements.\nIn October 2020, the state fined the event organizers, In the Know Experiences, $20,000 for holding a non-essential event and failing to enforce health guidelines such as wearing masks.\n\n\n==== Words on Bathroom Walls ====\nDuring their hiatus, the group also scored the soundtrack for the film Words on Bathroom Walls. The film was released on August 21, 2020, and features soundtrack music scored by the group, alongside previous releases \"Push My Luck\", \"Somebody\", alongside an additional song, \"If Walls Could Talk\".\n\n\n=== 2022: So Far So Good ===\n\nOn January 5, 2022, the duo released their first new music in two years on their SoundCloud page – a remix of Bon Iver's cover of \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" by Bonnie Raitt alongside a remix of The Anxiety's 2020 single \"Meet Me at Our Spot\".\nOn January 24, 2022, the Chainsmokers announced the lead single \"High\" from their fourth studio album. The song was released on January 28, 2022. The second single \"iPad\" was released March 11, 2022.\nOn April 6, 2022, the duo announced that their fourth studio album, So Far So Good, would be released on May 13, 2022.\nA third pre-release single from the album, \"Riptide\", was released on April 22, 2022.\nOn May 17, 2022, the Chainsmokers distributed 5,000 NFTs that give rights to streaming royalties from So Far So Good to fans. On July 22, the duo released the deluxe edition of the album, which included the singles \"The Fall\" with DJ duo Ship Wrek, \"Why Can't You Wait\" with electronic duo Bob Moses, and \"Time Bomb\".\n\n\n=== 2023: Summertime Friends ===\nOn April 21, 2023, the Chainsmokers released the song \"Up & Down\", followed by \"Self Destruction Mode\" and \"See You Again\" featuring ILLENIUM in June, \"Celular\" and \"My Bad\" in July and lastly, \"Summertime Friends\" and \"Jungle\" in September. They released their fifth studio album titled Summertime Friends on October 20, 2023. The cover art for the EP was inspired by Wong Kar-Wai's 1995 film Fallen Angels. In 2023, the Chainsmokers collaborated with Japanese rock star Yoshiki to perform a classical version of \"Closer\" in the documentary film Yoshiki: Under the Sky. \n\n\n=== 2024: No Hard Feelings ===\nOn March 29, 2024, the Chainsmokers released the song \"Addicted\", a collaboration with Brazilian producer Zerb, and featuring Ink, followed by \"Friday\", a collaboration with Fridayy on April 26, 2024, \"Bad Advice\", a collaboration with Welsh-Canadian ELIO, \"Tennis Court\", \"Green Light\" in May 10, 2024, \"No Shade At Pitti\" on May 15, 2024. They released an EP titled No Hard Feelings on May 10, 2024.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nTaggart has described the duo's music as \"blurring the lines between indie, pop music, dance music, and hip-hop.\" The pair have cited Pharrell Williams, Linkin Park and deadmau5 as musical influences. Acts who have inspired the Chainsmokers' songs include Blink-182, Taking Back Sunday, Taylor Swift, Max Martin, The xx, Beach House, and Explosions in the Sky.\nDespite their commercial success, the duo has faced criticism and ridicule from some quarters for their \"Silicon Valley bro\" vibe. Billboard has referred to them as \"two of the most ridiculed artists in mainstream music,\" while The New York Times has described them as \"easily loathed\", Pitchfork, in an early review, mocked the duo for their \"full-throated support to the tech bro lifestyle\" and their use of Silicon Valley buzzwords such as \"iterating\", \"disrupting\", and \"return on investment\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nAlexander \"Alex\" Pall was born on  (1985-05-16) May 16, 1985. He shares the role of producer and DJ alongside Andrew Taggart, performing programming, mixing and mastering songs. He also co-writes and plays the piano on some songs.

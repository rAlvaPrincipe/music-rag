    "text": "Crazy P (formerly known as Crazy Penis) is an English electronic music group, formed around 1995 by Chris Todd and Jim Baron.\n\n\n== History ==\nTodd and Baron formed the band after meeting at the University of Nottingham. The band's sound incorporates soul music, disco and house music. By 2002 the band expanded to include bassist Tim Davies, percussionist Mav Kendricks, and vocalist Danielle Moore. Todd explained the origin of the band name: \"A flat mate of mine had a record called 'loco pinga' which roughly translates to Crazy Penis, we were going to call ourselves loco pinga but once we told people that, they liked crazy penis better for the shock value.\"\nThey were signed by Manchester label Paper Recordings and have since released six albums and several singles, starting with \"Digging Deeper\" in 1996. They built up a strong fanbase in Australia where they have toured several times.\nTheir track \"There's a Better Place\" samples the song \"Pure Imagination\" from the movie Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.\nTheir track \"Stop Space Return\" was released as iTunes UK's single of the week on 28 October 2008.\nThe band began using 'Crazy P' exclusively in 2008 with Moore explaining \"We wanted to grow, and keep growing, so there was no point in cutting our nose off to spite our face by keeping the original name.\"\nThe band's last album, Age of the Ego, was recorded in 2019. For the album, Moore wrote political themed lyrics which railed against the worship of high-profile politicians and celebrities, and also advocated for grassroots, community work, investment in the public sector and taxing billionaires and “people who have ravaged this country”.\nMoore, who still served as the group's frontwoman and who also wrote lyrics for some of Crazy P's songs, died on 30 August 2024, at the age of 52.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nA Nice Hot Bath With...

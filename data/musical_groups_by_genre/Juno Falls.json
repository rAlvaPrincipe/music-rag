A year later, they released their debut album Starlight Drive. The group then signed with V2 Records and released their sophomore album Weightless in 2007. Writing for AllMusic, Stewart Mason wrote \"Unfortunately, just as Weightless was released in the U.K., Juno Falls' label, V2 Records, underwent a complete restructuring, meaning this fine, likable, and potentially commercially successful record largely disappeared upon its release.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nStarlight Drive (2004) SN8 CD/LP\nWeightless (2007) V2 Records CD/LP\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n\n\n== References =="

Robert Enforsen, Richard Jomshof and Leslie Bayne started the band in 1988 under the name Pole Position.\nRobert Enforsen joined the band as lead vocalist in 1989, and the band released their first demo, at which point they changed their name to Elegant Machinery, a name derived from the album by DATA, a British synthpop group of the 1980s led by Norwegian Georg Kajanus.\nDue to Leslie Bayne's stagefright, Johan Malmgren joined the band as a tour musician in 1992. He later became a permanent member.\nThe band was very successful in Sweden, with a number of successful singles and various awards. In the rest of Europe, their biggest break into the mainstream was with the single Process, which reached number 5 in the Spanish charts.\n\n\n== Breakup, reunion, breakup and reunion ==\nElegant Machinery disbanded in 1999.\nIn 2001, the band temporarily reunited (with Johan temporarily replaced by Jarmo Ollila of Daily Planet) for their first-ever American appearance, followed by a performance in Mexico.

They released a new EP on October 14, 2016, entitled, \"I\"\nSince 2019 Elegant Machinery has consisted of Robert Enforsen and Johan Malmgren. Leslie Bayne left the band in March 2023.

    "text": "The Fila Fresh Crew was a hip-hop group from Dallas, Texas. consisting of Fresh K, Dr. Rock and The D.O.C. (known then as Doc-T).\n\n\n== History ==\nDr. Rock's association with Dr. Dre during his stint as a DJ for the World Class Wreckin' Cru helped land the Fila Fresh Crew a spot on the N.W.A and the Posse compilation album in 1987. A year later, the trio released the EP Tuffest Man Alive which was promoted with three singles.\nDoc-T left the group and changed his name to The D.O.C., becoming a valuable contributor to Eazy-E's debut album and newly formed gangsta rap group N.W.A. Acting as a writer to many tracks with Ruthless Records (and later Death Row Records), the D.O.C. is most remembered for his 1989 debut album No One Can Do It Better featuring the hit single \"It's Funky Enough\".\nThough the Fila Fresh Crew had disbanded by 1988, Dr. Rock launched a solo album of his own in 1991 under the pseudonym Fela Fresh Crew. In 2017, Tuffest Man Alive was released on CD for the first time with a previously released b-side (\"I Wanna Know What Love Is\") included as a bonus track.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended play ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFila Fresh Crew discography on Discogs\nFila Fresh Crew on Werner Von Wallenrod's"

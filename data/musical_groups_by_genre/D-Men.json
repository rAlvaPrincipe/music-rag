    "text": "D-Men was a Dutch rap formation established in 1997 under the name D-Men Squad. This was after a freestyle session they held on a basketball court in Diemen-Zuid. The original members of D-Men were rapper Lange Frans, his brother rapper Brutus and a childhood friend rapper-singer Bart Zeilstra better known as Baas B. They picked the name that sound like their home town Diemen. Many others joined in the formation, famous for its mixtapes De Straatremixes. D-Men also have their own record label named D-Men Entertainment.\n\n\n== Members ==\nBesides the three founding members, many joined in the group that its heyday had the following members:\n\nOriginal members\nLange Frans (rapper)\nBaas B (rapper/singer)\nBrutus (rapper)\nJoining members\nNegativ (rapper)\nDJ MBA (DJ)\nYes-R (rapper)\nBrace (singer)\nSoesi B (rapper)\nC-Ronic (rapper)\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1997, the band's original trio started at various small venues.

With the joining of new members, the name was changed to D-Men Entertainment with the inclusion of Negativ, DJ MBA, Brace, Yes-R, Soesi B and C-Ronic. D-Men regularly performed in many venues including in Amsterdam and released three mixtapes: The original De Straatremixes in 2003, followed by De Straatremixes Deel 2 and De Straatremixes Deel 2 both in 2004.

A single \"Vraag jezelf eens af\" was released. Contractual disagreements intensified with rapper Yes-R who joined the label of his cousin Ali B. Soesi B, a friend from childhood to Yes-R followed suit. The last of the new members to leave was Negativ. This the formation went back to the original three members Lange Frans, Brutus and Baas B.

    "text": "The Barra MacNeils are a Canadian musical group from Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia.  The founding members of the group are siblings Sheumas, Kyle, Stewart, and Lucy MacNeil.  In 2005, two additional brothers, Ryan and Boyd, joined the band. The Scottish island of Barra is the ancestral home of Clan MacNeil.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\nThe MacNeil siblings are from Cape Breton Island and began performing together in 1980 while still teenagers (Lucy MacNeil being only 10 years old). Consequently, they were only able to perform on weekends, and toured during school holidays. The siblings are classically trained musicians and alumni of Mount Allison University. (Sheumas '84, Kyle '85, Stewart '87, and Lucy '91)\nIn 1986, they released their first eponymous album on their own independent label. The Barra MacNeils won their first East Coast Music Award in 1991, and have won four more since, including a Juno Award for Album of the Year for TimeFrame in 1992, and a Group of the Year award in 2001. They signed with PolyGram, and their first two albums were re-released while their 1993 album Closer To Paradise earned a gold record. They have been an opening act for CÃ©line Dion and have toured regularly across North America and Europe.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBarra MacNeils www.barramacneils.com\nEntry at canadianbands.com\nThe Barra MacNeils discography at Discogs\nThe Barra MacNeils at IMDb"

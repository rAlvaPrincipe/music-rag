    "text": "Kíla is an Irish folk music group. It was formed in 1987 in Irish language secondary school Coláiste Eoin in County Dublin.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early formation ===\nThe original lineup of the band was Rossa Ó Snodaigh (whistle and bones), Rónán Ó Snodaigh (bodhrán), Eoin Dillon (uilleann pipes), Colm Mac Con Iomaire (fiddle), Karl Odlum (bass) and David Odlum (guitar). In 1988, one of Rossa and Rónán's older brothers, flute player Colm Ó Snodaigh, joined the band. Rónán, Rossa and Colm are brothers of Teachta Dála, Aengus Ó Snodaigh, and sons of Pádraig Ó Snodaigh and Clíodna Cussen.\nThey began by busking in Dublin; their first booked performance was \"to three people\" at the Baggot Inn.\nIn their first year, they busked on Grafton Street nearly every week and played 44 concerts, most of them at their father's publishing company's book launches, their mother's art exhibition openings or their brother's political campaign launches. Their first paying concert was upstairs in the Baggot Inn and was attended by only three people, one of whom was the broadcaster Bláthnaid Ní Chofaigh.\n\n\n=== Tours and collaborations ===\nIn 1988, they went abroad to play at their first festival in Germany and made their first recording. Since then, Kíla have played in the Montreux Jazz Festival, Cambridge Folk Festival, Vorneo's Rainforest World Music Festival, Electric Picnic, Womadelaide and Glastonbury Festival. They performed at the Opening Ceremony of the Special Olympics in Ireland in 2003.\nIn 2006, the band collaborated with Ainu-Japanese artist OKI on the album \"Kila & Oki.\"\nIn 2008, Kíla recorded \"The Ballad of Ronnie Drew\" along with other artists as a tribute to the Dubliners singer. In 2010, the band collaborated with French composer Bruno Coulais on the soundtrack of Cartoon Saloon's Oscar-nominated movie, The Secret of Kells. In the same year, their music was featured in three films: Maeve Murphy's Beyond the Fire, Ciarán O'Connor's Trafficked, and the award-winning Peter J. McCarthy documentary, Fight or Flight. In late 2011, Kíla published Book of Tunes, a book containing over 100 of their compositions, photos, poems and prose.\nIn 2015, the band collaborated with Bruno Coulais on the music for the Oscar-nominated animated feature, Song of the Sea, and they received an Annie Award nomination for 'Outstanding Achievement in Music in an Animated Feature Production'. They also received an Emmy nomination for their work on the \"Crossing The Line\" production called, The Secret Life of the Shannon.\nIn 2020, Kíla recorded music for the 2019 film Arracht (for which they won an IFTA) and the 2020 film Wolfwalkers. Arracht was nominated for 11 IFTA awards and won two, with Kíla awarded 'Best Original Score'. During the two COVID-19 lockdowns, the band performed six online concerts in a Wolfwalker-themed Saint Patrick's Day broadcast. After the lockdowns, they went on tour and produced three shows: Kíla and Tumble Circus (September 2021), Kíla le Prás (New Year's Eve 2021) and Kíla and Cairde for TradFest in the National Stadium (January 2022).\n\n\n== Members ==\nIn 1988, flute player and singer Colm Ó Snodaigh joined; in 1991, fiddler Colm Mac Con Iomaire and guitarist Dave Odlum left Kíla to join the band The Frames; Dee Armstrong replaced Colm on fiddle and guitarist Eoin O'Brien; and lead guitarist Dave Reidy joined. In 1994, Karl Odlum left and joined Mick Christopher's band The Mary Janes; he was replaced by jazz bassist Ed Kelly, who left in 1995 along with Eoin O'Brien after the release of Mind The Gap. Drummer and rhythm guitarist Lance Hogan took Eoin's place and Laurence O'Keefe filled in on bass until Brian Hogan became bass player prior to recording Tóg É Go Bog É (1996).\nIn 2009, Donegal guitarist Seanán Brennan joined the band to replace Hogan, who was on a sabbatical. In 2010, drummer Dave Hingerty was invited to join the band. In 2015, piper Eoin Dillon left and James Mahon replaced him. Dee Armstrong began playing with Kíla in 1991. She has composed for three animated feature films with the Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nExcerpt of an article about Kíla by Donald Mahoney, 2007\nArticle by Nadine O Regan about Kíla and Oki in the Sunday Business Post, 13 August 2006"

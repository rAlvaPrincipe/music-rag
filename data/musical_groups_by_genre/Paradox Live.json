    "text": "Paradox Live is a Japanese media mix project created by Avex Pictures and GCREST. The project features 29 voice actors and is centered on rap battles between each faction.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nIn the near future, amidst the Hip-Hop culture rises a new movement called \"Phantom Live\". The rappers create illusions linked to their emotions using chemically reactive accessories that contain a metal called \"phantometal\" with their own DNA to enthuse young people on a brilliant stage. Behind the scenes, however, they suffer from \"traumatic illusions\" as a side effect.\nThe Paradox Live's story follow four groups who are immensely popular with their respective genres. BAE, The Cat's Whiskers, cozmez and Akan Yatsura (悪漢奴等). They will lead the way to the legendary club called CLUB PARADOX where the mysterious gathering occurs. In order to prove that their own music is the number 1, they participate in battles. \nAfter a disaster that caused the collapse of CLUB PARADOX and prevented the final battle between the winning group and the legendary duo Buraikan (武雷管), the club has been rebuilt with a brand new competition to take place. Four new groups–VISTY, AMPRULE, 1Nm8, and Goku Luck (獄Luck)–have joined the ring alongside the current cast.

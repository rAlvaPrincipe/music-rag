    "text": "Chew Lips was an English dance-pop trio, formed in spring of 2008. It consisted of singer 'Tigs' and multi-instrumentalists James Watkins and Will Sanderson \n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2008–2009: First steps ===\nFormed in London as a three piece band in the summer of 2008, Huerta, Watkins and Sanderson armed themselves with a slew of electro-pop hooks and set about establishing Chew Lips as one of the most exciting new acts in the capital.\nWith Tigs developing into a charismatic whirlwind of a front woman who it was impossible to take your eyes off, Chew Lips increasingly compelling live performances grabbed the attention of uber-cool French label Kitsuné who insisted on putting out the band's debut single, \"Solo\".\nReleased in March 2009, \"Solo\" sold out almost instantly, causing a storm in the blogosphere and beyond, with Pitchfork calling the track \"….classic, pristine,\" and The Fly magazine labelling it \"one of the most magnificent debuts of the year\".\n\n\n=== 2009–2010: Second Kitsuné single and Unicorn ===\n\nA relentless schedule of touring followed into 2009 as Chew Lips honed their sound into a sleek, sophisticated beast.\nKitsuné released a second sold out single, \"Salt Air\" in July 2009 – NME called it \"an addictive slice of heart-wrenching disco-pop\" – before the band begun work in summer '09 on their full-length debut with Bat For Lashes collaborator David Kosten.\nThe fruits of their labour came with the self-released album Unicorn in January 2010, such a giant leap forward for their sound that they were confident enough to leave off both of the previous singles. It was easy to see why – in the likes of \"Play Together\", \"Karen\" and \"Slick\", they had outdone themselves. The press agreed: the BBC called it \"startling\", NME \"mesmeric\", whilst a 4/5 review in The Guardian said it \"drags you straight in.\"\nAnother stretch of touring followed and by the time the European festival season came round, and after a successful appearance at SXSW in Texas (Elle US described them as the best new act at the festival), Chew Lips were on top of their game. Topping off their tour they headlined the packed BBC Introducing Stage at Glastonbury Festival.\nOther touring highlights include support slots with The Killers, Delphic, We Are Scientists, The Virgins, Joy Formidable, Howling Bells, three sold out UK tours and a sold out European tour in 2011.\n\n\n=== Split ===\nHuertas announced on Twitter in 2015 that she was now only writing material for other artists, implying that Chew Lips had disbanded.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n\n\n== Chew Lips remixing ==\nBernard Sumner, Hot Chip and Hot City – Didn't Know What Love Was\nParty Horse – Lazer Beam\nTape The Radio – Stay Inside\nAmanda Blank – Make It Take It\nPlastiscines – Barcelona\nThe Brute Chorus – Heaven\n\n\n== Chew Lips remixes ==\nSolo\n\nDavid E Sugar\nTepr (Yelle)\nSalt Air\n\nAlex Kapranos\nDekker & Johan\nJupiter\nPlastician\nTwo Door Cinema Club\nPlay Together\n\nWaWa\nKaren\n\nAnalogue People in a Digital World\nMark Otten\nNetsky\nWe Are Enfant Terrible\nSlick\n\nFC Kahuna\n\n\n== Soundtracks and syncs ==\nPretty Little Liars (US TV series)\nThe Vampire Diaries (US TV series)\nMTV (Various)\nParis Connections (UK film)\nSkins (UK TV series)\nMade in Chelsea (UK TV series)\n\n\n== Live appearances ==\n\n\n=== UK highlights ===\nGlastonbury Festival\nThe Great Escape Festival\nWakestock\nLatitude Festival\nLovebox Festival\nSecret Garden Party\nTruck Festival\nKendal Calling\nStandon Calling\nRip Curl Boardmasters Festival\nJersey Live\nBestival\n\n\n=== United States ===\nSXSW\n\n\n=== European festivals ===\nElectric Picnic\nLondon Calling Festival, the Netherlands\nLes InRocks Festival & Ground Zero Festival, France\nDockville Festival, Germany\nParedes de Coura Festival, Portugal\nGjon Sports Dome, Spain\nCupola Festival, Switzerland\nSummer Well Festival, Romania\nBažant Pohoda Festival, Slovakia\nOff Festival gości Electronic Beats, Poland\n\n\n== Press ==\n\n\n=== Unicorn ===\n\"4/5 – an accomplished first offering\" – Q\n\"4/5 – sharp-edged, sharp-witted electro rock...success looks like an open goal\" – Mojo\n\"4/5 – a spine tinglingly awesome debut\" – Time Out\n\"4.5/5 – it deserves to be massive...make it so\" – The Fly\n\"4/5 – brilliant...a record that gets better over time\" – MusicOMH\n\"4/5 – Synth heaven!\" New!\n\"Beautiful...clattering electronic pop with big melodies\" – The Independent\n\"Wistful, discoid confections... like Blondie backed by Simian Mobile Disco\" – The Observer\n\"A band to look out for this year… absolutely superb\" – Sunday Mail\n\"Our new favourite\" – NME\n\"An utterly peerless work; ten tracks to completely lose yourself in\" – NME.com\n\"Catchy electro tunes...you'll love 'em\" – Grazia\n\"Unicorn is that rarest of things; a record imbued with genuine talent and emotion which wipes the floor with the majority of its makers' contemporaries... quite startling\" – BBC\n\"Chew Lips confidently reveal their crossover potential... the rhythms are edgy and the songwriting is something you can really get your teeth into\" – Metro\n\"Chew Lips' blending of electronic punk ala 'Yeah Yeah Yeahs go 8-bit' is so infective it's dangerous\" – Super Super\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nChew Lips's channel on YouTube"

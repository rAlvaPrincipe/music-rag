    "text": "LAKE (which stands for the founding members Lindsay, Ashley, Kenny, and Eli) is an American indie pop band, signed to Off Tempo, based in Langley, Washington.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed in 2005, in Olympia, Washington, they are best known for composing the end song to the Cartoon Network show Adventure Time, entitled \"Christmas Island\" or \"The Island Song\" (written by Ashley Eriksson). A version of the song was featured on their third album, Let's Build a Roof. Another Adventure Time episode entitled \"Shh!\", featured their song \"No Wonder I\", and another episode, entitled \"The Music Hole\" featured their song \"I Look Up To You.\" Their most recent contribution was their short tune \"Greatly Appreciated\", sung in Season 8, Episode 25, \"Min and Marty.\"\nOn August 22, 2015, the band celebrated their 10-year anniversary by playing all their albums from start to finish in a 12-hour marathon set at Bayview Hall, Whidbey Island, Washington. Their tenth album, Roundelay, was released on April 25, 2020.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nLake features male and female vocals backed by guitars, keyboards and occasionally horns. AllMusic referred to Lake as being \"one of several brainy and sweet indie pop bands... to call the Pacific Northwest their home.\" These characteristics were also noted in their reviews by Pitchfork Media. Like many artists on K Records, their style is lo-fi.\n\n\n== Album overview ==\n\n\n== Studio albums ==\nFirst Album (July 19, 2006)\n\nCassette (October 1, 2006)\n\nOh, The Places We'll Go (October 10, 2008)\n\nLet's Build a Roof (October 6, 2009)\n\nGiving and Receiving (April 5, 2011)\n\nCircular Doorway (July 17, 2013)\n\nThe World is Real (September 17, 2013)\n\nForever or Never (April 7, 2017)\n\nPractice Space (February 3, 2020)\n\nRoundelay (April 24, 2020)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nLAKE's profile on Off Tempo's website\nPitchfork Media reviews"

They were founded in 2008 by Diplo and Switch, with Switch leaving after three years in 2011. He was then replaced by both Jillionaire and Walshy Fire. In June 2019, Jillionaire left the group and was replaced by Ape Drums. Their music spans numerous genres, mixing reggae with dancehall, reggaeton, soca, house and moombahton.\nMajor Lazer has released four full-length albums: Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do in 2009, Free the Universe in 2013, Peace Is the Mission in 2015, and Music Is the Weapon in 2020. They have also released six EPs, including Apocalypse Soon in March 2014, which featured vocal contributions from Pharrell Williams and Sean Paul, and Know No Better in 2017, which featured appearances from Camila Cabello, Quavo, Travis Scott, and J Balvin, among others. Major Lazer has also notably produced Reincarnated, the debut reggae album by Snoop Dogg under his \"Snoop Lion\" persona. In March 2018, Billboard ranked Major Lazer at number five on their 2018 Billboard Dance 100 ranking of dance musicians.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2009–11: Guns Don't Kill People...

Major Lazer ended a US tour summer of 2009.\nThe album's first single was \"Hold the Line\", the video for which, directed by Eric Wareheim, was nominated for a MTV Video Award in the Breakthrough Video category. It was also featured in the video game FIFA 10. The track \"Zumbie\" has a music video that features comedian Andy Milonakis. Music videos for the songs \"Pon de Floor\", \"Keep It Going Louder\", and \"Bubble Butt\" were directed by Eric Wareheim. In June 2009, Major Lazer were featured for the first time on the cover of the publication The Fader, in its 62nd issue.\nMajor Lazer performed at the Falls Music & Arts Festival (Lorne, Victoria, Australia) on December 30, 2009, and the Coachella Music Festival in April 2010.

It used the intrumental tracks from the self-titled debut album and \"brazenly mashes them up with beats and rhymes that are almost wholly up-to-the-minute hip, encompassing rap, R&B, dancehall, and dubstep\". On June 20, 2010, the group released an EP titled Lazers Never Die. It contained two new songs and three remixes, by Thom Yorke and others.

The first single, \"Lean On\", was a collaboration with French producer DJ Snake and featured vocals from Danish recording artist MØ. It was released March 2, 2015. The song was first offered to Rihanna and then Nicki Minaj, who both turned it down; however Diplo later mentioned that no one could have done a better job than MØ in the recording. The song reached number 4 on the US Billboard's Hot 100 chart and number 2 in the UK charts.

It debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 1 in several other countries including on the UK Official Charts, making it their most popular single yet. On September 30, 2016, \"Believer\", a collaboration with Dutch production duo Showtek, was released as the second single from Major Lazer's upcoming fourth album. The album's title, Music Is the Weapon, had been announced in May 2015, and was set to have \"a few more club songs, a few more festival songs\" than Peace is the Mission, but to be \"in the same spectrum.\"\nOn December 6, 2016, Major Lazer released a promotional single for Music Is the Weapon, titled \"My Number\". The song is a collaboration with Bad Royale that samples \"54-46 That's My Number\", which Pitchfork describes as \"a genre-defining classic from legendary ska/reggae group Toots and the Maytals.\" The song contains newly recorded vocals from frontman Toots Hibbert specifically designed for Major Lazer, changing the original lyrics to incorporate the group into the song while keeping the original melody.\nFollowing the success of singles \"Cold Water\" and \"Believer\", Major Lazer released their third single titled \"Run Up\" January 26, 2017. The song features Canadian musician PartyNextDoor and rapper Nicki Minaj, serving as a follow-up to the tropical, laid-back sound of \"Cold Water\".

However, in 2018, Diplo stated that the album will be released in 2019 and that it will be their last.\nOn June 1, 2017, Major Lazer released a six-song extended play titled Know No Better, with the title track featuring Camila Cabello, Travis Scott, and Quavo.

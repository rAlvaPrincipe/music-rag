    "text": "Gregor Samsa is an American band from Virginia, United States, formed in 2000 and fronted by Champ Bennett. It takes its name from the main character of Franz Kafka's novella The Metamorphosis.\nThe band's sound, although rooted in the post-rock genre, differs from that of other bands in the genre in that it employs dual vocals by Bennett and Nikki King, a feature which relates them to the shoegazing and slowcore genres. Gregor Samsa has stated on its website that \"the early history of the group has been lost in a wash of noise, strange beeps, and outright lies”.\nReviews of their album compared it to acts such as Brian Eno, Múm,  Sigur Rós, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Low.\nIn support of its latest release, the band played twenty-one eastern US venues in March before then venturing a 23-date tour of the United Kingdom, France, Luxembourg, and Germany during April. Historically, the band has chosen to tour and perform alongside a wide array bands and genres including Spokane, Kayo Dot, Barzin, Part Chimp, Calla, Engine Down, Isis, Pelican, Explosions in the Sky, Interpol, and many others.\nThe band completed their most recent album, Rest, in late 2007 and released it in April 2008.\n\n\n== Current members ==\nChamp Bennett - guitar, vocals, piano\nBilly Bennett - drums, video, samples\nNikki King - Rhodes piano, keyboard, vocals\nJeremiah Klinger - guitar, baritone guitar, clarinet, theremin\nCory Bise - bass guitar\nBobby Donne - Synth\nMike Ashley - drums\nMia Matsumiya - violin\n\n\n== Past members and contributors ==\nBrandon Evans - guitar,  keyboard, lap steel guitar\nJason LaFerrera - bass guitar\nEarl Yevak - drums\nBobby Donne - bass guitar\nRick Alverson - guitar\nJason Wood - bass guitar\nEric Yevak - guitar\nAmber Blankenship - cello, violin\nJon Sullivan - double bass\nNick Wurz - bass guitar (sometimes played with a bow)\nNathan Altice - guitar, keyboard\nTony Thaxton - drums\nToby Driver - clarinet and vibraphone\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n55:12 (CDLP 2006)\nRest (CDLP 2008)\nOver Air (CD 2009)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nGregor Samsa (CDEP 2002)\n27:36 (CDEP 2003)\n27:36+2dot (LP 2004)\n\n\n=== Splits ===\nSplit with The Silent Type (2001)\nSplit with Red Sparowes (2005)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMySpace Profile\nPress Highlights for 55:12\nLast.FM Profile\nDiscography @ Discogs.com\nKennedy Center Performance"

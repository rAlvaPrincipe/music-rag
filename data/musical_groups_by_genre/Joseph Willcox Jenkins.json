    "text": "Joseph Willcox Jenkins (15 February 1928 – 31 January 2014) was an American composer, professor of music, and musician. During his military service in the Korean War, he became the first arranger for the United States Army Chorus. He ended his teaching career as Professor Emeritus at the Mary Pappert School of Music, Duquesne University, where he had been a professor since 1961, and composed over 200 works.\n\n\n== Early life and military service ==\nBy the age of six, Jenkins had already begun piano lessons; soon afterward, he started composing small pieces in elementary school. In high school, he wrote numerous arrangements as well as some original works for orchestra. In 1946, Jenkins began his tertiary studies at Saint Joseph's University (then St. Joseph's College) in Philadelphia, where he focused on pre-law with the ambition of becoming a lawyer. At the same time, he studied composition and counterpoint with Vincent Persichetti at the Philadelphia Conservatory (which became part of the University of the Arts in 1962). Jenkins completed his degree at St. Joseph's in three years and enrolled in the Eastman School of Music in 1949. While there, he studied under important composers including Thomas Canning, Howard Barlow, Bernard Rogers, and Howard Hanson. Jenkins graduated from Eastman with a Masters of Music in 1951, in the middle of the Korean War. He was subsequently drafted into the Army and assigned to serve at Fort George G. Meade, in Maryland.\nDuring his military service, Jenkins was the arranger for The United States Army Field Band as well as for the Armed Forces Radio Network. While with the Army Field Band, he composed his now famous American Overture for Band, Op. 13. A 50th anniversary version of American Overture for Band was published by Theodore Presser Company in 2004, with collaboration between Jenkins and the publisher. The original score was updated to include revisions to the work's dynamics, articulations and pitches. American Overture became Jenkins' most successful work and he stated he would be \"hard-pressed to duplicate its success.\"\n\n\n== Teaching career and reenlistment ==\nIn 1953, Jenkins held an interim teaching position at Catholic University, replacing a professor on sabbatical. He was so impressed by the faculty and courses at Catholic that he decided to take advantage of G.I. Bill funding and complete his doctorate there, studying under William L. Graves and other scholars. While there, Jenkins also studied under Conrad Bernier, who Jenkins would later list in an autobiographical book chapter under individuals who were especially influential in his development and career.\nIn 1956, Jenkins reenlisted in the military to become chief arranger and assistant conductor of the United States Army Chorus, formed that same year, becoming the institution's first arranger. Established as the vocal counterpart to the Army Band, the Army Chorus is a premier male vocal ensemble. Jenkins wrote over 270 arrangements for voice while with the Army Chorus, in addition to several original works. Jenkins is known for his vocal arrangements of well-known Stephen Foster works, such as \"Beautiful Dreamer,\" \"Camptown Races,\" \"Oh! Susanna,\" and \"Some Folks,\" which he wrote for the Army Chorus and remain part of its core repertoire, along with many of his other arrangements.\nJenkins began his position as a tenured Professor of Theory and Composition at the Mary Pappert School of Music, Duquesne University in 1961. At Duquesne, he taught music  theory, orchestration and composition and \"was beloved by his students, colleagues and fellow musicians.\" During his term at Duquesne, Jenkins served as Head of the Theory and Composition Department in the university's School of Music.\n\nMuch of his collected choral works are available as part of Gumberg Library's Music Library Resources, alongside those of jazz guitarist and educator Joe \"Handyman\" Negri, another music educator who also influenced youth (in Mister Rogers' Neighborhood) and mature minds as a professor at Duquesne. LTC John Clanton, former director of the U.S. Army Orchestra and U.S. Army Chorus, stated that Jenkins is \"one of only a handful of composers and arrangers in the entire world who truly understands the musical potential of the male chorus\".\nIn addition to his university teaching, Jenkins influenced students at the primary and secondary school levels as the organist and instrumental music teacher (orchestra director) at St. Edmund's Academy, and by composing works for the orchestra at The Ellis School, both in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He composed works for other elementary and secondary schools, including the Holy Innocents High School of Pittsburgh and the Marlborough School of Los Angeles. Apart from his influence in classrooms, Jenkins participated as organist and choirmaster at Sewickley Presbyterian Church in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, at St. Bernard Catholic Church in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and at Rodef Shalom Congregation in Pittsburgh.\n\n\n== Selected awards ==\nFord Foundation fellowship (administered by the National Music Council) to serve as composer-in-residence Evanston Township High School, Illinois, 1959\nSousa/Ostwald Award: Cumberland Gap Overture, 1961\nASCAP: thirty awards, one every year, 1960-1990\nOmicron Delta Kappa Teacher of the Year Award, 2000\nAmerican Bandmasters Association Award, c. 2007\n\n\n== Musical works ==\n\n\n=== For orchestra ===\n1973 Sinfonia de la Frontera\ntwo symphonies\n1997 \"American Overture\" (transcribed for orchestra from band piece by D.

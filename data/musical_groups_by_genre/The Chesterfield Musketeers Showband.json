The new name and uniform was based on the traditional tale of The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas. The original uniform was designed in partnership with Chesterfield College. 1993 saw the uniform change to the one on show today, with a similar design based on the 1993 film The Three Musketeers. \nFormer members of Carnival Band Secretaries League (1953–1993), they were first crowned League Champions back in 1958 and the success continued with them winning over 250 major Awards over the next six decades.

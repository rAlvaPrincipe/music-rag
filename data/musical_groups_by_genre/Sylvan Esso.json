    "text": "Sylvan Esso is an American electropop duo from Durham, North Carolina which was formed in 2013. The band consists of singer Amelia Meath (born July 2, 1988) and producer Nick Sanborn (born March 8, 1983). They made their debut with the single \"Hey Mami\" and released their eponymous debut album on Partisan Records on May 12, 2014. It reached No. 39 on the Billboard 200. They released their second album, What Now, with Loma Vista Recordings on April 28, 2017, which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album.\nOn August 12, 2022, Sylvan Esso released their fourth studio album, No Rules Sandy, to positive reviews on their Psychic Hotline label.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2012–2013: Formation ===\nLead singer Amelia Meath, who was at the time involved with her trio, Mountain Man, created the vocals to the song called \"Play It Right\". She later met electronic music producer Nick Sanborn (who played bass in band Megafaun) in Milwaukee at the Cactus Club, at the time performing solo as Made of Oak, and asked him to make a rendering of her single, Play It Right, in his own way. From 2012 to 2013 the band slowly formed. Meath had returned from a year-and-a-half tour with Feist and was looking for an affordable place to live, thus landing in Durham with Sanborn and began making their album, with all of their songs being recorded in Sanborn's apartment bedroom. The band derived the first part of its name, \"sylvan\", from a character in an early iOS game titled \"Sword and Sworcery\".\n\n\n=== 2014–2015: Sylvan Esso ===\n\nSylvan Esso is the group's eponymous debut studio album, released May 12, 2014 (2014-05-12) via Partisan Records.

They made their network television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on July 9, 2014, performing the single \"Coffee\". It received considerable airplay in the US, increasing the profile of the band nationally. In August 2015, the band released the single \"H.S.K.T.\", which included a remix by Hercules and Love Affair.\nIn April 2015, Sylvan Esso played both weekends of Coachella.

A video for the latter appeared in January 2017. In late February the group released the single “Die Young” along with a music video and an announcement regarding their new album, titled What Now.\nIn early March 2017, the duo performed at South by Southwest, for NPR Music's showcase.

In the expanded band, Meath and Sanborn were joined by Meg Duffy, Molly Sarlé, Daughter of Swords, Jenn Wasner, Dev Gupta, Adam Schatz, Matt McCaughan, and Joe Westerlund.

The album’s final pre-release single and accompanying video was released September 22, 2020.\nIn explaining Free Love, Sanborn said, “Free Love is the first realization of a thing we've been shooting at for a long time, which is for Sylvan Esso to not feel like two people. [We wanted] it to feel like it was one expression. All of the walls that used to exist between us and divide our roles just slowly came down through the maturity of communication. It's something that you can't have with somebody that you haven't worked with for this long.”\nThe Thursday before the album was released, the band hosted a multimedia art project on their website called Opening Night. The project included a video[3] with a 20 minute improvised modular set by Nick (sampling from the album), interviews with music video directors, various art pieces by Nathaniel Russell, an improvised dance by Emma Portner to \"Numb\", a song dedicated to the band by Jeff Tweedy and a DJ set by Merrill Garbus of Tune-Yards.\nFree Love was released September 25, 2020 via Loma Vista Recordings to positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly described the album as “​... somehow prescient and nostalgic in the same breath. It traffics in intimacy and self-preservation in the face of opening oneself up to love.” UPROXX said the songs on Free Love were “more intimate and cohesive than ever before.” The Line of Best Fit described the album as “ten irregular yet exquisite pearls of synth-pop” and gave the album a 9 out of 10, while Bob Boilen of NPR Music included it on his list of 10 favorite albums of 2020.\nOn November 21, 2020, the duo performed “Rooftop Dancing,” “Ferris Wheel,” and “Ring”from a rooftop in downtown Durham for CBS This Morning.\nA few days later on November 23, Sylvan Esso released their Shaking Out the Numb podcast, a six-episode series centered on the making of Free Love and beyond, made with Rumble Strip producer Erica Heilman.

On June 23 the band released the single \"Your Reality\" and in an interview with Stereogum Sanborn described the first three Sylvan Esso albums as \"a completed trilogy, [with] “Your Reality” as a first glimpse at a new chapter for the band.\"\nOn July 24, 2022, the band released \"Your Reality\" and announced that their fourth studio, titled No Rules Sandy would release three weeks from then on August 12, 2022. The album title is a reference to Nick Sanborn's nickname and the band's ethos for writing the album. The album was recorded in January 2022 at a makeshift studio in a rental house with pickups recorded at their North Carolina studio named Betty's. The album received generally positive reviews, with a score of 75 on Metacritic and Jon Pareles of The New York Times describing the album as having \"spirit of try-anything, knob-twirling whimsy.\"\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nSanborn has cited being inspired by The Books and Boards of Canada, while Meath has said, “We always make records about how the world is dying. They're sad songs that sound really happy.”\nThe New York Times wrote of the duo's singular style, “Sylvan Esso evades the booming, repetitive overkill of typical electronic dance music. Instead, the tracks stay fragile and keep coming deliberately unsprung, defying mechanical regularity.” \n\n\n== Band members ==\nAmelia Meath – vocals, production, lyrics\nNick Sanborn – instrumentals, production\nMeath and Sanborn married in June 2016.\n\n\n== Tours ==\nSylvan Esso Spring 2015 US Tour\nWhat Now Tour\nWITH Tour\nShaking Out The Numb Tour (2021)\nNo Rules Sandy Tour (2023)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\n\n\n==== Live albums ====\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nSlow Motion - \"Phox (Sylvan Esso Remix)\"\nGrouplove - \"I'm With You (Sylvan Esso Remix)\" (2014)\nDie Young - Audion (2017)\nTune-Yards - \"Heart Attack (SYLVAN_ESSO_REMIX_DOTFLAC)\" (2018)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSylvan Esso on Partisan Records label\nSylvan Esso at AllMusic"

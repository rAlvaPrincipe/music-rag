Both members of the duo were vocalists and songwriters, with Rory also playing acoustic guitar. Rory Lee Feek had written singles for other artists prior to the duo's foundation.

The album debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, and No. 61 on the all-genre Billboard 200. Its lead-off single, \"Cheater, Cheater\", was originally recorded by the duo Bomshel. Kristy Osmonson, one-half of that duo, co-wrote the song with the Feeks and Wynn Varble. Bomshel's version was released as a single in early 2008, although it did not chart. Joey + Rory's version was released in September 2008, featuring a music video that included a cameo from Naomi Judd, who had been a judge on Can You Duet. Joey + Rory's version peaked at No. 30 on the country music charts in early 2009. The duo has also appeared in television commercials for the online retailer Overstock.com in late 2008. In February 2009, the duo was nominated for the Academy of Country Music Awards Top Vocal Duo. Although a cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Free Bird\" was originally to have been released as the second single, it was withdrawn after two weeks, and replaced in March 2009 with \"Play the Song\", which failed to chart. The album's third single, \"To Say Goodbye\", was released to radio on July 27, 2009, debuting at number 54 as Billboard Magazine's \"Hot Shot Debut\" on the \"Hot Country Songs\" chart.\nJoey + Rory released their first holiday single, the Carl Jackson-produced \"It's Christmas Time,\" on November 16, 2009, to country radio and November 24, 2009, to digital retailers.

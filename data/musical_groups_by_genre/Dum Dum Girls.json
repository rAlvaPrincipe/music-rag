    "text": "Dum Dum Girls was an American rock band, formed in 2008. It began as the bedroom recording project of singer and songwriter Dee Dee (née Kristin Gundred). She is currently based in Los Angeles. The name is a double homage to the Vaselines' album Dum Dum and the Iggy Pop song \"Dum Dum Boys\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first release under the Dum Dum Girls moniker was a five-song CDR on her own label, Zoo Music, in late 2008. It was followed by an EP on Captured Tracks and a 7-inch on HoZac Records She quickly gained attention with these releases and signed to Sub Pop in July 2009.\nDum Dum Girls' debut album, I Will Be, was released in March 2010 and was well received by critics. Pitchfork described the songs as \"genuine earworms, both unfailingly hip and often wonderfully associative\". Dee Dee produced the record with Richard Gottehrer, who had previously worked with Richard Hell, Blondie, the Go-Gos and the Raveonettes. Gottehrer also co-wrote the early 1960s hit songs \"My Boyfriend's Back\" and \"I Want Candy\". The record included guest guitarists Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs on \"Yours Alone\"; Dee Dee's ex-husband, Brandon Welchez of Crocodiles, on \"Blank Girl\"; and Andrew Miller on multiple tracks. The cover of the album featured a college snapshot of Dee Dee's mother, who died from cancer in 2010. After its release, Dee Dee assembled a touring band, and their first shows were in support of Girls.\nIn 2011, the EP He Gets Me High was released, which included a cover of \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" by the Smiths. This record marked the addition of Sune Rose Wagner of the Raveonettes to the production team.\nSecond album Only in Dreams was released in September 2011, featuring the singles \"Coming Down\" and \"Bedroom Eyes\". This album is the only Dum Dum Girls recording to feature the full band. On December 1, 2011, Dum Dum Girls performed \"Bedroom Eyes\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\nIn September 2012, the EP End of Daze was released, preceded by the single \"Lord Knows\" on July 31, 2012, which Pitchfork awarded \"Best New Track\". The EP received \"Best New Music\" from Pitchfork as well.\nOn October 31, 2013, Dum Dum Girls announced their third full-length album Too True, set for release on January 28, 2014 and featuring the single \"Lost Boys & Girls Club\", whose video premiered with H&M on October 31, 2013. For this album, Dee Dee cited Suede, Blondie, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Pretenders, Madonna and the Stone Roses as her influences.\nOn December 5, 2014, Converse released a Dum Dum Girls split single, \"On Christmas\", as the third part of three digital installments of the company's holiday-themed compilation EP, Noise to the World 2.\n\n\n== Other projects ==\nThe Mayfair Set, a duo with Mike Sniper of Blank Dogs, released an eponymous single followed by the Young One 12-inch EP, both in 2009.\nDee Dee and Tamaryn released a cover of the Jesus and Mary Chain song \"Teenage Lust\" in 2011 under the name Les Demoniaques. Also that year, Dee Dee, Sniper and J.B. Townsend of Crystal Stilts recorded a one-sided 7-inch single, \"Faraway Friend,\" under the name Zodiacs, which was given away via Captured Tracks mail order. Dee Dee and her husband released a 2013 single, \"Something That Feels Bad Is Something That Feels Good\", as Haunted Hearts, followed by the Initiation full-length in 2014.\nIn 2012, Dum Dum Girls drummer Sandra Vu created the band Sisu, which she described as combining \"echo-ridden, cold, distorted synth sounds—with pop melodies\".\nIn 2013, Dee Dee composed the opening theme for the animated series Beware the Batman.\nShe was also featured on \"Play for Today\", a duet from Belle and Sebastian's 2015 album, Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance.\nIn May 2015, Dee Dee and collaborator UUV/Andrew Miller released a single, \"Is There Any Other One?\", as HUNI.

In recent years, the quartet has made appearances with numerous well-renowned musicians including Emanuel Ax, Marc-André Hamelin, Inon Barnatan, Elisso Virsaladze, Paul Coletti, Paul Neubauer, Noah Bendix-Balgley, Hila Plitmann, David Shifrin, and Roberto Díaz.\nThe quartet is currently based in New York City, in-residence at the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center Bowers Program from 2024 to 2027.\n\n\n== Origin of Name ==\n\"Viano\" is a portmanteau. According to the group, the name \"Viano\" symbolizes how the four individual instruments of a string quartet (with each instrument beginning with the letter \"v\") work harmoniously as one, like a piano, creating a \"unified instrument\" called the \"Viano\".\n\n\n== References =="

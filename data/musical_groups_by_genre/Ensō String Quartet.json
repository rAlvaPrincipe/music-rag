Strad Magazine called Ensō's debut recording \"an auspicious start to their recording career\" and its recording of Ginastera's quartets was nominated for a Grammy Award, with Music Web International calling it \"playing of jaw-dropping prowess revealing masterpieces of the 20th century quartet literature\". The disc was selected as one of Music Web's Recordings of the Year for 2009.\nIn the 2009/10 season the Ensō won a Chamber Music America Commissioning Grant with composer Kurt Stallmann for a new piece for string quartet and electronics. Since the quartet's inception in 1999, new music featured prominently – from winning the Piece-de-Concert prize at the Banff Competition for the best performance of the commissioned piece to premiering Joan Tower's Piano Quintet to making premiere recordings released on Albany Records of works by composers Anthony Brandt and Karim al-Zand.\nThe Ensō Quartet's members also taught and coached chamber music.

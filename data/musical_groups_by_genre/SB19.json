    "text": "SB19 is a Filipino boy band formed in 2018, consisting of Pablo, Josh, Stell, Ken, and Justin. They are noted for their contributions to the contemporary Pinoy pop scene. Now a self-managed group under 1Z Entertainment, a company they established, SB19 members are actively involved in the creative process, including songwriting, choreography, music video direction, and production.\nAfter several years as trainees, SB19 debuted in 2018 with the single \"Tilaluha\". They received little attention from the public until the video of their dance rehearsal for their song \"Go Up\" went viral in late 2019. This led them to strategically use social media to expand their reach and recognition as well as to increase their fandom. They became the first Southeast Asian act to be nominated on the Billboard Music Awards, and the first Southeast Asian act to make an appearance in the top 10 of the Billboard Social 50. For their significant contributions in pioneering Philippine pop music to the global scene, SB19 has been dubbed the \"Kings of P-pop\" by the public and various media. The group promotes its music as part of Pinoy pop, a sub-genre of Original Pilipino Music.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe letters in the group's name were taken from the initials of their former Korean management company, ShowBT. The number 19 is derived from the country calling codes of South Korea (+82) and of the Philippines (+63)- the difference of 82 and 63, and the sum of the digits (8 + 2 + 6 + 3). It symbolized the collaboration of the two countries in the formation of the group. The members themselves, however, used the phrase \"Sound Break\"—for the goal to \"break into the music scene\"\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2018–2020: Formation and first album ===\nIn 2016, ShowBT Philippines, a subsidiary of the Korean company ShowBT Group, conducted a talent search for performers, with the aim of localizing K-pop in other Asian countries.\nThe candidates went through a difficult South Korean-inspired training camp, including physical training and \"personality development\". Trainees who were judged inadequate were sent home, until the final seven members were chosen. The training continued, with over-nine-hour work days; of the seven members, Stell remained with ShowBT, three quit, and Pablo, Josh, and Justin left but changed their minds laters. Ken, a previous candidate, also joined the group. These five became the current members of SB19. Pablo—initially using the stage name Sejun—is the band's leader.\nSB19 debuted on October 26, 2018, with the single \"Tilaluha\", a sentimental ballad. It was followed by their fast-paced second single \"Go Up\", which was released on July 19, 2019. The group received little attention following this regrouping, and its members began to grow disheartened. They were on the verge of deciding to disband but several months after the song was released, their dance practice video of the song went viral on Twitter and Facebook, and SB19 was able to secure spots on Philippine television and radio. The newly found opportunity led them to use social media as a strategy to gain recognition and start planning a tour.\nOn November 20, 2019, SB19 became the first Filipino act to appear on the Billboard Next Big Sound chart. They also became the first Filipino act to enter the Billboard Social 50, debuting at number 28 on the week of December 28, 2019. Jeff Benjamin of Billboard noted that a growing international fan-base had aided their appearance in the chart. He added that \"more artists [will] continue to look East for inspiration and a larger audience\".\n\nWhen a free nationwide concert tour for 2019 and ticket sales were opened for their concert in Cuneta Astrodome in Pasay, tickets quickly sold out in three minutes. They were able perform in three other cities - Silay, Cagayan de Oro and Legazpi. However, the planned concerts to be held in other major cities in the Philippines were indefinitely postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn December 2019, Sony Music Philippines signed a recording contract with the group, and on the same day, the group released their third single, \"Alab (Burning)\", under the new record label.\nOn March 9, 2020, SB19 was added to the roster of artists of Spotify's RADAR Program, which supports new artists through marketing campaigns. The quintet released their debut album Get in the Zone, featuring nine tracks, including three released singles and two unreleased tracks, on July 31, 2020. Two weeks after the release of the album, SB19 achieved its highest position on the Social 50 chart at number two on the week of August 15. A week later, the group peaked at number five on the Emerging Artist chart.\nOn November 21, they held their first-ever online concert streamed live via the platform Global Live. It was later re-broadcast on November 28 as a fundraiser event for the communities affected by recent typhoons.\nOn December 3, SB19 appeared at number six on Billboard Year-End Social 50 chart, making them the first Southeast Asian act to reach the top 10 of the magazine's annual chart.\n\n\n=== 2021–2022: Pagsibol ===\n\nThe group released \"What?\" on March 9, 2021, as the first single off their upcoming extended play, initially planned to be released in June 2021.

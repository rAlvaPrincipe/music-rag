    "text": "Brethren is an Australian hip hop duo from Sydney formed in 1989. The group comprises Matthew Peet a.k.a. \"Mistery\" and Claude Rodriguez a.k.a. Wizdm. They have released two albums, two EPs and a number of singles and collaborations. They have performed live locally, notably at festivals including The Big Day Out, Livid and Blackstump Music Festival.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMistery and Wizdm first met in 1989 at the Heavenly Taste Pizza shop in Sydney, where Mistery was working at the time. They realised they had mutual interests in hip-hop, B-Boying and spirituality and decided to form Brethren.\nBrethren got their first big break in the hip hop scene courtesy of Sereck from the Australian hip hop group Def Wish Cast. Sereck secured a spot for Brethren at a Kinselas Jams gig, organised by Scott Wolf and Code Blue from (then) Sound Unlimited.\nFrom then on they started performing at underground gigs on a regular basis and also started running workshops at youth centres and community events throughout Sydney.\nIn 1992, they appeared on the debut album Knights of the Underground Table by Def Wish Cast. This album was the first full length Australian hip hop album.\nBrethren recorded their first four-song demo on cassette in 1992. The recording was very popular and circulated quickly throughout the grassroots industry.\nThe demo came to the attention of TV show Simon Townsend's Wonder World who offered to make a video clip for their song \"Crusin\". The clip went on to be played on TV shows – rage, Channel 3 and Channel 31 (Australia). It was also a crucial part of a locally produced production Spooky Tricks that sold internationally.\nThe demo also came to the attention of a subsidiary of Mushroom Records called MDS who backed Brethren so that they could release their first CD; the Big Brother EP in 1996. This resulted in Brethren becoming one of the first commercially signed hip hop groups in Australia.\nIn August 1996, Brethren performed tracks from their Big Brother album at Bomb Australia's B-Boy Kingdom 2 – a hip hop jam in Brisbane, alongside Warcry (Gold Coast).\nIn 1996, while Mistery was touring overseas, Wizdm recorded and produced his first solo album Words of Wizdm.\nIn 1997 Brethren released the single \"Slingshot\" which received airplay on Triple J and featured on the compilation Homebrews 2.\nIn 1998 they appeared in the first Australian hip hop documentary Basic Equipment which was broadcast on ABC TV during the government supported youth culture themed Loud Festival. The film was made by Paul Fenech (creator of SBS' Pizza series) and narrated by Sereck from Def Wish Cast. The film featured a range of prominent artists in the Sydney hip hop scene.\nIn 2000 Brethren joined the label Mustard Records and launched a compilation project In Da Midst, which featured 18 tracks from emerging artists from Australia and New Zealand. The project coincided with a national tour that saw Brethren team up with acclaimed US hip-hop artist, Vex Da Vortex, from the group BoogieMonsters.\nIn 2004 Brethren released their first full-length album Beyond Underground. The album was produced by Wizdm, and included guest appearances by some Australian hip-hop artists; Morganics, Sereck, Sleeping Monk, Hoodsta, Mass Mc and DJs Nic Toth, Diggz, Flagrant and Nino Brown.\nThe album was the first ever Australian hip-hop concept album and took 3 years to complete. Each track on the album depicted a part of an original sci-fi story written by Brethren, with inspiration drawn from films such as Journey to the Center of the Earth, War of the Worlds, and Mad Max. The album was released with a limited edition full size comic book, with illustrations by Mistery, which depicted the story line from each track.\nSince the group's formation, Mistery and Wizdm have been heavily involved in promoting MCing, graff and breaking to teenagers and up and coming artists in the hip hop scene. Maya Jupiter, another Australian hip hop artist and ex-radio broadcaster has publicly acknowledged the support of Mistery in her early career.\n\n\n== Current projects ==\nBrethren continue to support a range of community organisations through workshops and mentoring programs, and act as ambassadors for programs such as Musicians Making A Difference. According to Wizdm \"We feel that giving something positive back to the community is very important to us because when we were young there was nothing like what we have now, youth centres and under age shows etc... we want to show young people what they are capable of.\"\nSince 2006 Mistery has led a Christian hip hop movement Krosswerdz known colloquially as the \"hip-hop church\". Krosswerdz runs creative arts programs for young people, collaboration projects for artists in the gospel music and hip hop scene, as well as monthly faith-based services. Wizdm continues to work as a beat-producer and mentor for many Australian emcees.\nFor the past few years both Wizdm and Mistery have been working on individual solo albums, Unrelenting, and Way of the Warrior as well as a 20-year Brethren anniversary album Bastion. Unrelenting and Bastion were released in 2009 through Krosswerdz Recordings, with Way of the Warrior following in 2013.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Brethren releases ===\n\n\n==== Albums ====\nBeyond Underground – Mustard Records (2004)\nBastion – Krosswerdz Recordings (20 November 2009)\n\n\n==== EPs ====\nBrethren (1992) Cassette\nBig Brother – MDS (1994)\n\n\n==== Singles ====\n\"Slingshot\" – MDS (1995)\n\n\n=== Contributions ===\n\n\n==== Compilation albums ====\nMY MY (1994) (songs: \"Checkin the neck\", \"Brotherhood\")\nHomebrews 2 (1998) (song:\"Slingshot\")\nBasic Equipment (1998) (song: \"Flow\") Vinyl record\nThe Aussie Hip Hop Army (2003) (song: \"Overflow\")\nThe Four Elements Effect (1999) (song: \"Sydney represents\")\nIn Da Midst (2000) (songs:\"In Da Midst\", \"Rhyme Travellers\", \"The late 80s\")\nIn Da Midst Headcleaner Vol 1 (2000) (song:\"On a mission\")\nHip Hop A Place of Peace (2001) (song: \"The Vision\")\nCulture of Kings V2 (2002) (song: \"Versustyle\")\nBattle of the year (2003) (commentary about BBoying)\nScratching Dreams (2004) (song: \"On a Mission\")\n1994–2004 – Creative Vibes (2004)(song: \"Intercepta\")\nIn Da Midst Headcleaner Vol 2 (2005)\nHip Hop Show (2005) (song: \"Man Machine\")\nAustralian Hip Hop (2005) (songs: \"Deep Within\", \"Intercepta\", \"Bear Witness\")\n\n\n==== Guest appearances ====\nKnights of the Underground Table – Def Wish Cast (song: \"Saga Iron Fest\")\nSoulkeepers – Infiltration (2000) (song: \"Time Crisis\")\nStorm Troop – The Invasion (2005) (songs: \"Combinations\", \"Unorthodox\")\nFonke Knomaads – Cleopatra's Bath Milk (2008) (song: \"How did we get here\")\n\n\n==== Production credits (Wizdm) ====\nEvicted from the Projects (community project)\nThe sun will still come out tomorrow – Jobi One (includes Wizdm guest vocals) (2000) Album\nIt is what it is – Oakbridge (2009) Album\n\n\n== References =="

They are one of the most prominent blues rock acts of the Serbian and Yugoslav rock scenes.\n\n\n== History ==\nZona B was officially formed on 29 November 1987 by vocalist Jovan \"Lole\" Savić, guitarist Tomislav Rakijaš, drummer Dušan Ristić and keyboardist Vladimir Filipović. The band had their first performance in February 1988 in Mašinac club in Belgrade. After several lineup changes, the band's lineup was complete with the arrival of bass guitarist Zdenko Kolar, a former member of the new wave band Idoli, and Dušan \"Duda\" Bezuha, a former member of the rock bands Tilt and Suncokret.\nIn 1991. the band released their debut album, entitled Bestseller, through PGP-RTB. The album was produced by Bezuha (which would be the case will all of the band's future studio releases) and featured cover versions of blues and rock classics, like Ten Years After's \"Love Like a Man\", Fleetwood Mac's \"Oh Well\", J.J. Cale's \"Cocaine\", The Nashville Teens' \"Tobacco Road\", Howlin' Wolf's \"Spoonful\", and others. Guest appearances on the album featured Bebi Dol on vocals and Petar \"Pera Joe\" Miladinović (of Blues Trio) on harmonica.\nDuring Zona B's work on their following studio album, Filipović left the band. The band's second studio album, entitled Juke-Box, was recorded with guest keyboardist Saša Lokner (of Bajaga i Instruktori), who played Hammond organ on the recording, and released in 1993 through PGP-RTS.

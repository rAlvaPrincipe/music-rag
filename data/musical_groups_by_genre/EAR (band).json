    "text": "Experimental Audio Research (commonly shortened to E.A.R. or EAR) is an experimental music collective formed around Peter Kember (a.k.a. Sonic Boom), formerly of Spacemen 3.  While Spacemen 3 were a relatively traditional rock and roll band with strong experimental leanings, E.A.R. is essentially a free improvisation project, creating instrumental music characterized by lengthy, droning textures and slowly evolving structures.\nThe line-up often included Sonic Boom (Spectrum, Spacemen 3), Kevin Martin (God), Kevin Shields (My Bloody Valentine), and Eddie Prévost (AMM). Past collaborators include Lawrence Chandler of Bowery Electric, Nick Kramer, Delia Derbyshire and Thomas Köner, plus various members of Spectrum, though it is generally considered a Kember solo project. The collective is one of Kember's several post-Spacemen 3 projects, which also include Spectrum, as well albums released under the Sonic Boom moniker.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nMesmerised (Space Age Recordings, 1994)\nBeyond The Pale (Big Cat, 1996, recorded 1992)\nPhenomena 256 (Space Age Recordings, 1996)\nThe Köner Experiment (Space Age Recordings, 1997)\nMillennium Music (Atavistic Records, 1998)\nPestrepeller (Ochre Records, 1999)\nData Rape (Space Age Recordings, 2000)\nLive At The Dream Palace (Ochre Records, 2000)\nVibrations (Rocket Girl, 2000)\nContinuum (Space Age Recordings, 2001)\nWorn To A Shadow (Lumberton Trading Company, 2005)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nFalling / Tail Chaser (Sympathy For The Record Industry, 1995)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nKember's Trouser Press entry"

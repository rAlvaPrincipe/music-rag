    "text": "NCT (Korean: 엔시티; RR: Ensiti; an acronym for Neo Culture Technology) is a South Korean boy band formed and managed by SM Entertainment. Introduced in January 2016, the group consists of 25 members divided into six different sub-units: NCT U, NCT 127, NCT Dream, WayV, NCT DoJaeJung, and NCT Wish. They are known for their versatility in music, vocal and rap abilities, and powerful performances, and have been cited as K-pop's \"most experimental boy band\" due to their concept of having limitless members. As of June 2024, NCT has recorded more than 40 million album sales in Korea across all sub-units, making them the best-selling act under SM Entertainment and one of the best-selling K-pop artists of all time.\nThe group debuted their first sub-unit, the rotational NCT U, on April 9, 2016, with the double digital single \"The 7th Sense\" and \"Without You\". It was followed by the Seoul-based sub-unit NCT 127 on July 7, 2016, with their eponymous extended play and the then-teenaged sub-unit NCT Dream on August 24, 2016, with the digital single \"Chewing Gum\". WayV, a seven-member sub-unit based in China and NCT's first overseas sub-unit, debuted on January 17, 2019, with the single album The Vision. On April 17, 2023, a new fixed sub-unit featuring members Doyoung, Jaehyun, and Jungwoo debuted as NCT DoJaeJung with the extended play (EP) Perfume. NCT's next overseas unit, NCT Wish, debuted in 2024 as their final overseas subunit.\nAlthough each sub-unit promotes separately, NCT has united four times as a group to record four full-length albums: Empathy (2018), Resonance (2020), Universe (2021), and Golden Age (2023). Within two months of release, Resonance sold over 2.6 million copies across its two parts, becoming the highest-selling physical album released by an act from SM Entertainment at the time and earning the group their first Daesang (Grand Prize) Award at the 2020 Asia Artist Awards. Universe, which was released in December 2021, became their most pre-ordered album at 1.7 million copies, and later surpassed 1.8 million sales after its release.\n\n\n== Background and name ==\nIn January 2016, SM Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man delivered a presentation at the SM Coex Artium titled \"SMTOWN: New Culture Technology 2016\". The label planned to debut a new boy group that would \"fall in line\" with their culture contents strategy, one that would contain an \"unlimited\" number of members that would debut in separate sub-units within the group. Furthermore, the members would form \"sub-unit teams\" and have \"collaborations\" with each other. The name of the group was later revealed to be NCT, an acronym for the presentation title. NCT as a whole was SM Entertainment's first idol group to debut in nearly two years since Red Velvet in 2014 and SM Entertainment's first boy group to debut since Exo in 2012.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2013–2016: Formation and pre-debut activities ===\n\nPrior to joining SM Entertainment, some of the members were already involved in the entertainment industry. Jeno appeared in various commercials as a child. Jisung was a child actor and filmed movies such as Boys, Be Curious (2012) and Go, Stop, Murder (2013). Chenle was active on the Chinese music scene as a singer from 2009 to 2015; he released three albums and headlined a concert in China. In 2011, Yuta participated in the singing competition \"Juice Winter Collection\" in Japan, while Ten competed on the Thai TV show Teen Superstar under the name TNT. Xiaojun was a singing contestant on the Zhejiang TV program X-Fire in November 2015.\nJohnny, Yuta, Ten, Mark and Renjun joined the company via SM Global Auditions, while the remaining members were discovered through street casting, personal recommendation, community entertainment shows, and local auditions. Prior to their debut as members of NCT, 19 of the 23 overall members of NCT were introduced as part of SM Rookies, a group of trainees under SM Entertainment created in December 2013. The first members of NCT to be introduced were Taeyong and Jeno. Sixteen other members were introduced through SM Rookies until early January 2016.\nTaeyong released the short rap track \"Open the Door\" in July 2014 and featured on Red Velvet's second single \"Be Natural\" in October of the same year. He appeared alongside Johnny, Yuta, Ten, Jaehyun, Mark, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin and Jisung on the Mnet-produced Exo 90:2014, a show starring labelmates Exo, where they performed dances to K-pop songs from the 1990s. Some members appeared in various Exo music video remakes in the same year. From January through June 2015, Doyoung and Jaehyun were the hosts of the music show Show Champion; from July through December of that year, Yuta was a Japanese representative on Abnormal Summit, a series in which non-Korean men debate Korean culture.

In October 2016, Johnny participated in the music festival \"Spectrum Dance Music Festival\" as an SM Dreamstation Crew DJ.\nSM Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man held a presentation at the SM Coex Artium titled \"SM Town: Neo Culture Technology 2016\" on January 28, 2016, where he outlined the company's plans for a new boy group in line with their \"culture contents\" strategy that would debut different teams based in different cities and countries around the world.\n\n\n=== 2016–2018: Debut of NCT U, NCT 127 and NCT Dream and first collaborative project ===\n\nOn April 4, 2016, SM Entertainment announced NCT's first sub-unit would be NCT U, meaning \"NCT United\", which then consisted of six members: Taeil, Taeyong, Doyoung, Ten, Jaehyun and Mark. NCT U released the digital singles \"The 7th Sense\" on April 9 and \"Without You\" in two versions on April 10 (a Korean version sung by Taeil, Doyoung, and Jaehyun and a Chinese version with the addition of SM Rookies' Kun). On April 9, NCT U made their first broadcast appearance with NCT On Air on V Live hosted by Super Junior's Kim Hee-chul.

NCT topped Billboard's Emerging Artists chart on May 5, marking the first time that a K-pop act had led the list.\nMark graduated from NCT Dream after the release of their second EP, We Go Up, in September. On September 11, Xiaojun was the first of the then-undebuted WayV members to be introduced through SM Rookies, with Hendery and Yangyang following on September 13 and September 15, respectively. Jungwoo was added to NCT 127 in October, with the release of their first studio album, Regular-Irregular. Winwin did not participate in promotional activities of the album's reissue, Regulate, in order to prepare for his debut with WayV, and his activities in NCT 127 have been discontinued since then.\n\n\n=== 2019–2020: Debut of WayV, NCT Dream restructure and NCT 2020 Resonance ===\n\nOn December 31, 2018, SM Entertainment announced NCT's fourth sub-unit, WayV (Chinese: 威神V; pinyin: Wēi shén V) under Label V. The unit would be based in China and consists of seven members: Kun, Winwin, Ten, Lucas, Hendery, Xiaojun and Yangyang.

Their debut single album, The Vision, was released digitally and included a Chinese version of NCT 127's \"Come Back\" and an original song titled \"Dream Launch\". On December 13, NCT U (consisting of Taeil, Doyoung, Jaehyun and Haechan) released \"Coming Home\" as part of the SM Station X project. After wrapping up album promotions for their EP Reload in April, NCT Dream abandoned their original concept in which members \"graduate\" from the sub-unit upon reaching age of majority (20 in Korean age reckoning, 19 internationally) and continued as seven members, with Mark returning to the lineup.\n\nIn September, NCT announced a reunion for a second group project, NCT 2020, in October 2020. The first part of their second album, NCT 2020 Resonance Pt. 1, was released on October 12.

    "text": "The London Classical Players (LCP) was a British orchestra that specialized in music following historically informed performance (HIP) practices and orchestral performances on period musical instruments.  Sir Roger Norrington founded the LCP in 1978. From 1978 to 1992, the concertmaster of the London Classical Players was baroque violinist John Holloway. The LCP made a variety of recordings for EMI Classics.  Many of the players in the LCP overlapped with four other major HIP orchestral ensembles, the Academy of Ancient Music, the English Concert, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, and the English Baroque Soloists.\nAmong their famous concert series was \"The Beethoven Experience\" in 1987, and \"The Berlioz Experience\" in 1988.  In 1996, the LCP was invited to open the Prague Spring Festival in the traditional opening festival concert of Bedrich Smetana's Ma Vlast, a controversial decision at the time.\nIn 1997 the LCP formally dissolved and its work was absorbed into the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\nLudwig van Beethoven: The Nine Symphonies, Virgin Classics 5619432 (reissue)\nLudwig van Beethoven: The Five Piano Concertos, Virgin Classics 5622422 (reissue)\nHector Berlioz: Symphonie fantastique, Overture Les Francs-Juges, Virgin Classics 3632862 (reissue)\nJohannes Brahms: Ein deutsches Requiem, Virgin Veritas 5616052 (reissue)\nAnton Bruckner: Symphony No. 3, Virgin Veritas 4820912 (reissue)\nGeorg Friedrich Handel: Water Music, Music for the Royal Fireworks, Virgin Veritas (reissue)\nJoseph Haydn: Symphonies Nos. 99 and 100 (EMI Classics), 101 and 102 (EMI Classics), 103 and 104 (EMI Classics)\nFelix Mendelssohn: Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4, Virgin Veritas 3499832 (reissue)\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart:\nSymphonies Nos. 38- 41, Virgin Veritas 5620102 (reissue)\nDie Zauberflöte, Virgin Veritas 4820732\nDon Giovanni, Virgin Veritas 5622672 (reissue with Die Zauberflöte)\nPiano Concertos Nos. 20, 23–25, Virgin Veritas 5623432 (reissue)\nRequiem/Masonic Funeral Music/\"Ave verum corpus\", Virgin Veritas 5615202\nHenry Purcell: The Fairy Queen, Virgin Veritas 5619552\nGioacchino Rossini: Overtures, EMI Classics\nFranz Schubert: Symphonies Nos. 4-6 and 8, Virgin Veritas 5622272 (reissue)\nRobert Schumann: Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4, Virgin Veritas 3499832 (reissue)\nBedřich Smetana: Ma Vlast, Virgin Veritas 5453012\nRichard Wagner: Preludes to Rienzi, Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg and Parsifal, Prelude and Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde, Act III Prelude to Lohengrin, Siegfried Idyll, Virgin Veritas 4820912 (reissue)\nCarl Maria von Weber: Symphonies Nos. 1 and 2, Konzertstück, EMI Classics\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBernard Holland, \"Review/Music; The Beethoven Influences: He on Today, Today on Him\".

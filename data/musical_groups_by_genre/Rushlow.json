    "text": "Rushlow was an American country music band founded in 2003. Its members were Tim Rushlow (lead vocals), Doni Harris (banjo, acoustic guitar, vocals), Kurt Allison (acoustic guitar, electric guitar, vocals), Tully Kennedy (bass guitar, vocals), Rich Redmond (drums), and Billy Welch (keyboards). Prior to the band's foundation, Rushlow was lead singer of Little Texas until 1997, and a solo artist between then and 2001.\nSigned to Lyric Street Records in 2003, Rushlow released two singles and one album (Right Now) on the label that year. Rushlow and Harris later recorded as the duo Rushlow Harris for the Show Dog Nashville label in 2006. After disbanding, Kennedy, Allison, and Redmond became members of Jason Aldean's road band; they, along with David Fanning, also founded the record producer team New Voice Entertainment.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBefore the foundation of Rushlow, lead vocalist Tim Rushlow was lead singer of the band Little Texas. In 1997, when they disbanded, Tim Rushlow left for a solo career. His first cut was the musical track \"Totally Committed\" on comedian Jeff Foxworthy's 1998 album of the same name. Tim Rushlow signed to Atlantic Records in 2000, charting the Top Ten single \"She Misses Him\" that year. Other singles from his self-titled debut album, however, failed to make Top 40, due in part to the closure of his label in 2001. He formed the group Rushlow after deciding that he was not made for a solo career, saying: \"I did some shows and I had a band and a bus, but I never felt real comfortable as the Tim Rushlow solo guy with this band that was not named, that was just sort of 'Tim's backup band.' It just never really felt right.\"\nOne of the group's first members was Rushlow's cousin Doni Harris, who had previously sung backing vocals on his solo album. Later, Rushlow and Harris had spotted Kurt Allison, as well as Allison's roommates Rich Redmond and Tully Kennedy, all of whom were backing another singer at a bar, and eventually Billy Welch was added to the lineup as well. The group was signed to Lyric Street Records, on the condition that they assume the name Rushlow and perform as a self-contained band, with no additional studio musicians. The lead-off single, \"I Can't Be Your Friend\", was a Top 20 country hit in 2003, and the group also entertained U.S. troops in Bahrain, Germany, Italy and Spain. The song served as the lead-off to Rushlow's debut album Right Now, which produced only one more chart single on the country charts.\n\n\n=== 2006â€“2007: Rushlow Harris ===\nIn 2006, Rushlow and Harris recorded as Rushlow Harris. The duo signed to Show Dog Nashville, a label owned by country singer Toby Keith. Working with producer Christy DiNapoli and Derek Bason, the duo released two singles but no album.\nKennedy, Allison, and Redmond now play in Jason Aldean's road band and produce with David Fanning as the production team New Voice Entertainment. Welch is the keyboardist in Jake Owen's road band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== As Rushlow ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\n\n\n==== Singles ====\n\n\n==== Music videos ====\n\n\n=== As Rushlow Harris ===\n\n\n==== Singles ====\n\n\n==== Music videos ====\n\n\n== References =="

This would be followed by several singles over the next year: \"Open Me Up\", \"Drown\", \"Lover That Waits\" and \"Whirlwind\". All five singles formed the EP Whirlwind, released on 15 July 2022 to coincide with the single of the same name.\nThey are currently based in London, England.\nIn December 2022, Star Kendrick announced that Toma Banjanin would be taking a step back from Geowulf, effectively turning it into Kendrickâ€™s solo musical project.

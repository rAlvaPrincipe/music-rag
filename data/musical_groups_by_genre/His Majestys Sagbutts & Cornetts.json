    "text": "His Majestys Sagbutts & Cornetts (HMSC) is a British early music group founded in 1982. The ensemble presently consists of three cornetts and four sackbuts, with chamber organ or harpsichord. The group frequently collaborates with other instrumentalists and singers, and has an extensive discography on Hyperion Records and other labels.\n\n\n== History ==\nHMSC's first concert was on 3 September 1982 at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, London, with guest soloist Richard Wistreich. Meridian Records expressed their interest in recording the group as early as the interval of that first concert.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe original line-up was cornettists Jeremy West, David Staff and sackbut players Sue Addison, Richard Cheetham, Paul Nieman and Stephen Saunders. Each member attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, with the exception of Addison.

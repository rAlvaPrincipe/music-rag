    "text": "Tiger Shadow are an English alternative hip hop band from Leeds, composed of Jim Tycho (synthesizers, bass, guitar, backing vocals, orchestration) and Komla MC (lyrics, lead vocals, drum programming & percussion).  They have also performed live with singer Lynsey Cawthra, guitarists Ser Nik and Dave Pearson, as well as drummers and percussionists Sheikh Sticks and Karim Nashar.\nKomla was born in Ghana where he spent most of his childhood, and moved to England in his teenage years. Jim Tycho is originally from Southport (near Liverpool). They both met in Leeds in approximately 2001 while jamming with mutual friends and have continued to make music together ever since.  The band officially formed in early 2008 and are described as a genre-crossing collective mixing electronica and jazz with hip hop, while also including elements of funk, reggae, trip hop, indie and world music.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nTiger Shadow were formed in July 2008 after Jim & Komla had entered home recordings of \"Terracotta Blues\" and \"Star Chaser\" into a competition for Sandman magazine, which they won and this gave them their first gigs as a band at Reading & Leeds Festivals for BBC Introducing on 22 & 23 August 2008. Tiger Shadow did not exist as a band when the winning email was received, so Jim & Komla looked to musicians who they were working with at the time, and some with whom they had collaborated with for the previous 10 years, to form the first version of the band specifically to play at Reading & Leeds. Karim Nashar was drafted on drums / percussion; Dave Pearson on lead guitar; Kully Manik on guitar / bass and Lynsey Cawthra on vocals. Komla MC performed vox / drums / percussion and Jim Tycho completed this line-up on guitar / bass and programmed synths. Between 18 July and 22 August 2008, the band was formed and material was written / completed for performance at the festivals.\n\n\n== The Rise of the Tiger Shadow ==\nAfter the Leeds and Reading festivals were complete, Komla, Jim, Dave & Karim decided to record an album. September 2008 to January 2009 were spent writing and rehearsing new material. Between February and March 2009, The Rise of the Tiger Shadow was recorded at Cottage Road Studios in Headingley, Leeds by Matt Peel and Andy Hawkins. This was released through the band's own record label (Tiger Shadow Music) via AWAL, and became available on iTunes and a number of other electronic stores from 20 April 2009.\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\nW’Happen – 3:32\nThis Is the Future – 4:14\nVernacular Spectacular – 3:22\nWhat Do You Know About It? – 4:48\nEscape – 3:14\nNarration – 2:58\nStar Chaser – 3:58\nTerracotta Blues – 3:48\nIron Filings – 3:52\nThat's Because It Is... - 3:32\nHold On Tightly – 4:56\n\n\n== Stripe 1 EP ==\nAfter the first album, the band decided to experiment with their sound and this resulted in the concept of a series of EPs which would be used as test-beds for different approaches to making their music, bringing out the numerous sonic aspects of the band. \nThe first EP, Stripe 1, was recorded at Cottage Road Studios with producer Matt Peel in September 2009. This was released through the band's own record label (Tiger Shadow Music) via AWAL, and became available on iTunes and a number of other electronic stores from 2 November 2009. This EP marked a gradual move away from the rock / hip-hop combination of the first album, and started to see the introduction of a more electronic sound to the band, particularly via the use of the Korg Electribe EM-1.\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\nUp & Down – 3:34\nI Knew You'd Be Alright – 3:06\nSee You Next Tuesday – 4:04\n\n\n== Stripe 2 EP ==\nStripe 2 was recorded at Cottage Road Studios with producer Matt Peel in March 2010.

This EP was recorded by just Jim Tycho and Komla MC using programmed electronic drums and it marks the completion of the band's transition from Rock / Hip-Hop to Hip-Hop / Electronica.

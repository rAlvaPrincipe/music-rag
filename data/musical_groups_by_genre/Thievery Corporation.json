    "text": "Thievery Corporation is an American electronic music duo consisting of Rob Garza and Eric Hilton. Their musical style mixes elements of dub, acid jazz, reggae, Indian classical, Middle Eastern music, hip hop, electronica, and Brazilian music, including bossa nova.\n\n\n== History ==\nThievery Corporation was formed in the summer of 1995 at Washington D.C.'s Eighteenth Street Lounge. Rob Garza and Lounge co-owner Eric Hilton were drawn together over their mutual love of club life, as well as dub, bossa nova and jazz records. They decided to see what would come of mixing all these in a recording studio, and from this, in 1996 the duo started their Eighteenth Street Lounge Music record label.\nThe duo drew attention with their first two 12-inch offerings, \"Shaolin Satellite\" and \"2001: a Spliff Odyssey\", and with their 1996 debut LP, Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi.\nIn 2001, they released Sounds From The Verve Hi-Fi, a \"best of\" compilation of 1960s–1970s material of Verve Records that includes Jazz, Bossa Nova and Latin Jazz works from artists like Cal Tjader, Wes Montgomery, Sérgio Mendes & Brasil '66, Luiz Bonfá, among others. \nIn 2002 they released The Richest Man in Babylon on their ESL label. This fifteen-track album is similar in sound and timbre to their earlier 2000 release, The Mirror Conspiracy, and features performances by vocalists Emilíana Torrini, Pam Bricker, and Loulou. \nIn 2004, they released The Cosmic Game, which has a darker, more psychedelic sound than The Richest Man in Babylon. The album also featured more high-profile guest singers on it, including Perry Farrell, David Byrne, and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips.\nIn 2006, the group released Versions, a selection of remixes by Thievery Corporation for other artists. They toured around the United States, playing at Lollapalooza. The tour was photographed by Rob Myers, Thievery Corporation's sitar and guitar player, in the Blurb photo book Thievery Corporation 2006. In 2006, the band also recorded \"Sol Tapado\" for the AIDS benefit album Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin Redux produced by the Red Hot Organization. As well, in the 2006 release of Tiger Woods PGA Tour for Xbox, their music was featured as the soundtrack to the game. Also in 2006, Puma Ptah, then known as Ras Puma, joined and toured with Thievery Corporation and continues to tour with them today.\nThe group released their fifth studio album, Radio Retaliation, on September 23, 2008. It was nominated for the Grammy for best recording package. Thievery Corporation's tour started out with five consecutive sold-out shows at the 9:30 Club in Washington, DC.\nThey were the opening act on August 1, 2009, for Paul McCartney at FedExField in Landover, Maryland.\nOn July 27, 2010, Babylon Central, the cinematic directorial debut of founding member Eric Hilton, was released. Set (and shot) in Washington, D.C., the film follows tripwire events in the interconnected lives of its characters, each influencing power brokers' schemes to manipulate international currencies.\nIn June 2011, Thievery Corporation released their sixth album, Culture of Fear, which also featured the vocal stylings of Puma Ptah, then known as Ras Puma, on the tracks: \"Overstand\" and \"False Flag Dub.\"\nIn January 2012, Thievery Corporation launched a remixes contest in conjunction with Dubspot. The same year, Eric Hilton from Thievery Corporation produced the debut album, Archives, for Washington D.C. based reggae band \"The Archives.\" \nThe band released Saudade on March 25, 2014, via ESL Music.\nOn January 11, 2017, the band released the song \"Ghetto Matrix\" from their album The Temple of I & I, which was released on February 10, 2017, again via their own ESL Music label.\nOn April 20, 2018, the band released Treasures from the Temple via ESL Music.\nThroughout their career, the duo has repeatedly expressed their fondness for Brazilian culture in interviews and liner notes of their releases, especially of the 1960s Bossa Nova music movement. Some of their earlier recordings were accompanied by artwork paying specific homage to classic releases by bossa nova artists like João Gilberto (his self-titled 1973 album) or Tom Jobim (Stone Flower). Their 1997 debut album is also dedicated to the memory of Brazilian musician Antonio Carlos Jobim, who died three years earlier.\nThe language of the group's lyrics throughout their career include English, Spanish, French, Italian, Persian, Portuguese, Romanian and Hindi. This reflects the group's world music influences.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThievery Corporation has taken liberal political stances on various issues, opposing war and what they regard as exploitative trade agreements, while supporting human rights and food programs.\nIn September 2005, the group participated in the Operation Ceasefire concert, with the objective of ending the Iraq War.\nFrom their press release regarding their album Radio Retaliation, Garza said:\n\nRadio Retaliation is definitely a more overt political statement [...] There's no excuse for not speaking out at this point, with the suspension of habeas corpus, outsourced torture, illegal wars of aggression, fuel, food, and economic crises. It's hard to close your eyes and sleep while the world is burning around you. If you are an artist, this is the most essential time to speak up.\nThievery Corporation are vocal advocates for the World Food Programme, seeing hunger as \"...something basic, really elemental, that transcends boundaries around the world.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nFull members\n\nRob Garza – bass, guitar, keyboards, production\nEric Hilton – bass, guitar, keyboards, production\nTouring and studio musicians\n\nJeff Franca – drums\nRob Myers – sitar, guitar\nFrank Orrall – percussion, drums, vocals\nAshish \"Hash\" Vyas – bass\nTouring and studio vocalists\n\nNatalia Clavier\nLoulou Ghelichkhani\nShana Halligan\nRacquel Jones\nMr. Lif\nNotch\nPuma\nSEE-I\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nAbductions and Reconstructions (1999)\nRare Tracks: 18th Street Lounge (1999)\nDJ-Kicks: Thievery Corporation (1999)\nThievery Corporation and Revolution Present: Departures (2000)\nSounds from the Verve Hi-Fi (2001)\nThe Outernational Sound (2004)\nVersions (2006)\nRed Hot + Latin: Silencio = Muerte Redux (2006)\nIt Takes a Thief (2010)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nSingles released on ESL Music, unless noted.\n\n\n=== Eric Hilton albums ===\nPeace Bureau Inner City Booms LP (2017)\nInfinite Everywhere (2020)\nThe Impossible Silence (2020)\nCeremony (2021)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nEighteenth Street Lounge Music"

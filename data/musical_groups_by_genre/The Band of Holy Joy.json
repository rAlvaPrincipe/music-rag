    "text": "The Band of Holy Joy are an English band formed in New Cross, London, and initially active between 1984 and 1993, releasing several albums. In 1992, they abbreviated their name to Holy Joy. They reformed in 2002, under their original name, releasing a new album called Love Never Fails. They concentrated on other musical projects during 2003 to 2006. The band began performing live again in 2007 and since 2017 have released a number of albums on Tiny Global Productions, including Funambulist We Love You, Neon Primitives, Dreams Take Flight, and their latest critically acclaimed release Fated Beautiful Mistakes in 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 1984, by Johny Brown in New Cross, South London. Early experiments revolved around cheap junk shop instrumentation and rudimentary electronics. After two self-issued cassettes, they signed to South London indie label Flim Flam for a string of singles and two 1987 albums; More Tales From The City and the live LP When Stars Come Out To Play.\nThe band reached a commercial and critical peak after signing to Rough Trade, with Manic, Magic, Majestic in 1989, and Positively Spooked in 1990, supported by a tour of the U.S.S.R. The label was forced into receivership in 1991 following cash flow problems and eventual bankruptcy. The band re-emerged in 1992 as Holy Joy, with the album Tracksuit Vendetta. They split up in 1993 and Brown moved into freelance journalism, playwriting and production.\nBand of Holy Joy reformed in 2002 and released an album Love Never Fails. After a number of live dates the band became inactive between 2003, and 2006, pursuing other musical projects. In May 2007, the band began playing live again. October 2007 saw the release of Leaves That Fall in Spring, a best of released on the Cherry Red label.\nIn 2008, after playing nine warm-up dates in and around London during April, May and June, the band set off to the US for the first time in their 24-year history and embarked on a successful tour of New York City. Punklore, a six-track CD was released and initially only available at the New York gigs.\nIn 2009, the band started to explore theatrical and multimedia based performances. As their alter ego Radio Joy, they performed two song plays Troubled Sleep and  Invocation to William. Troubled Sleep was a fictional account of Sid and Nancy's last days at the Chelsea Hotel in New York. It played out over several nights in the Shunt Theatre Lounge in London and Star and Shadow Cinema in Newcastle. Invocation to William was performed at The University of London Institute in Paris at the event celebrating the 50th anniversary of William S. Burroughs' Naked Lunch, 'Lunch @ 50'. The songs from this show were released as a mini album CD A Lucky Thief in a Careless World on the band's own Radio Joy label. In October 2009, they were invited to play The Wire magazine's 'Into the Vortex' festival, followed by a series of shows in Athens, Greece, later that year.\nParamour, the band's eleventh album was released on 8 June 2010 and featured eight songs that had evolved from the song play Troubled Sleep.\nIn 2011, the band embarked on another tour of Greece, playing in the cities of Athens, Thessaloniki, and Larissa. They made their first appearance at Glastonbury Festival and performed their third song play Beuys Will Be Beuys in London and Thessaloniki. A CD release titled How To Kill A Butterfly was released on 28 October 2011 on Exotic Pylon Records.\nOn 15 March 2012, a CD release entitled The North Is Another Land was released on German independent record label Moloko Plus.\nOn 28 January 2013, a double cassette and digital download titled City of Tales: Volume 1 & 2 was released on Exotic Pylon Records. Volume 1 contains previously unreleased material from 1985 found by former band member Brett Turnbull, restored and accompanied by a second volume of recordings from 2012. This was followed up in 2014 with Easy Listening which was released on Exotic Pylon Records with an accompanying UK tour.\nTheir album The Land of Holy Joy was released through Stereogram Recordings on 21 September 2015.\nSince 2017, the band have put out a series of releases on label Tiny Global Productions starting with an EP on 10\" vinyl entitled Brutalism Begins at Home followed by the albums, Funambulist We Love You, Neon Primitives, Dreams Take Flight and Fated Beautiful Mistakes in 2023 which Louder Than War described as \"an album that everyone should hear and hopefully take to their heart. Songs that make you feel less alone. More optimistic and free to grasp hope and love where and when you can, while you can\". A new album Scorched Jerusalem is due for release on 17 January 2025.\nBand of Holy Joy host their own radio show, Bad Punk, on Resonance FM every Friday from 10pm until 11pm.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe band's music includes elements of post-punk, folk rock, European cabaret, reflective instrumentation and epic pop, with Jacques Brel, Bertolt Brecht, Coleridge and David Peace identified as influences. Their City of Tales release has been likened to David Bowie's 1. Outside and the work of Pere Ubu. Jason Ankeny, writing for Allmusic, described the band as \"urban folk\". Rob Young, in the book Rough Trade, described their music as \"a bohemian mix of inner city guignol, Brechtian street song, and soaring romanticism\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\nChart placings are from the UK Independent Chart.\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nFavourite Fairytales For Juvenile Delinquents  (1983) self released (cassette)\nMore Favourite Fairytales (1984) Pleasantly Surprised (cassette)\nInto The City of Tales (1985) (cassette) (Unreleased)\nThe Big Ship Sails (1986) Flim Flam (10-inch mini-LP)\nMore Tales From The City (1987) Flim Flam - no. 8\nWhen Stars Come Out To Play (1987) Flim Flam\nThe Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (1988) (cassette) Cause For Concern\nManic, Magic, Majestic (1989) Rough Trade - no. 7\nPositively Spooked (1990) Rough Trade\nTracksuit Vendetta (1992) Ecuador\nLove Never Fails (2002) Rough Trade\nLeaves That Fall in Spring - Seminal Moments (2007) Cherry Red\nPunklore (2008) 6 track CD available during US tour\nParamour (2010) Radio Joy\nHow To Kill A Butterfly (2011) Exotic Pylon\nThe North is Another Land (2012) Moloko Plus\nCity of Tales: Volume 1 & 2 (2013) Exotic Pylon (Limited double cassette and digital download)\nEasy Listening (2014) Exotic Pylon\nThe Land of Holy Joy (2015) Stereogram Recordings\nThe Clouds that Break the Sky (2017) - compilation of recordings for Flim Flam\nFunambulist We Love You (2017) Tiny Global Productions\nNeon Primitives (2019) Tiny Global Productions\nDreams Take Flight (2021) Tiny Global Productions\nEveryone Is Searching For Beautiful Things (2021) Tiny Global Productions\nFated Beautiful Mistakes (2023) Tiny Global Productions\nScorched Jerusalem (2025) Tiny Global Productions\n\n\n=== Singles/EPs ===\nHad a Mother Who Was Proud (1985) Flim Flam (12-inch EP)\nWho Snatched The Baby?

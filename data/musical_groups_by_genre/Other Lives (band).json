    "text": "Other Lives is an American indie rock band from Stillwater, Oklahoma, United States.\nThe band originally formed in 2004 as Kunek and released one album in 2006 under that name. Other Lives' self-titled album was released physically April 7, 2009 by TBD Records and digitally March 17, 2009. The album was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Joey Waronker.\nAccording to their official Facebook page current band members are Jesse Tabish (piano, guitar, lead vocals), Jonathon Mooney (piano, guitar, percussion, trumpet) & Josh Onstott (bass, keys, percussion, guitar, backing vocals)\n\"For 12\" was featured as KCRW's \"Today's Top Tune\" on October 27, 2010.\nOther Lives finished working on their album Tamer Animals in February 2011. The album was released on May 10, 2011, in the USA and August 29, 2011, in UK/Europe.\nIn the summer of 2011, the band toured with S. Carey and The Rosebuds. Following a month of shows in the UK, the band joined Bon Iver in September in the USA and Canada and played at Iceland Airwaves festival. The band returned to the UK in October to support Chapel Club in London on October 18.  \nIn September 2011, Other Lives launched their Wirewax interactive website, which was built around the band's official video for \"For 12\", and allowed users to access audio and visual content within the video.\nOn October 22, 2012, Other Lives' new album, Mind the Gap EP, was released.\nIn 2012, the band took a hiatus from performing to work on their upcoming album, \"Rituals.\" Over the next few years, Other Lives released the eponymous \"Rituals\" and \"2 Pyramids\" as promotional singles before releasing the album on May 4, 2015. \"Rituals\" marked a departure from TBD Records, as the band instead released their newest album on the Belgian label Play It Again Sam Recordings with the help of co-producer and Atoms For Peace drummer Joey Waronker. In a message about the album on their website, front man Jesse Tabish wrote, \"We wanted a cleaner, brighter record with more movement and color.\" During the eighteen month period of the album's creation, the group wrote over sixty songs before releasing its current, fourteen track iteration, which runs at fifty-four minutes and eighteen seconds. The album has a notably more somber feel to it than previous works, with AllMusic describing its sound as \"shimmery, meticulously crafted . . . pure pop bliss . . . rooted in darkness.\"\nIn the summer of 2014, Shearwater drummer Danny Reisch replaced Colby Owens.\nThe band spent the summer of 2018 recording a new album in Cooper Mountain, Oregon.  On January 9, 2020, they announced that the album For Their Love will be released on April 24, 2020.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nFor 12 (12\" vinyl with 2 bonus tracks) (2011)\nFor 12 (2 track - UK promo single with edit version) (2011)\nTamer Animals (2 track - promo single with edit version) (2011)\nOld Statues (2 track - UK promo single with edit version) (2011)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOther Lives official website\nOther Lives at AllMusic\nOther Lives full hour concert in France at Liveweb.Arte.TV"

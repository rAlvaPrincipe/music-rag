    "text": "Brainbombs is a Swedish garage punk band formed 1985 in Hudiksvall. The members are Dan, Peter, Jonas, Drajan, Mattis and Lanchy. The latter was also a member of Totalitär. Prior to Brainbombs, Peter was in a band called Dödshjälp fd. Hedebyborna. \nThey are notable for their very repetitive, noisy, untuned, raucous sound. Their lyrical themes and concept have been very controversial, as some of the songs depict acts of rape, torture, and murder, similar to the writings of author Peter Sotos, who has been named as an influence for the group. Other artists named as influences for the band include Chrome, James Chance, and Whitehouse, and the group's name comes from a Punishment of Luxury song.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent\n\nPeter Råberg – vocals\nJonas Tiljander – guitar\nDrajan Bryngelsson – drums\nDan Råberg – trumpet\nLanchy Orre – guitar\nMattis Rundgren – bass\n\n\n=== Former ===\nAndreas Lönnquist – bass (1985)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBurning Hell (1992)\nGenius and Brutality...

Leroy Davis is credited with establishing Southern University's marching band and served as the band director between 1947 and 1964.

Dr. Isaac Greggs (Doc) was an award-winning band director and alumnus of Southern University that led the band for 36 years (1969 - 2005).  Under his leadership, the band grew in popularity and established a distinctive identity.

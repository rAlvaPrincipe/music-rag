    "text": "N-Train (Korean: 엔트레인) was a South Korean boy band, signed under MediaLine Entertainment. The group consisted of five members: Jungkyun, Seunghyun, Soul J, Yujin and Sangwoo.\n\n\n== History ==\nPrior to debut, N-Train trained with their agency for three years. In hopes to break the idol group image of recording dance-type music, MediaLine Entertainment directed their attention in recording R&B and soul-oriented music instead.\nN-Train debuted with a mid-tempo ballad song, \"울면서 울어 (One Last Cry)\", on May 27, 2011. In one of their music reviews, a staff writer from Allkpop complimented their debut single, noting that \"N-Train will find most of their appeal is surprisingly through their singing, because boy is it good.\" The writer compared Jung Jung Kyun vocal ability to TVXQ's Max.\n\n\n== Members ==\nSeunghyun (승현)\nJungkyun (정균)\nSoul J\nYujin (유진)\nSangwoo (상우)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

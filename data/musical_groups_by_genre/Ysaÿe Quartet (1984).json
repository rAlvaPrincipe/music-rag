It ended its existence in January 2014.\nIts members as of the time they disbanded were:\n\nGuillaume Sutre (violin) (previously Christophe Giovaninetti)\nLuc-Marie Aguera (violin) (previously Romano Tommasini)\nMiguel da Silva (viola)\nYovan Markovitch (cello) (previously Carlos Dourthe, then Michel Poulet, then Marc Coppey, then François Salque)\nThe ensemble undertook studies with members of the Amadeus Quartet in Cologne from 1986 to 1989. It won prizes at competitions in Trapani (2nd), Portsmouth (2nd) and Evian (1st). The quartet won admiration for its recordings of the quartets of Debussy and Ravel, and, with pianist Pascal Rogé, of the quintets of Fauré. They also performed a set of Mozart's \"Haydn\" Quartets for the Decca label to much acclaim. They taught at CNR in Paris and gave masterclasses in the mountain city of Flaine in France. \n\n\n== External links ==\nManager's web page\n(in French)Official web site"

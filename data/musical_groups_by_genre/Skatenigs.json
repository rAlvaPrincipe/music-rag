    "text": "The Skatenigs are a punk industrial metal band from Texas which formed in the late 1980s.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Skatenigs' lead singer, Phil \"Phildo\" Owen, previously performed on the album Beers, Steers, and Queers by the Revolting Cocks and performed with the band on tour from 1989 to 1991. They released the single \"Chemical Imbalance\" in 1991 on Wax Trax! Records. Its B-side was a cover of the Big Boys song \"Big Picture.\" Their debut album, Stupid People Shouldn't Breed, was released on Megaforce Records in 1992. It was produced by Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen, making the Skatenigs the first Texas band to attract Ministry's attention. Also in 1992, Owen produced Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame, the debut album by fellow Texans from Corpus Christi Skrew. Owen formed Choreboy along with Chris Gates of the Big Boys.\nIn 2011, Phil Owen reformed the band, but this time recruiting Mike Scaccia of Ministry and Casey Orr of GWAR. The band would play a few outings that year and the following year. But it wasn't until 2016 when the band self-released Adult Entertainment For Kids that Owen would reform once again, this time with the current lineup of Myke Bingham, Adam Lamar, and Chris Gates, with production cohort Chris Ahrens.\nIn 2020, the band released two albums compiling previously released material, as Show Me Where They Touched You and Show Me Where They Touched You... Again.\nDuring 2020, the current lineup took advantage of shutdowns to produce a new album, What Could Go Wrong?, which was released by Cleopatra Records and Armalyte Industries on November 5, 2021.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nPhil Owen\nChris Ahrens\nMyke Bingham\n\n\n=== Past ===\nRon Brietzke - Bass (9 string)\nChristopher Chambers - Guitar/programming\nJason \"Megabyte\" Cobb - Keyboards\n\"Keefy Weefy\" Dailey - Drums\nMark Dufour - Drums/programming\nMike Dunn - Drums\nRalph Ekakiadis - Keyboards\nChip Fischer - Drums\nChris Gates - Bass\nBilly Jackson - Guitar\nMat Mitchell - Guitar/programming\nDon G. \"DonG\" Meyer - Mascot\nJack Lightfoot - Bass\nGreg Main - Drums\nJohn Monte - Bass\nWendy Nelson - Keyboards\nPhil \"Phildo\" Owen - Insults, vocals, production and advertising\nLance Von Moulder - Bass\nSteve \"Bunghole\" Schubert - Guitar (unplugged)\nClayton Wavering - Guitar\nJason Wolford - Turntables/programming\nBold font = original line-up\n\n\n=== Guest appearances and cameos ===\nAl Jourgensen\nJeff Ward\nGibby Haynes\nLee Ving\nMarstan Daly\nCharles Levi\nPaul Raven\nSatanâ€™s cheerleaders\nAdditional studio help roster:\n\nJeff \"Dawg\" Allen\nKing George\nJoe Kelly\nLeslie Stewart\nRosemary Walker\nJacy Planta\nFluffy\nJody and Jill\nCaroline Schwartz\nSteve Shaw\nPalmer Earley\nWax Trax staff\nTrax studio staff\nDigital Services staff\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStupid People Shouldn't Breed (Megaforce, 1992)\nWhat a Mangled Web We Leave (Red Light Records, 1994)\nAdult Entertainment For Kids (Self-released, 2016)\nShow Me Where They Touched You (Self-released, 2020)\nShow Me Where They Touched You...

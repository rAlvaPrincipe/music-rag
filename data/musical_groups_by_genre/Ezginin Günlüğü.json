    "text": "Ezginin Günlüğü (Melody's Diary in Turkish) is a Turkish band formed in 1982 in Istanbul by Emin İgüs, Hakan Yılmaz, Şebnem Başar, Tugay Başar, and Vedat Verter. Shortly after its foundation, three new members joined the band: Nadir Göktürk, Tanju Duru, and Cüneyt Duru.  They made their first concert in 1983.  Their first album, Seni Düşünmek (To think of You), was released in 1985. \nThe original group dissolved itself in 1990, following personal disagreements on the kind of music different members wanted to make.  However, Nadir Göktürk, without the approval of the other group members, brought in new members and continued to perform under the same name.  Hüsnü Arkan and Fatih Saçlı have joined the band and the first album involving them, İstavrit, was released in 1993. The popularity of the band increased dramatically after the album Oyun released in 1995.\nEzginin Günlüğü is noted for their musical diversity and vocal harmonies. One of the strongest connections to their listeners is their use of the lyrics. In the 80s they were using well-known poems and singing songs with political allusions. In the 90s they were still using poems but they also started to write their own lyrics. Their music is based on Anatolian folk music, with a contemporary interpretation.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSeni Düşünmek  (\"To Think of You,\" 1985)\nSabah Türküsü (\"Morning Ballad,\" 1986)\nAlagözlü Yar (\"Hazel-eyed Love,\" 1987)\nBahçedeki Sandal (\"The Boat in the Garden,\" 1988)\nÖlüdeniz (\"Dead Sea,\" 1990)\nİstavrit (\"Horse Mackerel,\" 1993)\nOyun (\"Game,\" 1995)\nEbruli (\"Variegated,\" 1996)\nHürriyete Doğru (\"Through to Freedom,\" 1997)\nAşk Yüzünden (\"Because of Love,\" 1998)\nRüya (\"Dream,\" 2000)\nHer Şey Yolunda (\"Everything's Alright,\" 2002)\nİlk Aşk (\"First Love,\" 2003)\nDargın mıyız (\"Are We Peeved,\" 2005)\nÇeyrek (\"Quarter,\" 2007) (Tribute album.

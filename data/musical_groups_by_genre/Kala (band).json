    "text": "Kala (stylized in all caps) is a Filipino band that blends funk, nu-disco, acid jazz, electronic and rock music. Its members are Brian Tanchanco, JP Tanchanco, Jade Justine, and Andrew Contreras.\n\n\n== History ==\nKALA's first full-length album came on the music scene in 2005 with their debut album under Sony BMG entitled Manila High. The group is most noted for its hit single “Jeepney” and is credited with the  resurgence of a distinct and defining genre of Filipino music known as “Manila sound”. The name “Kala” originates from the original members’ college cake-making venture called the “Kala Cake Project”.\n\nIn 2008, KALA underwent a self-imposed hiatus following the departures of bassist Lyle Pasco, lead guitarist JP Tanchanco and lead vocalist Mike Grape from the band.\nIn 2011, KALA resurfaced with new members Jade Justine and Voopee Elviña.\nFollowing their come back, KALA performed in Jack Daniel's third Philippine tour entitled “Jack Daniel’s On Stage: Scouting Gigs” on November 22, 2013.\nLead guitarist Voopee Elviña died on December 4, 2015, after a battle with nasopharyngeal cancer.\n\n\n=== KALAMAN ===\nDuring a summer vacation in Boracay last 2004, some of the old band members had a picture posing in silhouette against the sunset. Various poses were made which represented each of the band members. Brian decided to combine prominent elements of each pose in order to blend it in one unifying image. This became the official logo of KALA. It represents convergence and harmony with the sharing of friendship, talents and passion from each of the band members.\n\n\n== Advocacy ==\nIn 2004, KALA started performing for Rock Ed Philippines, a nationwide volunteer group that offers alternative education to underprivileged Filipino youth through art, music, poetry, and the like. In the same year, the band released an EP entitled “RockEdition: For the Benefit of the Filipino Youth” by way of support for the UN's “Millennium Development Goals” and “Global Call to Action Against Poverty.”\nIn 2011, KALA performed for Rock Ed once again in their “Rock the Riles: Rocking for Education” tour.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\n\nBrian Tanchanco: lead vocals, keytar, keyboards, synths (2004-2008; 2010–present)\nJP Tanchanco: lead guitar (2004-2008; 2015–present)\nJade Justine: bass guitar (2010–present)\nAndrew Contreras: drums (2015–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nVoopee Elviña: lead guitar, backup vocals (2010–2015, deceased)\nRaymond Daylo: drums, backup vocals (2004-2008; 2010–2015)\nLyle Pasco: bass guitar (2005-2008)\nWilliam Gabaldon: bass guitar (2004-2005)\nMike Grape: lead vocals (2004-2008; 2010-2012, deceased)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Future Disco (2013) ===\nTouch Me Kiss Me\nElla Villamor\nDr. Strange\nTipar\nImaginary Lucy\nFuture Disco\nLibot\nThe Race\nPag Ikot\nFeel My Love\n\n\n=== Manila High (2005) ===\nPulis Pangkalawakan\nParapap\nJeepney\nSync of 8\nSouth Side\nPiso Pisong Paraiso\nManila High\nSalamin\nBakbakan Na\nTubero\nWeather Forecast\nJeepney (Nude Mix)\n\n\n=== RockEdition: For the Benefit of the Filipino Youth (2004) ===\nPulis Pangkalawakan\nPira Pirasong Paraiso\nSouthside\nSalamin\nBakbakan Na\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\nThe Best of Manila Sound: Hopia Mani Popcorn (Viva Records, 2006)\nEnvironmentally Sound: A Select Anthology of Songs Inspired by the Earth (World Wide Fund for Nature, 2006)\nPinoy Soul Movement (Warner Music Philippines, 2007)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

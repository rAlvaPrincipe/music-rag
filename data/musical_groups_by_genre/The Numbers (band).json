    "text": "The Numbers were an Australian power pop band formed by siblings Annalisse (bass guitar, lead vocals) and Chris Morrow (lead guitar, lead vocals) in early 1978. They issued two studio albums, The Numbers (October 1980), which peaked at No. 29 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart, and 39.51 (April 1982). The group disbanded in 1984, the Morrows formed another band, Maybe Dolls, in 1991.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Numbers were formed early in 1978 in Sydney by Annalisse Morrow on bass guitar and lead vocals and her elder brother, Chris Morrow on lead guitar and lead vocals; they were joined by Marty Newcombe on drums. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, observed that they \"emerged from the post-punk Sydney scene with a clean sound and a strong sense of direction. In spite of a regular touring schedule and a brace of accessible pop releases, the band never made the commercial breakthrough for which they so vigorously strived.\"\nIn January 1979 Newcombe was replaced on drums and percussion by Simon Vidale. The group supported the Australian leg of a tour by United Kingdom rockers, XTC. The Numbers released their debut three-track, extended play, Govt. Boy, on the Local Records label in September. All the tracks were written or co-written by Chris. McFarlane felt that it \"featured three dazzling blasts of tough guitar pop reminiscent of The Jam or The Buzzcocks.\"\nLate in 1979 the group signed with Deluxe Records, which issued their debut single, \"The Modern Song\", in the following March. The second single, \"Five Letter Word\", reached the Kent Music Report Singles Chart top 40. A third single, \"Mr President\" (February 1981) failed to chart. Their debut album, The Numbers, appeared in October 1980, which reached No. 29 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. It was produced by Cameron Allan and was recorded at EMI Studios 301, Sydney in mid-year.\n\n\n== Members ==\nGraham `Buzz' Bidstrup\nJohn Bliss\nCraig Bloxom\nRussell Handley\nAnnalisse Morrow\nChris Morrow\nMarty Newcombe\nColin Newham\nMarcus Phelan\nGary Roberts\nSimon Vidale\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== TV Week / Countdown Awards ===\nCountdown was an Australian pop music TV series on national broadcaster ABC-TV from 1974–1987, it presented music awards from 1979–1987, initially in conjunction with magazine TV Week.

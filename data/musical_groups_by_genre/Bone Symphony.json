    "text": "Bone Symphony was a short-lived synthpop / new wave active in the early 1980s. The group consisted of Scott Wilk on lead vocals and synthesizer, Marc Levinthal (guitar, bass synthesizer and sequencer, drum machine, 808 programming) and keyboard artist Jacob Magnusson. All band members played synthesizer keyboards. They were signed to Capitol Records and released only one record, Bone Symphony EP, in 1983.\nThey are most famous for their song \"One Foot in Front of the Other\" which appeared in the films Revenge of the Nerds and Ted 2, an episode of Family Guy, Good Girls and New Girl.\n\n\n== Comparisons ==\n\"L.A.-based Bone Symphony takes a more conventional approach, landing somewhere between Orchestral Manoeuvers In The Dark and Real Life, and almost directly on top of Heaven 17.\" \"The name Bone Symphony is intended to 'combine visceral aspects with intellectual ones,' and musically, that's what they succeed in doing about half the time...\".\n\n\n== Outside projects ==\nOutside of Bone Symphony, Wilk found a career as a composer for film and television, spanning three decades. Beginning in 1982, for an episode of CBS Afternoon Playhouse. He and Levinthal also wrote the score for the film Valley Girl, which featured Nicolas Cage in his first starring role.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nScott Wilk – lead vocals, synthesizer\nMarc Levinthal – guitar, bass synthesizer and sequencer, drum machine, Roland TR-808\nJacob Magnusson – keyboard\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBone Symphony EP (1983)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\nSoundtrack appearances\nRevenge of the Nerds – \"One Foot In Front of the Other\"\nFamily Guy (Don't Make Me Over) – \"One Foot In Front of the Other\"\nTed 2 – \"One Foot In Front of the Other\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBone Symphony discography at Discogs"

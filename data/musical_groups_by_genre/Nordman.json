    "text": "Nordman is a Swedish duo founded in 1993, that mixes folk music with rock and pop. This genre is called etnorock or folk rock in Swedish. The group consists of Håkan Hemlin, as singer and frontman, and Mats Wester, who plays the nyckelharpa, as well as serving as the main songwriter.\nThe group's biggest hits were \"Förlist\" (Shipwrecked) and \"Vandraren\" (The Wanderer). The group split up in 1998 because of the lead singer's drug problem, but reunited in 2004. They made a comeback in the Swedish Melodifestivalen with the song \"Ödet var min väg\" (Fate was my way) and released a comeback album called Anno 2005 in 2005. In 2008, they competed once again in Melodifestivalen with the song \"I lågornas sken\" and finished in sixth place behind winner Charlotte Perrelli. Nordman's song \"Vandraren\" was covered by Blackmore's Night on their 2010 album Autumn Sky and by Ensiferum on their 2009 album From Afar.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1991–1993 ===\nHemlin and Wester met in a studio in Hjorthagen in 1991. Hemlin was there with his rock band Bye Bye to record a demo to a promo-CD. Wester had for some years been experimenting with blending folk and pop and searched for a vocalist to the project. He asked Hemlin if he was interested to try some, and he was. Experiments began after a few hits came the embryo of what would become the song \"Förlist\" (wrecked). Gradually added another demos and autumn of 1993 it was time to check if any record company wanted to do an album with the new, completely unknown group Nordman.\n\n\n=== 1994 ===\nSonet Records showed interest and signed Nordman. Then work began on the first album. In February 1994, released first single \"Förlist\" (wrecked). The album was released in late April of that year. Already after four weeks, the album was recorded for gold record (at that time was 50 000 copies). The second single \"The Wanderer\" went straight to Sommartoppen's first place, and remained there all summer. During the summer, the album also crossed the border for platinum (100 000 copies). Nordman toured in Sweden, more or less nonstop for a year. Two singles were released from the album, \"Laglöst land\" (Lawless Land) and \"Ännu glöder solen\" (The sun still glows) The latter peaked at number one on the Swedish Singles Chart in 1995.\n\n\n=== 1995–1996 ===\nJust one year after their debut album, on 22 November 1995, the band released their second album, Ingenmansland (No Man's Land).

    "text": "Ya Tosiba started out as an electronic music duo formed in Finland in 2010, consisting of Norwegian-Azerbaijani singer and producer Zuzu Zakaria and Finnish electronic music producer Tatu Metsätähti (also known as Mesak). Zuzu continues the project as a solo artist.\nTheir music is a blend of Scandinavian electronic music, Hip hop and classical Arabic, Persian and Turkic music traditions such as Mugam and Ashik.\nThe texts and poetry used are historical and belong to a genre known as Meykhana. Those were found by Zuzu Zakaria at field-trips to Azerbaijan as a part of her MA Thesis for State University in Oslo. Her master's thesis is the only introductory study in English of the genre existing.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n2017 Love Party (Asphalt Tango Records)\n2023 ASAP in​ş​allah (Huge Bass)\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\n2012 Mouse on Mars: Parastrophics (Monkey Town), track 12: Baku Hipster\n2012 Center Of The Universe: Astral Harassment (Metronomicon Audio), track 1: Streelight Interference\n2015 Joxaren: Diir Balek (European Music), track B1: Qurban Gəlir\n2017 Pykäri: Pykäri (Solina Records), track 09: Anlatamıyorum\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n2016 Racing Heart: What Comes After (Ya Tosiba Remix)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n2013 Skweee!

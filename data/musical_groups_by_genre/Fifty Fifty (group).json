    "text": "Fifty Fifty (Korean: 피프티 피프티; RR: Pipeuti Pipeuti; stylized in all caps) is a South Korean girl group formed by Attrakt in 2022. The group consists of five members: Keena, Chanelle, Yewon, Hana, and Athena. Originally a four-piece ensemble, Saena, Aran, and Sio left in 2023 following the termination of their contracts.\nFifty Fifty debuted on November 18, 2022, with their extended play (EP) The Fifty. They experienced a commercial breakthrough with their viral hit single \"Cupid\". The single, which was released in  February 2023, made Fifty Fifty the fastest K-pop group to enter the US Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart, within four months of debut. Furthermore, it made them the first K-pop girl group to enter the top ten of the UK charts.\nLater that year, amidst a series of legal disputes and allegations surrounding the group's contracts and treatment by Attrakt, group members Saena, Aran, and Sio had their contracts terminated, leaving Keena as the only remaining member in the label. It was subsequently decided that Fifty Fifty would re-debut in September 2024, with Keena and four new members added to the group.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe group's name, Fifty Fifty, indicates the coexistence, in equal parts, of a hope-filled ideal and a harsh reality, as well as their hope to become a whole 100 with their fans.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut ===\nIn 2019, Attrakt CEO Jeon Hong-joon and the CEO of performance production company KAMP met in Singapore during a festival and decided to work together to produce a global K-pop girl group, with KAMP in charge of the overseas marketing. The two companies were joined by one of KAMP employees and producer, Ahn Sung-il (Siahn). Twelve trainees were recruited by Jeon for a year starting in December 2019 and were finally reduced to four through monthly evaluations.\nIn January 2021, KAMP left the project due to differing views over the global strategy. The following May, Ahn and two other KAMP employees who had been involved in the project resigned and established The Givers: while Jeon was in charge of raising money, Ahn chose the music direction and trained the members in music theory, singing, dancing, rapping, acting and English. More than ₩20–30 million a month were spent on the group, and more than a billion was invested in the production of four music videos.\nPrior to the group's debut, Saena participated as a contestant on KBS' dancing competition show Dancing High.\n\n\n=== 2022: Introduction and debut with The Fifty ===\n\nAfter two years of training, on November 14, 2022, Fifty Fifty announced that they would be debuting in November 2022 by releasing the group's official logo image posted across all the group's social media accounts. The same day, a pre-released music video for the song \"Lovin Me\" was released on their official YouTube channel. The members were revealed on November 15 through the concept photo of their debut album, which revealed the names and the debut date, and official photos of the members for the first time. A performance video of \"Log In\" was also released the same day.\nFifty Fifty released their debut extended play (EP) The Fifty on November 18, 2022, with \"Higher\" serving as the lead single. The album contains the first journey of girls who yearn for freedom beyond the chaos of reality and eventually move on to a utopia. It consists of four tracks – \"Higher\", which has an R&B pop feeling that sings about the world of ecstasy and dreams, \"Tell Me\", a city pop song, \"Lovin Me\", which conveys a message of comfort to young people who are going through growing pains, and \"Log In\", which expresses the movements of girls who rebel to escape from the suffocating real world with intense performances. Promotions for the extended play's release began on November 22 with their music broadcast debut on SBS M's The Show and ended on KBS2's Music Bank on December 2. The EP did not enter the Circle Album Chart when it was first released, but it debuted at number forty-four on the chart issue dated December 18–24, 2022, with 2,597 album sales. Korean critic magazine IZM rated the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, the highest rating the magazine has ever given to a girl group. The writer, Son Seung-geun, opined that Fifty Fifty \"is a good example of what happens when great songs and good singers meet. Thanks to them, Korea has one more good girl group.\"\nFifty Fifty was selected as one of The Recording Academy's \"K-pop Girl Groups To Watch in 2023\", writing, \"the quartet displays various colors and a vocal maturity that is both hard to find and crucial to have.\" They were also named one of the \"Best K-pop Debuts of the Year\" by Rolling Stone India, and \"Tell Me\" and \"Lovin' Me\" were featured on the lists of the \"Best K-pop Songs of 2022\" compiled by Paper and Mashable, respectively.\n\n\n=== 2023: International success with \"Cupid\" and legal dispute with Attrakt ===\n\nOn February 24, 2023, the group released its first single album, The Beginning: Cupid, along with the music video for title track \"Cupid\". The song, which was recorded both in Korean and English, saw Keena writing part of the Korean lyrics. Soon after, a fan-made sped-up rendition of the English version went viral on TikTok. \"Cupid\" consequently entered the Billboard Hot 100 on March 27, making them the sixth group and the fastest K-pop group in history to do so. The song went on to become the highest-charting hit by a South Korean girl group in the history of the Pop Airplay chart, and the second South Korean music act to land on the Adult Pop Airplay after BTS. In April 2023, Fifty Fifty formed a partnership with Warner Music Korea.\nOn June 19, the members of the group filed for an injunction to suspend their exclusive contracts with Attrakt, citing the violation of contractual obligations, as well as the lack of transparency in financial settlements, and medical negligence, during the group's promotions. They also filed for trademarks of the group's name and their stage names. The news of the injunction was belatedly revealed to the public after Attrakt accused Warner Music Korea and Ahn Sung-il of trying to get the members to violate their contracts to sign with another agency. While both parties denied the claim, Attrakt filed criminal charges against Ahn and three other individuals for fraud, breach of duty, and obstruction of business.\nThe ongoing lawsuit resulted in the cancellation of advertising contracts and the KCON LA 2023 appearance scheduled for August 19. Filming for the music video for \"Barbie Dreams\" from the Barbie movie soundtrack, released on July 6, also fell through. On August 28, the Seoul Central District Court sided with Attrakt against Fifty Fifty, dismissing the injunction. Fifty Fifty's law firm, Barun Law, stated that the group would immediately appeal against the dismissal. On October 17, one of the members, Keena, withdrew her lawsuit against Attrakt and returned to her original agency. On October 23, Attrakt announced the termination of the exclusive contracts of the remaining three members (Saena, Aran, and Sio) as of October 19. On October 24, the Seoul High Court upheld the decision to dismiss the injunction.\nOn October 29, Attrakt announced that Keena would be at the Billboard Music Awards on behalf of the group, with plans to re-organize the group in the future. On November 2, it was confirmed that the group would be continuing with a \"second generation\" of members, with Keena as part of the lineup, alongside three new members. On November 24, Fifty Fifty became the first K-pop girl group to enter the Billboard Hot 100 year-end, after \"Cupid\" ranked 44th in the list.\n\n\n=== 2024–present: Re-organization as 5-member group ===\n\nOn January 8, 2024, it was confirmed that auditions were conducted to recruit three to four new members to join Fifty Fifty alongside Keena, with a view to re-launch the group as a four or five-member girl group. One of these auditions was set to take place from January to February 2024 in the Southeast Asian region, specifically in Singapore and Thailand, to recruit new members in preparation for the re-debut of Fifty Fifty, which was slated to proceed in the second quarter of 2024. Attrakt's CEO Jeon Hong-joon and Singaporean K-pop singer David Yong (who is also CEO of a Singaporean company) are set to overlook the Southeast Asia audition as part of its judging panel.\nOn February 3, 2024, the first on-site audition took place at Kallang Place in Singapore, with about 120 youths, including those who were either Singaporeans or other nationalities, taking part in the auditions. A final round would take place in Thailand on February 17 to select three or four new members out of the finalists to join Fifty Fifty. Not only that, Attrakt also held auditions in Japan and South Korea for potential candidates to join Fifty Fifty. There is a tentative plan to complete the final lineup group in April 2024 and to re-debut Fifty Fifty in June 2024. Subsequently, the final audition in Thailand was rescheduled to take place on March 2, 2024. Subsequently, it was reported that three Singaporeans aged 16, 21 and 23 were selected through the on-site audition in Singapore and were among the finalists (including those from the online auditions) who would advance to the final audition round in Thailand. It was reported that there would be at least 30 or so candidates who would compete in the final audition.\nOn March 11, 2024, the three former Fifty Fifty members lost their breach of trust claim filed against Attrakt, after the police decided to dismiss the investigations of Attrakt on charges of alleged embezzlement, having found that there was no evidence of suspected criminal activity in the case. At the same time, Attrakt also announced that Fifty Fifty will tentatively re-debut in June or July 2024. Also, Attrakt had filed a lawsuit seeking compensation from the former members of Fifty Fifty, their parents, and the Givers' two executives Ahn Sung-il and Baek Jin-sil on the grounds that they were involved in an unjust breach of the three former members' contracts. The first hearing of this lawsuit was scheduled to begin on August 29, 2024. A 20 billion won lawsuit was also filed against Warner Music Korea for alleged attempts to poach Fifty Fifty.\nOn June 14, it was confirmed that Fifty Fifty would make their comeback in September 2024 as a five-member group, with four new members joining the new line-up with the current member Keena. A pre-release single is also confirmed to be in production, and scheduled to be released before their official comeback date.  On August 7, it was confirmed that the group will release their second EP on September 20, with a pre-release single to be released on August 30. Two days later, Chanelle, Yewon, and Hana were revealed as the three of the four new members. Prior to joining the group, Yewon and Chanelle were former trainees of Belift Lab and contestants of 2023 survival show R U Next?, which formed the girl group Illit. Hana was a 18-year-old former contestant of Mnet's children's song survival program We Kid in 2016. On August 12, Athena was revealed as the final new member.\nOn August 21, Fifty Fifty and Arista Records signed a partnership. The pre-release single \"Starry Night\" will also be included in the upcoming album. Apart from announcing the new line-up of Fifty Fifty, the fandom name of the group was renamed from \"Hunnies\" to \"Tweny\", to signify the new beginning of Fifty Fifty. Around the same time when the new lineup was publicized, the former Fifty Fifty members Sio, Aran, and Saena signed an exclusive contract with Massive E&C, a label under IOK Company, and would return to the entertainment industry in the future as the group, ablume.\nOn September 2, Fifty Fifty announced the title of their second mini album Love Tune. On September 20, Fifty Fifty made their comeback with the release of their second EP Love Tune, along with its lead single \"SOS\". On October 30, the special music video of the EP's B-side song, \"Gravity\" was released.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Single albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Promotional singles ===\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n=== Other videos ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Web shows ===\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website  (in English)"

    "text": "213 (pronounced \"Two One Three\") was an American hip hop group from Long Beach, California composed of Snoop Dogg, Warren G and Nate Dogg.  The name derives from Los Angeles' original telephone area code 213, which served the city of Long Beach at the time of the group's formation (it later became area code 562).\n\n\n== Background ==\nTheir breakthrough song was the minor hit \"Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None)\" from Snoop Dogg's solo debut Doggystyle, which also featured Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound. In 1994, they released the St. Ides EP. Since then, they continued to collaborate on each other's solo projects, but they didn't release any new material as a group. They got their name from Oakland rap group 415 as paying homage. August 17, 2004, they released their only studio album The Hard Way, which reached #4 in the U.S. Billboard 200 charts. It featured the singles, \"Groupie Luv\" and \"So Fly\".\nOn March 15, 2011, Nate Dogg died in Long Beach, California, from complications of multiple strokes, effectively disbanding 213.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Video albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\nA ^  \"Fly\" did not enter the Billboard Hot 100, but peaked at number 2 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot 100.\nB ^  \"Groupie Luv\" did not enter the Billboard Hot 100, but peaked at number 6 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot 100.\nC ^  \"Dolla Bill\" did not enter the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, but peaked at number 11 on the Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.\n\n\n== References =="

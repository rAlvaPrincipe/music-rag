    "text": "The Bushwackers Band, often simply the Bushwackers, are an Australian folk and country music band or bush band founded in 1970. Their cover version of \"And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda\" (1976) was listed in the APRA Top 30 Australian songs in 2001, alongside its writer Eric Bogle's 1980 rendition. Their top 60 studio albums on the Australian Kent Music Report are Bushfire (1978), Dance Album (1980), Faces in the Street and Beneath the Southern Cross (both 1981).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bushwackers Band were formed as the Original Bushwhackers and Bullockies Bush Band in 1970 in Melbourne by Dave Isom on guitar, banjo, vocals and mandolin; Bert Kahanoff on lagerphone and vocals; and Jan Wositzky on vocals, harmonica, banjo and percussion. Isom had started the La Trobe University Folk Club in 1969 and saw a concert by the Wild Colonial Boys at The Assembly Hall, Melbourne, with Kahanoff. Isom was inspired to form his own group, its name derives from a recording, Bullockies, Bushwhackers and Booze (1967) by various artists including Martyn Wyndham-Read, Peter Dickie and Jim Buchanan. Early gigs were in October 1971 by the trio who were later joined by various players, including Mick Slocum on accordion, concertina and vocals; and fiddlers Tony Hunt and Dave Kidd. Their debut album, The Shearers Dream, appeared in 1974 via Picture Records with the line-up of Hunt, Isom, Slocum and Wositsky joined by Dobe Newton on lagerphone, whistle and vocals.\nThe ensemble shortened their name to the Bushwackers Band and went full-time with their first tour to the United Kingdom. With an ever-changing line-up, and adding tin whistle, harmonica, concertina, 5-string banjo, bodhrán, bones, spoons, electric bass and guitar and drums the band worked throughout Australia and Europe. Their second album, And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda (1976), had Pete Howell on bass guitar joining the line-up of Hunt, Kidd, Newton, Slocum and Wositzky. It featured their cover version of the title song, which was written by Scottish-born Eric Bogle. \"And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda\" by the Bushwackers Band, alongside Bogle's 1980 rendition, was listed as one of the APRA Top 30 Australian songs in 2001 as part of the celebrations for the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA)'s 75th anniversary.\nTheir fourth studio album, Bushfire (1978), was produced by John Wood for Image Records and peaked at No. 37 on the Kent Music Report albums chart. By 1979 the line-up was Newton, Slocum and Wositsky joined by Steve Groves on vocals and guitar, Fred Kuhnl on vocals, bass guitar and moog and Gregory Martin on drums and percussion. The Bushwackers' fifth studio album, Dance Album (1980) used the line-up of Martin and Newton with Andy Colville on electric guitar, Roger Corbett on electric bass, Michael Harris on fiddle and viola, Louis McManus on fiddle, mandolin and acoustic guitar and Bill Smith on harmonica, bones, spoons, axes, bodhrán and cross-cut saw. The album peaked at No. 35 – the group's highest placing. Corbett became the group's principal songwriter, record producer and talent manager.\nIn 1981 they released two top 60 studio albums, Faces in the Street and Beneath the Southern Cross. By the following year the line-up of Corbett, Newton and McManus were joined by Danny Bourke on fiddle and vocals, Tommy Emmanuel on guitar and vocals (ex-the Southern Star Band, Goldrush) and Freddie Strauks on drums (ex-Skyhooks, the Sports). McManus was replaced by Tony O'Neill on mandolin, guitar and vocals and Harris rejoined in 1983 while Strauks was replaced on drums by Robbie Ross (ex-Goanna). In 1984 Newton disbanded the group except for reunion shows. In 1987 he co-wrote \"I Am Australian\" with Bruce Woodley of the Seekers. In 1993 Newton and Corbet reformed the Bushwackers Band (initially as the Range Rovers) with Pete Drummond (later with Dragon) on drums, Michael Fix on guitar (ex-Hat Trick), Mark Oats on fiddle and Melanie Williamson on piano accordion, guitar and vocals. Fix was soon replaced by Peter Malone on guitar, who was replaced in turn by Brad Johns and then Tim Gaze by 1995. Other members have included David Brannigan (The Colinails), Dave Mattacks, Pat Drummond, Eddy van Roosendael.\nIn August 2023, Newton and Corbett, performed a rendition of \"I Am Australian\", in their audition on the twelfth season of The Voice Australia, in which they received a four-chair turn before securing a place on coach Jessica Mauboy's team.\n\n\n== Members ==\nDave Isom – guitar, banjo, vocals, mandolin (1970-1976)\nBert Kahanoff – lagerphone (1970-1976)\nJan Wositzky a.k.a.

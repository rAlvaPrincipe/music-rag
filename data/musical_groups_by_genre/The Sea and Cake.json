    "text": "The Sea and Cake is an American indie rock band based in Chicago, Illinois, United States.\nThe group formed in the mid-1990s from members of The Coctails (Archer Prewitt), Shrimp Boat (Sam Prekop and Eric Claridge), and Tortoise (John McEntire); the group's name came from a willful reinterpretation of \"The C in Cake\", a song by Gastr del Sol, which McEntire was previously a member of. Starting with 1997's The Fawn, the group has relied on electronic instrumentation such as drum machines and synthesizers to color its music, but has retained its distinctive first wave post-rock style with marked influences from jazz and bossa nova. The band has shied away from releasing singles, preferring the album format.  Contrary to his multi-instrumentalist role in Tortoise, John McEntire almost exclusively plays drums in The Sea and Cake.\nMembers Sam Prekop, Archer Prewitt, and John McEntire have each released solo albums. The cover art of The Sea and Cake's releases are largely paintings by member Eric Claridge and photographs by Prekop. Prewitt has been involved in publishing his own comic books and doing graphic design.\nIn 1995, the band contributed the song \"The Fontana\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Bothered produced by the Red Hot Organization. The band was on hiatus from 2004 to 2007. Their most recent album Any Day was released in May 2018.\n\n\n== Members ==\nSam Prekop (vocals, guitar)\nArcher Prewitt (guitar, piano, vocals)\nJohn McEntire (percussion, drums, some synthesizer)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAll releases on Thrill Jockey Records unless noted.\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nThe Sea and Cake (1994)\nNassau (1995)\nThe Biz (1995)\nThe Fawn (1997)\nOui (2000)\nOne Bedroom (2003)\nEverybody (2007)\nCar Alarm (2008)\nThe Moonlight Butterfly (2011)\nRunner (2012)\nAny Day (2018)\n\n\n=== EPs and singles ===\n\"Glad You're Right\" (b/w \"Tiger Panther,\" \"Crimson Wing\", 7\" single, 1995, Lissy's Records [LISS1], limited edition of 500)\nTwo Gentlemen (12\" EP, mainly remixes, 1997)\n\"Window Lights\" (b/w \"Setup For Bed\" (a solo piece by John McEntire), 7\" single, 1999, Hefty Records [HEF013], also on Reach the Rock soundtrack, 1999)\nGlass (CD EP, 2003)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nA Brief Historical Retrospective (CD, 1997, Japanese-only compilation of first 2 albums, plus 7\" song \"Glad You're Right\")\nMetro: The Official Bootleg Series, Volume 1 2010\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nThe Sea and Cake at AllMusic\nThe Sea and Cake - Video Interview: \"What is really important to you?\"\nLazy-i Interview from February 2003\nInterview with Centerstage Chicago (June 2007)\nMarch 2011 - MÃ©tronome / Interview with Sam Prekop (Spanish)"

    "text": "Doctor and the Medics is a British glam rock band formed in London in 1981. The group was most successful during the 1980s and is best known for their cover of Norman Greenbaum's \"Spirit in the Sky,\" which reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart. The band currently performs with a newer and established line-up. As well as previously being classed a tribute act to various artists, they include many of their original songs in their live set. The group's musical style includes neo-psychedelia, glam rock, new wave and pop rock.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe Doctor and the Medics lead singer – Clive Jackson, born 7 July 1961 in Knotty Ash, Liverpool– a former London-based DJ, formed the group in 1981 with guitarist Steve McGuire, drummer Vom, also known as Steve Ritchie, bassist Richard Searle and female dancers and singers the Anadin Brothers. The group adopted a look inspired by both 1960s psychedelia and kabuki make-up similar to that of Kiss.\nTheir first single was \"The Druids Are Here, \" released on Whaam Records in 1982. They released no further records until 1985, but a four-track EP recorded live at Alice in Wonderland, a Soho nightclub where the Doctor was house DJ, was available direct from the band. The band's female backing singers, known as the Anadin Brothers, were originally three in number, but reduced to two members - Wendi West and Colette Appleby.\n\nIn 1985, they signed to IRS Records and released \"Happy but Twisted\", a five-track 12\" EP including a cover of Hawkwind's \"Silver Machine\". This reached number 2 on the indie charts. It was followed by \"The Miracle of the Age\", produced by Andy Partridge of XTC. Around this time, the band performed a concert in a television studio in Limehouse, London, which was recorded for television broadcast, although it was not shown at the time. At this concert, the line-up was augmented by Roman Jugg of the Damned on keyboards and second guitar.  There was another connection between the two groups; as \"Doctor\", Clive Jackson co-wrote The Damned's 1985 UK hit single \"Grimly Fiendish\".\nIn 1986, the band had an international hit with their next single, a cover of Norman Greenbaum's \"Spirit in the Sky\". The single reached number one in the UK. Their subsequent singles were less successful; \"Burn\" and \"Waterloo\" (the latter of which was a cover of the ABBA hit, with Roy Wood on saxophone, backing vocals and in the video). \"Burn\" reached number 29 in the UK Singles Chart and \"Waterloo\" reached number 45. The band released their final studio album Instant Heaven, in 1996 on their own 'Madman' record label.\nIn the early 2000s, the band's current line-up appeared on retro-themed British TV shows such as ITV1's Hit Me Baby One More Time, and a Top of the Pops Christmas special celebrating 50 years of the UK Singles Chart. In June 2006, the band appeared, with a new line-up, on Channel 4's Bring Back One Hit Wonders. Around this time they released an EP called Timewarped. They continue to perform live.\nIn December 2024, they played the Barrowland Ballroom supporting The Damned on their UK tour.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n1981 line-up\n\nThe Doctor (Clive Jackson) (vocals)\nSteve McGuire (guitar)\nRichard Searle (bass)\nAndrew McLachlan (drums)\n1986 line-up\n\nThe Doctor (vocals)\nSteve McGuire (guitar)\nRichard Searle (bass)\nSteve \"Vom\" Ritchie (drums)\nWendi Anadin (vocals)\nColette Anadin (vocals)\nRichard Searle left in 1990, shortly after Vom Ritchie departed.

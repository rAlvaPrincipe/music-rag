    "text": "Karanda is UK music project consisting of producer/DJ James Wood from Leicester, United Kingdom and Andrew Curd from Worthing, United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKaranda’s journey began in 2004, with James and Andi meeting online in an old mIRC chat room. Andi was the first DJ to truly support James’ music. James had early solo success signing with Andy Moor’s AVA record label, and received numerous support from Judge Jules on BBC Radio 1. In 2008, Karanda was born.\nTheir first track self-titled ’Karanda' received support from Armin van Buuren, and 'Shuffle' gained support from Judge Jules. Their first vocal track ‘On Hold’ featuring David Call was signed by Markus Schulz to Coldharbour, with numerous support from Rank 1, Sander van Doorn and many more. They remixed Markus Schulz’s 'Last Man Standing'. Later in 2011, they remixed Bart Claessen's 2010 track 'Hartseer' for Ferry Corsten’s ‘Full On Ferry’ compilation, gaining support from Above & Beyond. They travelled around the UK and Europe with shows in London, Amsterdam, Poznan and more.\nKaranda received the opportunity to officially remix Ellie Goulding's 'Beating Heart' from the Divergent film with their friend Andrew Wilson ('Offset'), and it was set to be released through Universal Music, but unfortunately the single release was cancelled. However, their remix still received airplay on Capital FM and KISS.\nHaving signed tracks with Armada, AVA and Coldharbour, Karanda signed with Enhanced Music in late 2011, where things really took off. With singles such as ‘Titan’ and ‘Kingpin’, a collaboration with Juventa, and remixes for Audien and Estiva, they gained further support from Above & Beyond, Paul van Dyk, Tritonal, tyDi, Cosmic Gate, Lange, Darude, and many more. Collaborations with Kathy Fisher, Store N Forward, Mike Shiver, Alana Aldea and more have proven to further show the diversity of the Karanda sound.\nIn 2016, Matt Darey got in touch after enjoying ‘Supreme’ on Rafael Frost’s record label, and they then remixed his single ‘Keep Talking’. Since then, James and Matt (both from Leicester) have gotten together on numerous occasions, and James was honoured to help recreate Matt’s legendary singles ‘Gamemaster’ and ‘Beautiful’ in order for Matt to perform them in Dolby Atmos 3D surround.\nKaranda currently host The Karanda Show every month on Afterhours.FM, and The Karanda Mix every week on Mixcloud.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2009 Karanda (Inov8)\n2009 In Motion (Coldharbour Recordings)\n2010 Shuffle (Inspired Digital)\n2010 On Hold (Feat.

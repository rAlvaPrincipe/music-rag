They only released one album as a group, Think About It in 1998.\nMichelle and Marie were born in San Diego, California while Tamica and Tanya are from Selma, Alabama. They teamed up to form the group, Elusion. Their debut album included their mildly received single, \"Reality\". The song has since achieved cult status. The album is notable for also including production by Missy Elliott before she became famous, on the track titled \"Good and Plenty\".\nTanya and Tamica formed a group called Nubreed.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n1998: Think About It (RCA)\nSingles\n1997: \"Reality\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\nwww.acerotwinsproductions.com\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.metacafe.com/watch/sy-36027671001/elusion_elusion_reality_official_music_video/\nIs It An Elusion Or Is It Reality"

They released 2007’s Tonight at the Arizona on Loose then self-released Adventures of the Felice Brothers Vol. 1.  James Felice said, \"We put one record out on an English label [Loose], and we've released all the other stuff ourselves [on their label New York Pro].” In 2007 the Felice Brothers played at Levon Helm's Midnight Ramble in Woodstock, New York and toured with Bright Eyes.\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\nOn January 7, it was announced The Felice Brothers had signed a record deal with Team Love Records in the US.

Due to torrential rains, high winds, and lightning storms, power was cut to the entire Newport, Rhode Island area.

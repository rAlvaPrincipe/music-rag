    "text": "Asonance is a Czech folk band established in 1976. They mainly play Scottish and Irish folk songs.\n\n\n== History ==\nAsonance was founded at Jan Neruda Grammar School in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in late 1976. Early members of the group include Jan and Pavel Lašťovička (the former is the last remaining founding member), Milan Štěrba, and František Korecký. The band primarily plays Scottish and Irish folk and country songs.\nIn 1977, Eva Fibingerová-Schneiderová and Denisa Vondráčková joined the band as vocalists, and Denisa also played guitar. Eva left the band a year later and was replaced by Blanka Štejfová (later Lašťovičková).\nIn 1980, Petr Vacek joined the vocal section of the band, and departed in 1984. He was replaced a year later by Roman Slaboch. 1990 saw Vacek rejoining the band. Other musicians who played with the group during this period include Renata Bělorová, Yveta Kasalická, Veronika Glyknerová, Alena Chvátalová, and Vendula Hugová, together with her husband, Jan Hugo. In 1982, Jan Ráb joined on violin.\nSecond violinist Jiří Nohel entered the group a few years later, and the twin violins became a trademark of the band. In 1985, Marta Fiklíková (later Nollová) joined, as well as Hana Horká. The band also added a double bass, bass guitar, and keyboards. Significantly for Asonance, future frontman Luboš Pick joined in the mid-1980s, and keyboardist Mirko Rokyta was added to the project in 1989.\nAsonance replaced their lead singer with Petr Bohuslav, and drummer Aleš Zimolka also played with the band until his death in 2012. He was replaced by David Růžička. The band also enlisted whistle player and vocalist Klára Lašťovičková (later Fanta), as well as additional whistle players Anna Rábová and Anežka Kufová (later Trnková).\nLongtime vocalist Hana Horká died on 16 January 2022 of complications from COVID-19, after deliberately exposing herself to the virus in order to get a health pass, instead of getting vaccinated.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\nCurrent\n\nJan Lašťovička – uilleann pipes, bouzouki, guitar, vocals (1976–present)\nBlanka Lašťovičková – vocals, bodhrán, percussion (1978–present)\nJan Ráb – violin (1982–present)\nRoman Slaboch – vocals (1984–present)\nLuboš Pick – bass guitar, guitar, bouzouki, vocals (1987–present)\nMirko Rokyta – keyboards (1989–present)\nPetr Bohuslav – vocals (2002–present)\nKlára Fanta – whistle, flute, vocals (2005–present)\nDaniela Vránová – flute, whistle (2016–present)\nJan Gajdoš Doležal – drums (2016–present)\nPast\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAsonance discography at Discogs"

    "text": "Client Liaison is an Australian indie pop duo made up of vocalist Monte Morgan, and keyboardist and producer Harvey Miller. The pair first came to prominence in 2012 after the release of their first music video \"End of the Earth\", and went on to release a self-titled EP in 2014, and studio album Diplomatic Immunity in 2016. Their second studio album, Divine Intervention was released on 1 October 2021.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nClient Liaison was formed in Melbourne in 2009 by former Geelong Grammar schoolmates Monte Morgan (born 1985) and Harvey Miller (born 22 May 1988).\nInfluenced by late '80s and early '90s electronic and house music, the pair produces a style of music described by them as \"faux-fi\", and incorporate a similar 1980s Australia theme into their personas. As part of this image, the pair draw a wide range of Australian references into their performances and music videos, and often make reference to brands such Ansett, Foster's, and Diners Club, and have named Tina Arena and John Farnham as being amongst the many influences on their music.\nWhen performing live, the duo expands to include Miller's brother Geordie Miller on guitar and saxophone, and former Triple J Hack presenter (2011-2019) Tom Tilley, whom Miller had met through a previous girlfriend, on bass.\nBoth Monte and Harvey attended the private Geelong Grammar School. The former is the son of executive-chairman of Roy Morgan Research, Gary Morgan, the latter is the son of director George T. Miller. The duo bases themselves in a Collins Street office space owned by Morgan's father's company. \nMorgan studied general arts at the University of Melbourne. Miller, who studied fine arts at the Victorian College of the Arts, frequently uses the postnominal AO after his name, describing himself as a \"self-appointed\" member of the Order of Australia — he is not, in reality, a member.\n\n\n=== 2012–2016: Client Liaison ===\nIn mid-2012, Client Liaison released the music video for \"End of the Earth\", a song Morgan had written five years prior during a time when he was \"angry with Australia\" and its culture cringe. The video, featuring the pair in '80s pop clothing performing in front of a montage of iconic Australian clips, became a cult hit on YouTube.\nIt was not until over a year later, on 29 August 2014, that the duo released their first EP, eponymously titled Client Liaison. The music video for the single \"Queen\" was filmed on a VHS camcorder and made reference to the clip for the Womack and Womack song \"Teardrops\".\nThe pair played their first national tour as a support act for Miami Horror, and later went on to support Flight Facilities on their national and international tours.\nAt the 2014 J Awards, the duo were nominated for best music video for their song \"Free of Fear\" but lost to \"Chandelier\" by Sia.\n\n\n=== 2016–2017: Diplomatic Immunity ===\n\nClient Liaison's first studio album Diplomatic Immunity was released on 4 November 2016. The pair described the theme of the album as being of them as \"diplomats flying the Australian flag, taking Australia to the world\". The duo collaborated with Cleopold, Flight Facilities and Tina Arena while producing the album. The music video for \"Wild Life\", the album's second single, makes references to Qintex, the former company run by businessman-turned-fugitive Christopher Skase. The album's fourth single, \"A Foreign Affair\", features Tina Arena and makes reference to her 1995 song Sorrento Moon. As part of the release of the album, Client Liaison announced that in place of ordinary band merchandise they would be releasing a line of clothing named the \"Client Liaison: Deluxe Line\" with the assistance of stylist Kirsty Barros.\nThe pair performed at Firefly Music Festival, Splendour in the Grass, and Secret Garden Festival in 2015, Groovin' the Moo and The Falls Music and Arts Festival in 2016, and Field Day in 2017. The band commenced a world tour titled \"A Foreign Affair\" in August 2017. In November, the group won Australian Music Video of the Year at the 2017 J Awards for \"A Foreign Affair\", which was directed by Tim White.\n\n\n=== 2018–present: Divine Intervention ===\n\nIn May 2018, Client Liaison released \"Survival in the City\".\nIn August 2019, Client Liaison released \"The Real Thing\", and confirmed they are working on a second studio album. In November 2019, Client Liaison released \"Champagne Affection\". In June 2021, Client Liaison announced the released of their second studio album Divine Intervention, released on 1 October 2021.\nDivine Intervention became the band's first ARIA top ten album, debuting at number 7.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== Remixes ====\n\"Cruel\", The Preatures (June 2015)\n\"90s Music\", Kimbra (August 2014)\n\"Rain\", Retiree (February 2014)\n\"Oh Innocence\", Dúné (March 2013)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== AIR Awards ===\nThe Australian Independent Record Awards (commonly known informally as AIR Awards) is an annual awards night to recognise, promote and celebrate the success of Australia's Independent Music sector.\n\n\n=== ARIA Music Awards ===\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music.

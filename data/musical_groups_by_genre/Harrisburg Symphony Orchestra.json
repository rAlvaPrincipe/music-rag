    "text": "The Harrisburg Symphony Orchestra (HSO) is an American orchestra based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, US.\nThe Harrisburg Symphony Orchestra can be traced back to the early 1930s during the throes of the Great Depression. The orchestra gave its first concert at William Penn High School in Harrisburg on March 19, 1931. The conductor on that occasion was Maestro George King Raudenbush, who was to become the orchestra's first music director. By the end of 1931 the orchestra had moved its concerts to the newly opened Forum Auditorium, part of the Capitol Complex, where it still performs to this day. The 1931–32 season included four concerts. The cost of a subscription: $2.00.\nThe orchestra membership consists of professional players from Central Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, New York, and other regions. Being able to select from such a wide variety of talent pools enables the HSO to perform at a particularly high artistic level. The HSO membership is represented by American Federation of Musicians (AFM) Local 269, and the group is a member of ROPA, the Regional Orchestra Players' Association.\n\n\n== Music directors ==\n1931-1950: George King Raudenbush\n1950-1974: Edwin McArthur\n1974-1978: David Epstein\n1978-1994: Larry Newland\n1995-1999: Richard Westerfield\n2000–Present: Stuart Malina\n\n\n== Youth Symphony Orchestra ==\nThe Harrisburg Youth Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1953 and one of the oldest youth symphonies in the country.

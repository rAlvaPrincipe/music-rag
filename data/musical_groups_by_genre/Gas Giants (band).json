    "text": "Gas Giants were a pop rock band from Tempe, Arizona, formed as a successor project to the Gin Blossoms. The group was known as The Pharaohs when they formed in 1997, but changed their name after their label, A&M Records, merged with Universal Records and the band changed hands, re-signing with Interscope Records. Eventually, the group released their album, From Beyond the Back Burner, in 1999 on indie Atomic Pop Records. Comic book artist Geof Darrow provided the artwork for the album. The band featured Gin Blossoms members Robin Wilson, Phillip Rhodes and Daniel Henzerling, as well as Mickey Ferrel, who was previously in the band Grievous Angels. Henzerling was the drummer for the Gin Blossoms before the current drummer, Phillip Rhodes. The band toured with Train in 2000 behind the band's only single, \"Quitter\".\nBecause the Gin Blossoms have reunited as of 2006, Gas Giants appear to be on indefinite hiatus.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nRobin Wilson – lead vocals, guitar\nDaniel Henzerling – lead guitar, vocals\nPhillip Rhodes – drums, vocals\nMickey Ferrell – bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\nFrom Beyond the Back Burner (1999, Atomic Pop Records)\nOther appearance\n\nLive in the X Lounge III – \"Quitter\" (live, 2000)\nBoys and Girls (2000 film) soundtrack – \"Quitter\" (2000)\nGas Giants members were also featured on The Poppin' Wheelies (2000, Uranus Laboratories Inc.).

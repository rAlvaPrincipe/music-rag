    "text": "Oaktown's 3.5.7 was a rap group formed by MC Hammer in 1989, via his Bust It Records label and Capitol Records. Members included Sweet L.D. (Suhayla Sabir), Lil P (Phyllis Charles) and Terrible T (Tabatha Zee King-Brooks).\nHammer dubbed the group's name as a salute to their hometown of Oakland, and to emphasize the power of the trio as dancers (comparing them to a .357 Magnum).\nTheir 1989 album, Wild & Loose, peaked at number 126 on the Billboard 200 and number 23 on the Top R&B Albums chart. Their single, \"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\", peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart.\nThe group disbanded in 1992.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\nWild & Loose (1989)\nFully Loaded (1991)\nEPs\nFila Treatment (1992)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography on AllMusic"

P-Lo, inspired by Kanye West's debut album The College Dropout (2004), began creating beats in his youth. P-Lo most notably produced Wiz Khalifa's \"Bout Me\" and Yo Gotti's single \"Act Right,\" the latter of which entered the Billboard Hot 100. P-Lo joined Iamsu! in the formation of the production team \"The Invasion\" shortly after their meeting, starting a trend of collaboration between future members. Iamsu! also collaborated with Sage the Gemini on his single \"Gas Pedal\" in March 2013, which peaked at number on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs and at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it both artists' first top 40 hit.\n\n\n=== Early releases ===\nThe Heartbreak Gang was performing and releasing music as early as 2011 and in August 2011, performed at the debut release party for Tha Outfit's \"Like My Bass\" music video.

It includes 17 tracks featuring different members of the collective. Much of the album's production was handled by the Invasion (the production team of Iamsu!, P-Lo, Kuya Beats, Jay Ant, and Chief), with tracks also produced by Cardo, AKA Frank, Kuya Beats, Sage the Gemini, and Jay Ant.\n\n\n=== Touring, music videos ===\nThe collective toured the western United States during September and August 2013, hitting locations such as Seattle, Spokane, Phoenix, Santa Barbara, and Reno, Nevada.

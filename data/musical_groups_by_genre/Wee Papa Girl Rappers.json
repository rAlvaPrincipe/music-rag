    "text": "Wee Papa Girl Rappers were a British female rap duo, that found chart success in the late 1980s. They were sisters Sandra (the elder of the two, aka Total S) and Samantha Lawrence (aka TY Tim).\nBefore being signed to Jive Records, the two sisters were backing singers for Feargal Sharkey. As the Wee Papa Girl Rappers, they started to appear on the BBC Radio London rap show, hosted by Dave Pearce. Their first record, \"Heat it Up\" featuring 2 Men and a Drum Machine, reached number 21 on the UK Singles Chart in June 1988. The Wee Papa Girls Rappers are best remembered for the single \"Wee Rule\" – more inspired by reggae and dancehall than hip hop – which reached number 6 on the UK Singles Chart in October 1988.\nThey released two albums on Jive, The Beat, the Rhyme, the Noise in 1988, and Be Aware in 1990 (the latter featuring the club hit Get In The Groove). They released two further singles in 1992 and 1994, as the Wee Papas.\nThe duo got their name \"Wee Papa\" from the Saint Lucia French Creole expression \"Oui Papa\", which their father (originating from the Caribbean Island), frequently uttered.\nSamantha Lawrence died on 1 December 2024, aged 55.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWee Papa Girl Rappers discography at Discogs\nWee Papa Girl Rappers at IMDb\nSamantha Lawrence at IMDb\nSandra Lawrence at IMDb"

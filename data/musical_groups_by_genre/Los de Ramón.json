    "text": "Los de Ramón are a Chilean folkloric group, composed of the family group of Raul de Ramon, his wife Maria Eugenia and his two children Carlos Alberto and Raul Eduardo. With Chomedahue —in the commune of Santa Cruz— as their origin, they were dedicated to the investigation of Chilean and Latin American folklore interpreting its songs with the typical instruments of each country having in its presentations more of sixty different musical instruments played by themselves which were interchanged according to each country and region. They gave numerous concerts in the US (92 concerts), Mexico, and in the rest of Latin America.\nThey recorded more than thirteen longplays two of them made in Mexico with music from Chile and also from Latin America. Some of them are  Arreo en el Viento,  Nostagia Colchaguina, An image of Chile, Latino America folkloric Panorama (2 discs), Los de Ramon in Family, Chilean Mass and others. They received several prizes in Chile as in Mexico and made popular many songs of Raul de Ramon like The Curanto, Rosa Colorada, Nostalgia Colchaguina, Camino de Soledad, Cancion de la Caballeria among others. They were the first in Chile in using the typical instruments of each country influencing in other musical groups that adopted this initiative later. They became part of the traditional folkloric music that gave impulse to Chilean music.\nThe band opened a restaurant named El Alero de Los de Ramon, dedicated to the diffusion of folkloric music and their traditions.\nThey also contribute in the creation of new folkloric musical groups such as Los Cantores de Santa Cruz and Los de Santiago among others.\nRaul de Ramon and Maria Eugenia were declared Illustrious Sons of Santa Cruz in Colchagua and with their children they have a space in the Museum of Colchagua in this city. Nowadays only their sons are still alive, Raul de Ramon died in April 1984 and Maria Eugenia in March 2002\n\n\n== Discography ==\nLos de Ramón (1960)\nFiesta Venezolana (1961)\nArreo en el Viento (1962)\nNostalgia Colchaguina (1963)\nUna Imagen de Chile (1964)\nPaisaje Humano de Chile (1966)\nPanorama Folklorico Latinoamericano (2) (1966)\nLos de Ramón en Familia (1967)\nEl Arca de Los de Ramón (1968)\nLos de Ramón en América (1969)\nViento en el Tamarugal (1968)\nMisa Chilena (1965)\nLo Mejor de Los de Ramón (1979)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Spanish)"

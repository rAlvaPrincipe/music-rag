    "text": "Heldon was a French electronic rock band originally active between 1974 and 1978, and led by guitarist Richard Pinhas. Other members included synthesizer player Patrick Gauthier and drummer François Auger. The name of the band was taken from the 1972 novel The Iron Dream by Norman Spinrad.\nInfluenced by the work of Robert Fripp (and sometimes evoking his work with Brian Eno), the music of Heldon blended electronic and rock forms. The first releases under the name Schizo, and later Heldon, were self-produced and self-distributed. Jim Dorsch from AllMusic would later describe Heldon's seven albums as \"groundbreaking.\"\nPinhas had previously led the band Schizo and also released six albums under his own name. Pinhas has worked with numerous collaborators, including musicians of the band Magma, and music journalist and multi-instrumentalist  Hervé Picart. He was also associated with philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze (of whom he was a student). and Jean-François Lyotard, as well as writers such as Norman Spinrad and the essayist and novelist Maurice Dantec. Pinhas completed his PhD in Philosophy from the Paris-Sorbonne University in 1974, teaching for one year and beginning Heldon.\nThe Pinhas/Heldon catalog was reissued on CD by the label Cuneiform, and later Bureau B.\n\n\n== Discography of Richard Pinhas and Heldon ==\nSchizo : And The Little Girl/Paraphrénia Praecox (1972) (7\")\nSchizo : Le Voyageur/Torcol (1972) (7\")\nHeldon : Électronique Guerilla (1974)\nHeldon : Allez Téia (1974)\nHeldon : Third (It's Always Rock and Roll) (1975)\nHeldon : Soutien à la RAF (7\") (1975)\nHeldon : Agneta Nilsson (1976)\nHeldon : Perspective 1 bis complément/Perspective 4 bis (1976) (7\")\nHeldon : Un Rêve Sans Conséquence Spéciale (1976)\nRichard Pinhas : Rhizosphère (1977)\nT.H.X. : Telstar / Rhizosphère Suite (1978) (7\")\nRichard Dunn : Séquences/Modulations (1978) (7\")\nRichard Pinhas : Chronolyse (1978)\nOse : Adonia (1978)\nHeldon : Interface (1977)\nHeldon : Stand By (1979)\nRichard Pinhas : Iceland (1979)\nRichard Pinhas : East West (1980)\nRichard Pinhas : L'Ethique (1982)\nRichard Pinhas Heldon : Perspective (1983)\nRichard Pinhas : DWW (1992)\nRichard Pinhas & John Livengood : Cyborg Sally (1994)\nRichard Pinhas & John Livengood : Single (1996)\nRichard Pinhas : De l'Un et du Multiple (1997)\nSchizotrope : Le Plan (1999)\nRichard Pinhas & Peter Frohmader: Fossil Culture (1999)\nPascal Comelade & Richard Pinhas : Oblique Sessions II (1999)\nSchizotrope : The Life And Death Of Marie Zorn - North American Tour 1999 (2000)\nSchizotrope : III Le Pli (2001)\nHeldon : Only Chaos is Real (2001)\nRichard Pinhas : Event and Repetitions (2003)\nRichard Pinhas : Tranzition (2004)\nRichard Pinhas : Metatron (2006, 2CDs)\nRichard Pinhas & Merzbow : Keio Line (2008, 2CDs)\nRichard Pinhas : Metal/Crystal (2010, 2CDs) with Merzbow & Wolf Eyes\nRåd Kjetil Senza Testa : Vinliden (2010, LP) with Richard Pinhas and RKST.\nRichard Pinhas & Merzbow : Rhizome (2011)\nRichard Pinhas & Merzbow : Paris 2008 (2011, LP)\nRichard Pinhas : Desolation Row (2013)\nThe majority of recordings of Richard Pinhas and Heldon were pressed on CD by French label Spalax and American label Cuneiform Records, featuring numerous bonus tracks.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nChronolyse review\nRhizosphère review\nIceland review\nEast West review\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Richard Pinhas website\nRichard Pinhas/Heldon chez Cuneiform Records"

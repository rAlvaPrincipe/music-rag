    "text": "The L.A. Four (or The L.A. 4) was a jazz quartet, formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1974, that performed until 1982.\nIts members were guitarist Laurindo Almeida, saxophonist and flutist Bud Shank, bassist Ray Brown, and drummer Shelly Manne, replaced by Jeff Hamilton after 1977. They performed a mixture of straight-ahead jazz on the \"cool\" side, influenced by European Classical music, and bossa nova and samba (Almeida was born in Brazil). They recorded ten albums before disbanding. Chuck Flores was the group's original drummer but did not record with them.\nThe group toured Australia in 1975.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1975: The L.A.

    "text": "The Band of the Scots Guards is one of five bands in the Foot Guards Regiments in the Household Division which primarily guards the British monarch.\nThe band is based at Wellington Barracks in St James's, London, which is the same place as for all the foot guards bands. The band should not be confused with the Pipes and Drums, which is a separate entity comprising fighting soldiers who are also pipers, rather than full-time professional musicians.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Scots Guards is a regiment that was formed by King Charles I in 1642. It is known that in 1716 a small band of \"hautbouys\" existed; however, the precise origins of the Band of the Scots Guards are unknown.\nThe band grew in strength during the early part of the 19th century and by 1838, it could boast some 32 performers. Throughout the 19th century the band expanded, until in 1888, there was an establishment of 44.\nDuring the First World War it entertained troops at Ypres and the Somme in 1916. During the Second World War it was entertaining troops on the home front. This was sometimes through the medium of wireless, an example being 18 March 1942, when at 1 am, band members reported for a BBC Overseas Broadcast at the Paris Cinema. Musicians also found themselves on Fire Watch duties based at Egerton House, Buckingham Gate.\nThe Scots Guards was the only Foot Guards Band to be deployed on active service during the Gulf War in 1990 (with three of their colleagues from the Irish Guards Band). Many different aspects of hospital duties attached to the various departments of 33 General Hospital based in Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia were involved in their work there. In 1992, the Colonel of the Regiment, The Duke of Kent presented Gulf War Medals to Band members.\n\n\n== Regimental Marches ==\nThe Regimental Quick March is Hielan' Laddie. The Regimental Slow March is The Garb of Old Gaul.\n\n\n== Ensembles ==\nThere are several ensembles within the Band of the Scots Guards:\n\nConcert band\nMarching band\nDance band\nFanfare Trumpeters\nBrass Quintet\nWind Quintet\nString Quartet\nOrchestra\nJazz Ensemble\n\n\n== Functions ==\n\nThe Band of the Scots Guards plays for events of state as part of the  Massed Bands of the Household Division.

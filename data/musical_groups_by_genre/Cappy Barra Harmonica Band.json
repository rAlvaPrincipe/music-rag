    "text": "The Cappy Barra Harmonica Band was an American harmonica ensemble — originally a trio, then a quartet, then two groups — that played big band arrangements. Cappy Barra flourished from 1935 to 1945.\n\n\n== History ==\n1938 to 1942\n\nCappy Barra was assembled by promoter Maurice Duke. The name was derived from \"capybara,\" the largest extant rodent in the world, native to South America. In 1940, Sam Scheckter and Sam Sperling left the group, George Fields replaced Schekter. Shortly after, the act split into two groups. The first unit worked primarily in the Chicago area. A second unit, based in New York, formed around Phil King, who enlisted newcomers George Fields, Charley Leighton, Alan Greene and Pro Robbins (né Irving Rubenstein).\nThe Chicago unit, a trio, disbanded in 1942 when Nat Bergman and Cappy LaFell enlisted in the Armed Forces. Don Ripps returned to Freeport, Texas.\nThe New York unit worked steadily in vaudeville and in nightclubs through the war years. George Fields left in 1941 to move to California, and the group played as a trio, with Charles Leighton handling the lead, Alan Greene playing chord harp and singing, and Pro Robbins on bass harp. Phil King booked the band, played an occasional Polyphonia, did comedy bits, and fronted the group. The group disbanded in 1944.\nPost World War II\n\nAround 1945, Duke reorganized Cappy Barra as a quartet and moved it to Los Angeles with the aim of getting Hollywood studio work. The performers were Charley Leighton on lead, George Fields on second, Pete Petersen on third, and Pro Robbins on fourth.\nPerforming members\n\nCappy LaFell (né Leon S.

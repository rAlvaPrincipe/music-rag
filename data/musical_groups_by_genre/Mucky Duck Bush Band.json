    "text": "The Mucky Duck Bush Band, often called Mucky Duck, is a Western Australian Australian folk and country music band or bush band formed in 1973 and still active today, in Perth and Western Australia. \nThe band was founded by Stan Hastings, who ran the folk club The Stables in Northbridge, and his son Greg Hastings. They turned professional in 1978, touring around Western Australia.\nIn 1982 they performed a musical Moondyne Joe (about the bushranger of that name) at the Regal Theatre in Subiaco.\nThe group had a changing lineup over the years and in 2003 it was revealed that English writers had made the dubious claim that their lineup had included Lord Lucan.\n\nMucky Duck's current lineup (since 2002) is Don Blue (guitar, whistle, vocals), John Perry (bass, vocals) and Erik Kowarski (fiddle, guitar, vocals).  For some performances they are joined by Bob Emery (mandolin, guitar, vocals).\n\n\n== Discography and works ==\nThe Mucky Duck Bush Band (1980), At last the Mucky Duck album, Grass Roots Productions, retrieved 27 December 2013\nMucky Duck Bush Band (1982), Dance on with the Duck an introduction to early colonial dances, Thank-You-Both Productions, Greenmount, W.A. : Edwest [distributor], retrieved 27 December 2013\nLife.

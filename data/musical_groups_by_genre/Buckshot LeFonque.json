    "text": "Buckshot LeFonque was a musical group project led by Branford Marsalis. \nThe name Buckshot LeFonque was derived by Marsalis from 'Buckshot La Funke', a pseudonym used for contractual reasons by jazz saxophonist, Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley, on the album Here Comes Louis Smith (1958). After playing with Sting, Miles Davis and other artists, Marsalis founded this band to create a new sound by merging classic jazz with rock, pop, R&B and hip-hop influences.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBuckshot LeFonque began primarily as a collaboration between Branford Marsalis and DJ Premier.  Marsalis moved from New York to Los Angeles in 1992 to commence work as the Musical Director on the Tonight Show, which had acquired Jay Leno as its new host. Marsalis hosted DJ Premier, as well as Engineer Ben Austin, in his Los Angeles residence, and began composition on the album. He assembled a recording band primarily from the jazz players in the Tonight Show Band, which included Jeff Watts, Robert Hurst, Kenny Kirland, Kevin Eubanks. The band recorded at Sony Studios Los Angeles summer of 1993.\nTwo albums were released, Buckshot LeFonque (1994) (which featured mostly DJ Premier produced tracks) and the follow-up Music Evolution (1997) (which featured mostly Frank McComb on the vocals).

    "text": "The Stone Coyotes are an American band that debuted with their first album in 1998. They hail from Massachusetts but tour primarily in Texas as that is where they receive their most radio airplay.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBarbara Keith founded the family-revolved band in Massachusetts with her family. Doug Tibbles was her husband, and his son John Tibbles is her stepson.  Barbara Keith is mainly the guitarist, and also writes most of their songs. Doug started playing drums for the band shortly before the trio was formed, when Keith was signed with Warner Brothers. John learned to play the bass guitar at eleven and started playing in the band when he was eighteen.\nDouglas Tibbles died on April 12, 2023, at the age of 83.\n\n\n== Be Cool ==\nBe Cool is a New York Times bestselling crime novel written by Elmore Leonard. The novel, published in 1999, is the sequel to Get Shorty (1990), and was made into a major motion picture in 2005. Barbara Keith was a major influence to this novel, especially its plot.

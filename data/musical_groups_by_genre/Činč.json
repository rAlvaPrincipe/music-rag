    "text": "Činč (Serbian Cyrillic: Чинч, pronounced [tʃintʃ]) is a Serbian band that Đorđe Ilić and Luka Stanisavljević formed in 2001. Before that, the duo performed for several years under the name Čudan Šimijev Bend. In 2003 and in 2004, respectively, Irena Vanić and Srđan Stojanović joined the band. Činč's notable features are weird lyrics, sophisticated melodies and peculiar scene acting. The band performs at cultural centers, libraries, galleries, radio stations and Belgrade's botanical garden. Činč’s collaborations includes artists like Yoshio Machida, Marko Brecelj (ex-Buldožer), Saša Marković Mikrob, and strip-workshop Šlic.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nOsečev sjaj (Škart, 2001, reissue Amorfon, 2004)\nPonašanje (Templum, 2003, reissue Listen Loudest, 2007)\nPolyphonic Poetry (Amorfon, 2006)\nKalendář (independent web release, cincplug.com 2011)\n\n\n=== Various artists compilations ===\nMusic for Baby (Amorfon, 2004)\n11. bombardiranje Njujorka (Listen Loudest, 2007)\nŠta treba maloj deci (Kornet, 2007)\n\n\n== Band members ==\nLuka Stanisavljević — bass guitar, guitar, vocals, Matrix decoder\nĐorđe Ilić — guitar, vocals, percussions\nIrena Vanić — vocals\nSrđan Stojanović — violin, vocals\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nMySpace presentation\nMySpace video presentation"

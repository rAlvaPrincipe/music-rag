    "text": "I Muvrini is a Corsican folk music group, who sing traditional Corsican music in their native Corsican language.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was formed in the early 1980s by the brothers Jean-François Bernardini and Alain Bernardini both born in the village of Tagliu-Isulacciu in the north of Corsica. They are named after a species of wild sheep (mouflon) which live in the mountains of Corsica.\nThe Bernardini brothers were introduced to traditional Corsican music at an early age by their father, Ghjuliu, who was a well-known poet and singer. They recorded their first single with their father in collaboration with the group Canta u Populu Corsu. Ghjuliu Bernardini died in December 1977 and I Muvrini's first album, I Muvrini ... ti ringrazianu, which was released in 1979, was dedicated to their father's memory.\nIn 2000, I Muvrini joined up with Sting to record \"Terre d'Oru\" (English: \"Fields of Gold\").\nThroughout their career they have promoted the Corsican language and culture, much like the work pioneered by Les Nouvelles Polyphonies corses.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n1979 - ...Ti ringrazianu\n1980 - Anu da vultà\n1981 - ...È campà quì\n1984 - Lacrime\n1985 - 85\n1986 - À l'encre rouge\n1988 - Pè l'amore di tè...\n1989 - Quorum\n1991 - À voce rivolta\n1993 - Noi\n1995 - Curagiu\n1998 - Leia\n2002 - Umani\n2005 - Alma\n2007 - I Muvrini et les 500 choristes\n2010 - Gioia\n2012 - Imaginà\n2015 - Invicta\n2016 - Pianetta\n2017 - Luciole\n2019 - Portu in core\n2022 - Piu forti\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n1998 - Sò\n2000 - Pulifunie\n2000 - A strada\n2013 - Best of (3 CDs)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n1990 - In core\n1994 - Zenith 93\n1996 - Bercy 96\n2006 - ALMA 2005\n\n\n=== Videos / DVDs ===\nI Muvrini at Bercy '96\nGiru FR3 \nZenith '92\nTerra\nAlma 2005\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\n1999 - Άσε την εικόνα να μιλάει (\"Let the Picture Speak\") with Pyx Lax.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nI Muvrini official web site (in English)\nTerracorsa, information on I Muvrini and Corsica (in English)\nCuragiu, information (in French)"

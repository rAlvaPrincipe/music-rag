    "text": "The Beef Seeds were a British country music and bluegrass band which was an artist collaboration project with Ryde/. Digital Media focusing on digital platforms that has achieved worldwide status and global media recognition. The band hails from Newport, South Wales, it was formed in early 2013, and it records and publishes cover videos on its YouTube channel. The band's line-up consists of Peet \"Bongo Peet\" Morgan, Becky \"Miss Becky\" Johnson, Scott \"Showman\" Bowman, and Adam Beale.  The band all live together in the same house with their dog Ninja, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier-Chihuahua cross who is also the mascot of the band making regular appearances in the videos.  Instruments used in their songs include the Guitar, Mandolin, Banjo, Double bass, Harmonica, Washboard, and the Double washboard, which band frontman Peet Morgan invented himself.\nThe Beef Seeds' bluegrass cover of \"Royals\" by Lorde received praise from MTV Italy, which featured the video on their website and from multiple US radio stations including San Francisco radio station 97.3-FM (KLLC) and from Australian news site Daily Life, which described it as an \"twangy\" and \"harmony-laden.\" In early 2014, it was mentioned on major Brazilian portal and Internet service provider Globo.com.\nThe Beef Seeds' various videos that are published on their YouTube site have collectively been watched more than two million times.  The Beef Seeds were looking to tour the United States in 2014.\nNotably, The Beef Seeds' version of The Pogues' Christmas classic, \"Fairytale of New York,\" which they aptly renamed \"Fairytale of Newport\" (as a hat tip to their own town of Newport in South Wales), has become a festive online hit.  The music video follows the band and their official mascot, Ninja, around Newport's city centre.\nOn 22 October 2013, RyanSecrest.com announced a contest to determine music fans' favourite cover version of Swedish DJ Avicii's hit single, \"Wake Me Up.\" A total of fifteen artists' cover versions of this song, including The Beef Seeds' version, were included for voting by readers of the site.

    "text": "Bud & Travis was an American folk music duo from San Francisco, California, consisting of Bud Dashiell and Travis Edmonson that collaborated from 1958 to 1965.\n\n\n== History ==\nBud & Travis began recording together in 1958; Edmonson was related to Colin Edmonson, whom Dashiell had met while serving in the Korean War. Travis Edmonson had previously been a member of the Gateway Singers. They released multiple singles and albums and toured widely before splitting in 1965, becoming significant musicians on the folk revival circuit.\nBud & Travis appeared as the musical act the \"coffee house duo\" in the 1959 episode of \"The M Squad\" entitled \"The Fire Makers\".\nEdmonson and Dashiell reportedly had frequent clashes, and the duo separated from 1960 to 1963. During this period Dashiell issued several records with The Kinsmen, and Edmonson put out several solo albums. Dashiell went solo after their final breakup in 1965, releasing an album in 1968.  He taught late in life, and died in 1989 as a result of a brain tumor. Edmonson toured regularly in the 1970s as a solo act. He died on May 9, 2009.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSingles\nBud & Travis\n\n\"Mexican Wedding Dance (La Bamba)\" / \"Raspberries, Strawberries (Le Chanson De La Framboise)\" (World Pacific X-801, 1958)\n\"Bonsoir Dame (Good Night My Lady Love)\" / \"Truly Do\" (Liberty 55202, 1959)\n\"Poor Boy\" / \"Jenny On A Horse\" (Liberty 55221, 1959)\n\"Cloudy Summer Afternoon\" / \"E La Bas\" (Liberty 55235, 1960)\n\"Come To The Dance (Vamos Al Baile)\" / \"Carmen Carmelia\" (Liberty 55259, 1960)\n\"Ballad Of The Alamo\" / \"The Green Leaves of Summer\" (Liberty 55284, 1960), #64\n\"Tomorrow Is A Long Time\" / \"Haiti\" (Liberty 55612, 1963)\n\"Maria Cristina\" / \"Sabras Que Te Quiero\" (Liberty 55681, 1964)\n\"How Long, How Long Blues\" / \"Gimme Some\" (Liberty 55713, 1964)\n\"I Talk To The Trees\" / \"A Moment In The Sun\" (Liberty 55764, 1965)\n\"Cold Summer\" / \"Girl Sittin‘ Up In A Tree\" (Liberty 55803, 1965)\nBud Dashiell and the Kinsmen\n\n\"Pom Pa Lom\" / \"I Talk To The Trees\" (Warner Bros. 5231, 1961)\n\"In Tarrytown\" / \"Big Manuel\" (Warner Bros. 5276, 1962)\nBud Dashiell\n\n\"I Think It's Gonna Rain Today\" / \"Seasons In The Sun\" (Warner Bros. 7157, 1968)\nTravis Edmonson\n\n\"The Web\" / \"Cuanta La Mera (Guantanamera)\" (Reprise 20,071, 1962)\nAlbums\nBud & Travis\n\nBud & Travis (Liberty LRP-3125/LST-7125, 1959)\nSpotlight on Bud & Travis (Liberty LRP-3138/LST-7138, 1960)\nBud & Travis...In Concert (Liberty LDM-11001/LDS-12001, 1960) U.S. #126\nBud & Travis In Concert, Volume 2 (Liberty LRP-3222/LST-7222, 1960)\nNaturally (Liberty LRP-3295/LST-7295, 1963)\nPerspective on Bud & Travis (Liberty LRP-3295/LST-7341, 1964) U.S. #129\nIn Person (Liberty LRP-3386/LST-7386, 1964); recorded live at The Cellar Door\nThe Bud & Travis Latin Album (Liberty LRP-3398/LST-7398, 1965); reissued on Folk Era 1471 in 2004\nBud & Travis (Sunset SUM 1154/SUS 5154, 1968); compilation album\nCloudy Summer Afternoon (Liberty LN 10213, 1984); compilation album\nThe Best of Bud & Travis (Collectors' Choice Music CCM-065-2, 1996); compilation album\nThe Santa Monica Concert (Folk Era 1465, 2003); includes tracks from In Concert and In Concert, Volume 2\nFrom the Ridiculous to the Sublime (Travis Edmonson Collection #21, 2008); compilation album\nBud Dashiell and the Kinsmen\n\nFolk Music in a Contemporary Manner (Warner W/WS-1429, 1961); with Carson Parks and Bernie Armstrong (formerly The Steeltown Two); reissued on CD in 2010 on Tartare TTR 80012\nSing Everybody's Hits (Warner Bros.

    "text": "Sparkadia was an Australian rock band, formed in Sydney in 2004. They were originally known as The Spark. The band was formed by Alexander Burnett (vocals, guitar) and Dave Hall (drums), and eventually expanded with the addition of Nick Rabone (bass) and Josephine Ayling (keyboards, guitar, vocals) in 2006. In 2008 Ayling was replaced by Tiffany Preece on guitars and vocals. By 2009 Sparkadia was Burnett's solo project. Sparkadia released two studio albums, Postcards (31 May 2008) and The Great Impression (18 March 2011).\n\n\n== Band history ==\n\n\n=== 2004–2007: Formation and Things Behind the Sun ===\nSparkadia formed as a duo in 2004 in Sydney by Alexander Burnett on lead vocals and David Hall on drums.\nOn 17 February 2007 Sparkadia released their debut extended play titled, Things Behind the Sun, on Boundary Sounds through Inertia Records, which peaked in the ARIA Singles Chart top 100 for four weeks in March–April. \nIn 2007, Sparkadia supported Elbow on their tour of Australia following the release of the Things Behind the Sun EP. This was followed by a tour of the UK that included supporting Irish band The Thrills, whom they were to support again the following year on their Australian tour.\n\n\n=== 2008–2009: Postcards ===\nIn May 2008, the band released \"Too Much to Do\", the second single from their debut studio album. \"Too Much to Do\" reached No. 11 on the ARIA Hitseekers Singles Chart. \nTheir first studio album, Postcards, was released on 31 May 2008  and reached number 23 in the ARIA Albums Chart. For the album the line-up were Ayling, Burnett, Hall and Rabone. Soon after Ayling was replaced by Tiffany Preece on guitars and vocals. However, by 2009 Sparkadia had become Burnett's solo project; according to Burnett: Hall had \"moved onto other things\", Preece had left to have a baby, and Rabone went to India.\nIn 2008, Sparkadia toured with Jimmy Eat World on their European tour.\n This was followed by shows with Vampire Weekend, as well as their own headline shows across the UK and Europe.\nIn 2009, the band recorded a cover of \"This Boy's in Love\" by The Presets for Triple J's Like a Version Volume 5.\nIn 2009, Sparkadia toured Australia as part of the Big Day Out, before embarking on a string of sold-out shows across Australia before amicably parting ways as a four piece.\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: The Great Impression ===\nIn September 2010 Sparkadia issued the next single, \"Talking Like I'm Falling Down Stairs\", which peaked in the top 100. Another single, \"China\", was issued in March 2011. Burnett, as Sparkadia, had moved to London to work on the second album in mid-January 2010. \nThe Great Impression was issued on 18 March 2011, which reached number 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart. On 20 March it was the week's \"feature album\" on national youth radio Triple J.\nIn March 2011,  Burnett was the featured cover star for Sydney music magazine The Drum, with the tagline \"Sparkadia I'll Do It Myself\". The feature photo shoot was conducted by award winning music photographer Daniel Boud.\n\n\n=== 2012–present: Solo work ===\nFollowing Sparkadia's The Great Impression,  Burnett joined the Nick Cave Straight To You concert series organised by Triple J. He performed on many of the songs on the tour including his own rendition of The Boys Next Door's \"Shivers\", and the duet \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\" with Lanie Lane. The subsequent live recording/DVD went on to win an ARIA Award at the ARIA Music Awards of 2012.\nFrom December 2012, Burnett has largely worked as a songwriter. He has collaborated and co-written tracks for various artists including DJ Snake, Alison Wonderland, Kaiser Chiefs, Digitalism, George Maple, Flight Facilities,  Elizabeth Rose, Dan Sultan, Thelma Plum, Tieks, LDRU, Rationale and more.\nBurnett also had a deep house project called Antony & Cleopatra, which was based in London. It is a duo with Anita Blay (AKA CocknBullKid), whom Burnett met in London in 2014 during a pop writing session. In 2016, Burnett claimed to be working on the third Sparkadia album. As of August 2024, however, no further updates have been given regarding the project.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAlexander Burnett – lead vocals, guitar, keyboards (2004–present)\nDavid Hall – drums (2004–2009)\nJosephine Ayling – guitar, keyboards, vocals (2006–2008)\nNick Rabone – bass guitar (2006–2009)\nTiffany Preece – guitars, vocals (2008–2009)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Single ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Sparkadia website\nOfficial Alexander Burnett website\nOfficial Antony & Cleopatra website\nSparkadia Discography at Discogs\nSparkadia Discography at AllMusic\nInterview with Iain Shedden at The Australian"

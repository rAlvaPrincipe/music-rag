Project.\nOn November 5, 2014, Country Musume was rebooted and renamed Country Girls (カントリー・ガールズ, Kantorī Gāruzu) with new members.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Country Musume era ===\nCountry Musume was formed in 1999 and was termed as \"Country Girls from Hokkaidō.\" The initial group consisted of native members of Hokkaidō, Rinne Toda, Azusa Kobayashi, and Hiromi Yanagihara.\nBefore the release of their first single in July 1999, Hiromi Yanagihara died in a car accident. After the accident, Azusa Kobayashi departed from the group and Rinne Toda carried on as a solo artist and released two singles under the \"Country Musume\" name by herself. In the summer of 2000, Asami Kimura joined the group and the duo released one more single.\nTheir popularity rose when Morning Musume's Rika Ishikawa—who is from Kanagawa—was lent to the group in April 2001. Country Musume had their first charting single in Japan with the release of \"Hajimete no Happy Birthday.\" The trio, under the name \"Country Musume ni Rika Ishikawa,\" released two singles and an album. Early in 2002, Mai Satoda was recruited to the group, although she initially auditioned to be a Morning Musume member.\nThe quartet released one single before Toda, the remaining original member bid farewell at the end of 2002. Afterwards, Kimura, Ishikawa, and Satoda released one more single.\nIn mid-2003, Country Musume had a major shift in its roster. Miuna Saito, who is from Shizuoka, was recruited to the group. Instead of Rika Ishikawa, the group featured Asami Konno and Miki Fujimoto, who are both Morning Musume and Hokkaidō natives. In this new formation (named \"Country Musume ni Konno to Fujimoto\"), the quintet has released three singles. In 2004, Country Musume (except the featured singers) participated in the fifth edition of Hello! Project's Folk Song series, where various H!P artists sang covers of Japanese and Western folk songs.\nAsami Kimura and Miuna Saito graduated from Country Musume and Hello! Project on its 10th anniversary concert on January 28, 2007, leaving Satoda as the only remaining member.\n\n\n=== Country Girls era ===\nOn February 11, 2014, it was announced during the Hello!

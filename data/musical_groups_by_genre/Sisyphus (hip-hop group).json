    "text": "Sisyphus (formerly S / S / S) is a collaborative project between Serengeti,  Ryan Lott (under the moniker Son Lux) and Sufjan Stevens.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe trio released their debut EP, Beak & Claw, on Anticon in 2012. It features vocal contributions from Shara Worden and Doseone. In 2013 the trio changed their name to Sisyphus. In an interview, Stevens said, \"S/S/S started to sound like the Nazi Schutzstaffel with a lisp, so we had to change it.\" The name is inspired in part by the art of Jim Hodges, whose work is featured on the cover of their self-titled debut full-length album, which was released on March 18, 2014. Stevens says the \"gold and metallic boulders Jim made were an obvious influence on our name change\"â€”a reference to four steel-clad boulders installed at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Sisyphus performed at opening of Hodges' retrospective at the Walker on February 14, 2014.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBeak & Claw EP (Anticon, 2012)\nSisyphus (Asthmatic Kitty/Joyful Noise, 2014)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBeak & Claw on Bandcamp\nSisyphus on Bandcamp"

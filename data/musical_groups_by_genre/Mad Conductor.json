    "text": "Mad Conductor is an experimental hip hop band fronted by MC Devlin (Chris Tray) and with production by MC Kinney (Dan McKinney).  Their sound mixes hip-hop with a wide array of styles, in a unique and often experimental way.\nThe band formed in 2005 after Devlin's former band, hardcore outfit No Cash, broke up.  Originally from Center Valley, Pennsylvania, the band relocated to New Orleans in 2008.\nIn 2012 the band successfully raised funds on Kickstarter to record a full-length album titled MC Rises.\nThey are currently back in Pennsylvania, recording and releasing new music on a regular basis while keeping up with ongoing gigs in the north east.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nMechanical Claw EP (2005)\nRenegade Space Rock (2007)\nMembers Only EP (2008)\nCentral America EP (2010)\nMC Rises (2013)\nSpace Rock Steady EP (2015)\n\n\n== References =="

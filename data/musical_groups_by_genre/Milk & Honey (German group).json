Both songs entered the German charts.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter leaving her previous group, the pop quintet Preluders, in 2005, Anne Ross was introduced by Jörn-Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen to Manel Filali, and so they formed the duo Milk & Honey. They signed with Warner Music Group in 2006 and released the single \"Habibi (Je t'aime)\"; produced by Bülent Aris and Felix Schönewald, it mixes traditional pop music aspects with elements of oriental music.\nIn 2007 the duo reached higher prominence after performing at the reality show Popstars and in the German version of Come Dine with Me (entitled Das perfekte Dinner). In the same year, they released another single, \"Didi\", (English version of Didi); a music video for it premiered at VIVA Germany on 17 August 2007.\nIn 2008 the duo released their first (and so far only) studio album, Elbi, through Warner Music Group.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Butterfingers are an Australian rap rock group from Brisbane, Queensland. Most of their releases are on their own label, Valley Trash Records. They are currently signed to New World Artists.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was formed when lead vocalist 'Evil' Eddie Mark Jacobson booked himself in for a gig at The Zoo, a bar in Brisbane, without a band or any intentions of performing solo. The venue held Jacobson's booking to him, and a backing band was assembled featuring DJ/percussionist Olly Thomas, bassist Dave Crane, and drummer Damien Green.\nTheir first two singles \"Everytime\" and \"I Love Work\", reached No. 38 and No. 15 respectively in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2003.\nTheir next single \"Yo Mama\" also receiving airplay on Triple J with the group's debut album, Breakfast at Fatboys, on its national release, 3 May 2004, awarded Triple J 'Album of the Week'.  The album debuted at No. 15 on the ARIA Album charts and was also nominated for the 'Best Independent Release' at the 2004 ARIA Music Awards \"Yo Mama\" charted at No. 17 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2004. In October 2004 Butterfingers scored a Guest Programming spot on rage.\nIn March 2005 Butterfingers aligned themselves with Festival Mushroom Records through a licensing deal between FMR and Valley Trash, the bands in-house label.  Their first (and last) co-release was in June 2005 with the release of the single, \"Figjam (Fuck I'm Good, Just Ask Me)\". The song peaked at No. 50 and in October 2005, \"Figjam\" was nominated for 'Best Urban Release' at the 2005 ARIA Music Awards. \"Figjam\" and the preceding single, \"Jesus I Was Evil\" (a Darcy Clay cover) charted at No. 11 and No. 69 respectively in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2005.\nThe band released a new album, The Deeper You Dig... on 27 May 2006, which peaked at No. 14 on the album chart. A single from the album, \"Get Up Outta the Dirt\", was released on 3 June 2006. The single peaked at No. 36, and charted at No. 83 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2006.\nIn June 2007 the band won an APRA award - 'Most Performed Urban Work' for \"Get Up Outta the Dirt\". The group then released \"Nothin Much Happens\" as a single in October 2007, which landed on Triple J's \"hit list\" of songs receiving medium to high rotation. A music video was produced for this song and was played on jtv, and on rage, and also Video Hits.\nWith the band on a presumed hiatus, lead vocalist Eddie Jacobson began performing with Brisbane-based punk band, SpitFireLiar. Jacobson also went on to a solo single under the name Evil Eddie, entitled \"Queensland\".\n\nTo be honest, I’m really gonna focus on the solo thing as much as possible, the other things are all collaborative; the solo thing is gonna be similar to what Butterfingers has previously sounded like. I was submitting a lot of the music for Butterfingers, I haven’t finished it all yet.\nJacobson's debut solo album, Welcome to Flavour Country, was released in November 2012.\nButterfingers announced their reformation, alongside releasing a new single \"Big Night Out,\" in March 2017.\nThey then went on tour to celebrate the 15-year anniversary of Breakfast at Fatboys in 2019, supported by Fresh Violet.\nThe band released a new album, Bad News, in April 2020.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\n\"Evil Eddie\" Jacobson − lead vocals, guitar, samples (2001–2009, 2017–present)\nOlly Thomas − keyboards, percussion, samples, turntables, backing vocals (2001–2009, 2017–present)\nTony McCall − drums, backing vocals (2017–present)\nFormer members\nDave Crane – bass guitar (2001–2009)\nDamien Green − drums (2001–2009)\nBrad \"Bradzilla\" Cochrane − bass guitar (2017–2021)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== ARIA Awards ===\nThe ARIA Music Awards are presented annually since 1987 by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).\n\n\n=== APRA Awards ===\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site"

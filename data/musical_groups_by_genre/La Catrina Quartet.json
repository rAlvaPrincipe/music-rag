    "text": "The La Catrina Quartet is a group of four U.S.-based classical musicians who specialize in traditional and classical music from the Americas as well as traditional European pieces. The group was formed in 2001 by four graduate students at the Western Michigan University. The group tours regularly through the United States and Mexico, with about 50 performances per year at venues such as New Museum of Musical Instruments in Phoenix, the Symphony Space in New York and the Festival Internacional Cervantino. The quartet has collaborated with orchestras, composers and others to create new compositions, and record pieces by Latin American artists. In 2012, the group won a Latin Grammy for Best Classical Recording with Brasilero. It has also won the Research and Creative Scholarship Prize from the Western Michigan University and the Creative Scholarship and Arts Council Award of North Carolina.\n\n\n== Repertoire and work ==\nNamed after the famous skeletal figure created by Mexican cartoonist José Guadalupe Posada, La Catrina's work is characterized by the blend of Latin American traditional and classical pieces along with traditional European ones, averaging about fifty concerts per year, mostly in the United States and Mexico in venues such as the University of Washington in Seattle, at the New Museum of Musical Instruments in Phoenix, the Symphony Space in New York, Utah State University, the Mexican Embassy in Washington DC Festival de Música de Cámera in Morelia and the Festival Internacional Cervantino.

    "text": "The Puppini Sisters is an English close harmony vocal trio composed of Italian-born singer Marcella Puppini and English singers Kate Mullins and Emma Smith. Although the three are not related, the name was chosen in tribute to the Andrews Sisters. They are known for providing guest vocals on Michael Bublé's cover of \"Jingle Bells\". Puppini first studied fashion design at Saint Martins School of Art, and later music at Trinity College of Music in London where she met Mullins and original member Rosanna Schura, who was later replaced by Stephanie O'Brien. After eight years with the group, O'Brien was replaced by Emma Smith. The trio are backed by a three-piece band featuring Martin Kolarides on guitar, Henrik Jensen on double bass and Peter Ibbetson on drums. The group is associated with a burlesque revival.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe group was founded in 2004 by Marcella Puppini after she was inspired by the animated film The Triplets of Belleville (Les Triplettes de Belleville) (2003). In 2005, they were signed by UCJ (Universal Classics and Jazz). The Puppini Sisters' debut single, \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\", was a cover of the hit single by The Andrews Sisters. The group's second album, The Rise and Fall of Ruby Woo includes original compositions by Puppini, Stephanie O'Brien and Kate Mullins. The trio's albums often include contemporary songs reimagined in the Andrews Sisters style (for example, The Bangles' \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" on their Ruby Woo album). \nThe Puppini Sisters' television appearances include This Morning, Loose Women, The Alan Titchmarsh Show, Big Brother's Little Brother, Hell's Kitchen, CBeebies' Space Pirates, The View (on ABC), and 2011's A Michael Bublé Christmas on NBC and Graham Norton with Bublé in 2012. The group appeared in the 2009 Jonathan Creek New Year's special The Grinning Man, performing their 2007 single \"Spooky\" and has been featured on the soundtracks for the US TV series Grey's Anatomy and Chuck. In 2015 the Sisters appeared on BBC1's Strictly Come Dancing.\nThe group performed at Glastonbury Festival 2009 on 27 June as well as performing at Goodwood Vintage Festival on 15 August.\nOn 27 June 2012, O'Brien announced via the group's Facebook page that she was leaving the group. It was later revealed that Terrianne Passingham would replace O'Brien. However, Passingham also left the group and shortly thereafter Emma Smith took her place. The singer made her debut with The Puppini Sisters on The Graham Norton Show in November 2012.\nThe trio started a Pledge Music campaign to crowd fund their new album (along with an optional bonus edition of remixes) with the help of fans. The album was finalised before Christmas 2015 and it was released in March 2016 (Those who donated money to the creation of the album were able to receive the album digitally on 25 February and The Deluxe remix edition on 7 June).\nFrom March 2016, the trio embarked on a tour to promote the album across many areas in the country and internationally finishing off in London at O2 Islington Academy. For four dates of the tour, Smith was absent so original member Rosanna Schura filled in for those dates.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nAccording to Marcella Puppini, the group sings about modern and risqué subjects in a quaintly old-fashioned way. This comes from their interest in 1940s songs such as \"Hold Tight (Want Some Seafood Mama)\" that have sexual undertones despite their overtly innocent lyrics.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe Puppini Sisters won a Gold Disc for international sales of their first CD, Betcha Bottom Dollar, in 2007.\nThe Puppini Sisters website won the 2008 Cream of Yorkshire awards \"Gold Award\" for best website. The digital advertising agency twentysix won the top award the \"overall Grand Prix award\" for its design of a website for Universal Music showcasing the group.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nBetcha Bottom Dollar (31 July 2006 UK; 1 May 2007 US; March 2008 France) – according to the official website the album reached number two on the US Jazz charts and number nine on the US new artist chart\nThe Rise and Fall of Ruby Woo (1 October 2007 UK; February 2008 US; January 2009 France) – featuring classic covers, 1940s style reworkings of contemporary music, and a selection of original compositions.

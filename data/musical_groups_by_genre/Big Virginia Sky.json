The group is described as playing a mix of Americana and traditional instrumental tunes. When playing Bluegrass music, the group uses a full drum-kit and other world percussion, which is often frowned upon by enthusiasts as it is a non-traditional method. The group’s debut album was released in Fall, 2015 after a successful crowdfunding campaign. The album features original songs  written by the band as well as those co-written with singer-songwriters such as Tanya Gallagher (Love Song) and Logan Vath (Whiskey and Long Talks). The album release concert tour was sponsored by The Vinyl Music Hall in Pensacola, FL and listed on Bluegrass Unlimited.\nBig Virginia Sky features singer-songwriter and lead vocalist, Cole Clark-sponsored guitar player, James Adkins, with an addition from award-winning vocalist and mandolin player, Scott Slay.

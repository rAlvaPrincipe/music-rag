    "text": "Youmou to Ohana (Japanese 羊毛とおはな) were a Japanese acoustic music duo produced by LD&K Records. \nThe duo were guitarist \"Wool\" Youmou (real name Kazunori Ichikawa, born 26 July 1981) and singer \"Flower\" Ohana (real name Hana Chiba, 31 January 1979 - 8 April 2015).  Their first album in 2007 was sold at Nagoya's Village Vanguard. Following the Great East Japan earthquake Youmou and Ohana’s song ‘Fuyu no Uta’ was used in a TV commercial in Taiwan as a thank-you message by Interchange Association Japan (IAJ) for Taiwan's support after the earthquake. This led to a concert in Taipei.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n== References =="

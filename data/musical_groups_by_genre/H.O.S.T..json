    "text": "H.O.S.T. was an influential Azerbaijani hip hop group, based in Baku.\nThe group's name derives from abbreviations of the classical elements in Azerbaijani language, which means hava (air), od (fire), su (water) and torpaq (earth). \nThe group was active for five years and released seven studio albums. The group disbanded in 2012, after each member went down his own path, though some have briefly worked together.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nProloq (2007)\nQarada Qırmızı (2008)\nQısa Qapanma (2009)\nEP v.01 (2009)\nBiz İnsan Deyilik (2010)\n14 (2011)\nİşıq (2011)\n\n\n== References =="

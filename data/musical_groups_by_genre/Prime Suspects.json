    "text": "Prime Suspects was an American rap group from the 3rd Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana. The group was composed of Glock, New-9 & Uzi, that was signed to Master P's No Limit Records. The group appeared on many of No Limit's releases including Master P's Ghetto D and Magic's Sky's the Limit, among others. They released their debut album in late 1998 entitled, Guilty Til Proven Innocent, but it failed to live up to the success of some of No Limit's other albums, peaking at only #36 on the Billboard 200. The group disbanded shortly after (New-9 was a part of TRU Records during 2000-2002).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n=== As lead artist ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nNo Limit Records\nNo Limit Records discography\nBeats by the Pound\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Christian Victor Noel Hope Hely-Hutchinson (26 December 1901 –  11 March 1947) was a British composer, conductor, pianist and music administrator. He is best known for the Carol Symphony and for humorous song-settings.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHely-Hutchinson was born in Cape Town, Cape Colony (now Cape Town, South Africa). His parents were Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor of Cape Colony from 1901 to 1910 during and after the Boer War, and May Hely-Hutchinson. He initially lived in Kent, then moved back to South Africa in 1907. He was taught the piano by Dr Thomas Barrow Dowling (1861–1926), the organist of Cape Town cathedral. Victor was a child prodigy, composing many pieces before the age of ten – his parents had a collection of sketches for violin and piano published as A Child's Thoughts in 1909. \nIn England in 1910, he was taught piano by Donald Tovey and was initially educated at Heatherdown School, near Ascot in Berkshire. In 1914, his father died. Victor was then educated at Eton College, and then read history at Balliol College, Oxford. Music, however, prevailed and after one year at Oxford he was granted permission to study for a Mus. Bac. at the Royal College of Music, where he studied conducting under Adrian Boult. In 1922, he returned to Cape Town to teach at the South African College of Music, which was later incorporated into the University of Cape Town.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nHe joined the BBC at Savoy Hill in 1926, becoming a conductor, pianist, and accompanist. He moved to Hampstead, where his two sons were born. In 1933, he moved once again to Birmingham to become Midland Regional Director of Music for the BBC, where he formed and conducted the Midland Studio Orchestra. In 1934, he left the BBC to become Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham, taking over from Sir Granville Bantock. \nIn 1938, he saw signs of war, and relocated his family out of Birmingham to a nearby village. During the war he became an ARP warden. He became a D.Mus from Oxford University in 1941. He also joined the university's officer cadet force. In 1944, he returned to the BBC to become overall Director of Music, succeeding Arthur Bliss. He moved to St John's Wood. He never purchased a car, always using his bicycle.\nThe winter of 1947 was very long-lasting and to save fuel (which was still rationed), Hely-Hutchinson refused to switch on the radiators in his office. He developed a cold, which became pneumonia.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHe died on 11 March 1947 at the premature age of 45. His wife Marjorie died in 1988. Astra Desmond sang at his memorial service.\n\n\n== Works ==\nAlthough mostly forgotten now, Hely-Hutchinson's orchestral music enjoyed some popularity during his lifetime, including the Overture to a Pantomime, and the substantial Variations, Intermezzo and Finale, (described by the composer as a set of symphonic variations) premiered at the Proms in 1927. The Young Idea, a lighter, jazz-influenced rhapsody for piano and orchestra, was also played at the Proms in 1930 and was recorded in 2008 with the BBC Concert Orchestra and David Owen Norris as soloist. A Symphony for small orchestra, using music reworked from some of his film scores, was heard posthumously at the Proms in 1947.\nBy far his best known work is the Carol Symphony written in 1927. The four movements - really chorale preludes rather than symphonic movements - are based on the traditional English Christmas carols: \n\nO Come, All Ye Faithful\nGod Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\nThe Coventry Carol and The First Nowell\nHere We Come A-wassailing\nThe third movement was used for the title music of the 1943 Children's Hour and 1984 BBC children's television adaptation of John Masefield's The Box of Delights, in particular the variation on the theme of The First Nowell.\nHe remains well known for his settings of various nursery rhymes and children's poems. His setting of \"Old Mother Hubbard\" is arranged in the manner of Handel. His song setting of Edward Lear's \"The Owl and the Pussycat\" was notably recorded in 1955 by Elton Hayes and featured regularly on the BBC's Children's Favourites radio show.\n\n\n=== Songs ===\nWith texts by William Blake\n\nFive Songs of Innocence\nPiping down the valleys wild\nThe Lamb\nInfant Joy\nSpring\nThe Little Boy Lost\nThe Echoing Green and Other Songs\nThe Echoing Green\nThe Shepherd\nLaughing Song\nHoly Thursday\nThe Blossom\nA Cradle Song\nWith texts by Edward Lear\n\nThree Nonsense Songs\nThe Owl and the Pussy-cat\nThe Table and the Chair\nThe Duck and the Kangaroo\nWith texts by Harry Graham\n\nTwenty-one songs from \"Ruthless Rhymes for Heartless Homes\" (1945)\nMore Ruthless Rhymes for Heartless Homes (1946)\nWith texts by Walter de la Mare\n\nThree Songs from \"Peacock Pie\"\nThe cupboard\nThe window\nThe little old Cupid\nSong of a Soldier (1933)\n\n\n=== Orchestral ===\nThree Fugal Fancies, for strings (1925)\nCarol Symphony (1927)\nVariations, Intermezzo and Finale for orchestra (1927)\nThe Young Idea: Rhapsody for piano and orchestra (1930)\nOverture to a Pantomime (1938)\nSymphony for Small Orchestra (1942)\nSolemn Prelude, in G\nSouth African Suite\n\n\n=== Dramatic ===\nHearts are Trumps (Operetta) (1932)\nThe Unveiling (Nativity play) (1932)\nMuch incidental music for plays, theatre and radio\n\n\n=== Chamber ===\nPiano Quintet\nPiano Sonata\nString Quartet\nViola Sonata\nViolin Sonata\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJürgen Schaarwächter, Two Centuries of British Symphonism: From the beginnings to 1945.

    "text": "Brown Rice and Kerosine is the third album by Australian folk-rock group Redgum. The title is taken from the first track, and the album was released around the time Redgum changed from a part-time band to a full-time job for its members.\n\"100 Years On\" was released as a single. As noted on a sticker on the cover, the song \"Liberal Values\" was to have been included on the album but was removed for legal reasons. It was a parody of Bacharach/David's \"(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance\". In April 2019, a recording of a live performance of \"Liberal Values\" from 1980 was uploaded to YouTube.\nIt was originally released as a record and was very briefly available on CD in the late 80s. Some tracks were included on the 2004 collection Against the Grain.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nSide A\n\"100 Years On\" (J. Schumann)\n\"Lear Jets Over Kulgera\" (M.

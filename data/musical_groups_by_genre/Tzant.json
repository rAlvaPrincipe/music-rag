Their debut \"Hot and Wet (Believe It)\", featuring Verna Francis, made number 36 on the UK Singles Chart during September 1996, and two further singles (\"Sounds of Wickedness\", their most successful single, and \"Bounce with the Massive\") would make the top 40 in 1998. Tzant's first two releases also found moderate success on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart.\nThe group consisted of Jamie White, Marcus Thomas (a.k.a. ODC MC, formerly of Clock) and Moussa Clarke, who also released records under the names of Mirrorball, PF Project featuring Ewan McGregor, and Musique vs U2. PF Project mixed the first Euphoria compilation album, which peaked at number 1 in the UK compilation chart in 1999. In 2008, Marcus Thomas co-penned Roebeck's underground hit \"Just Wanna Be Loved\", from the album Hurricanes on Venus, alongside composer Luke Corradine.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Tzant singles ===\n\n\n=== PF Project singles ===\n\n\n=== PF Project albums ===\n\n\n=== Mirrorball singles ===\n\n\n=== Musique vs U2 singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

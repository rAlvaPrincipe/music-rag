    "text": "Charalambides is an avant-garde musical group originally from Houston, Texas, United States and lately of Austin, Texas. They were formed in 1991 under the short-lived name Mutual Admiration Society by Tom Carter, Christina Carter and Kyle Silfer, and later members have since included Jason Bill and Heather Leigh Murray. The band has long considered itself primarily a duo between Tom and Christina Carter. Their music contains elements typical of psychedelic music such as reverb, backwards recording, extended instrumental jamming and the use of found sounds, which led to them being described as part of the New Weird America movement. In addition to several major releases on labels such as Kranky, Eclipse Records, and Time-Lag Records, they have also released many small edition CD-Rs on their own Wholly Other label, and other small independent labels, some of which have later been re-issued (Our Bed is Green, and Historic Sixth Ward for example).\nTheir name derives from the surname of a customer at the record shop where core members Tom Carter and Christina Carter met, who are divorced but remain together as a musical unit. They have also released albums on Kranky and Eclipse Records under their own names, as well as several small edition CD-Rs. In addition, the two have collaborated with numerous other musicians such as Loren Mazzacane Connors, Yellow Swans and Robert Horton.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\n\n\n=== Primary album releases on Siltbreeze and Kranky ===\nOur Bed Is Green CS-100 (No Label, 1993) Reissued as 2CD on Kranky, 2005\nUnion LP (Siltbreeze, 1993)\nMarket Square 2LP (Siltbreeze, 1995)\nHouston CD (Siltbreeze, 1998)\nUnknown Spin CD (Kranky, 2003)\nJoy Shapes LP/CD (Kranky, 2004)\nA Vintage Burden (Kranky, 2006)\nLikeness  CD (Kranky, 2007)\nExile  LP/CD (Kranky, 2011)\nTom and Christina Carter  LP/CS (Drawing Room, 2018)\n\n\n=== Limited edition album releases, self-released, CD-R's ===\nHistoric 6th Ward CS-90 (No Label, 1994) (Reissued as CD on (Wholly Other, 1996 and 2 LP on (Time-Lag Records, 2002)\nInternal Eternal CD (Wholly Other, 1999)\nSticks CD-R (Wholly Other, 2000)\nBranches Lathe LP (Eclipse Records, 2001) Edition of 100 copies\nYIH CD-R (Carbon Records, 2001) Limited to 100 copies\nUntitled split CD-R (with Scorces) (Wholly Other, 2002) (Charalambides side reissued as Unknown Spin on Kranky, 2003)\nBeing As Is CD-R (Crucial Blast, 2002) Limited edition of 100 copies\nCHT CD-R (Wholly Other, 2002) Limited edition CDr, 200 copies.\nIN CR EA SE 2LP (Eclipse Records, 2002)\nEmerald Message CD-R (Wholly Other, 2006) Recorded in Houston, 12/23/95 except for 4 recorded 12/22/95 as part of the _Internal Eternal_ sessions\nGlowing Raw CD-R (Wholly Other, 2006) limited edition of 250 copies.

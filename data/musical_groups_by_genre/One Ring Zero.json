    "text": "One Ring Zero is a modern music group led by Joshua Camp and Michael Hearst that melds many genres and sounds to create a unique type of music.\n\n\n== Instruments ==\nHearst plays the theremin and guitar, and Camp plays the accordion and piano. They both play the claviola and prove to be extremely versatile musicians, often switching instruments for each song. Other instruments include a toy piano, a melodica, a metallophone, jones-O-phone, cajón and a series of everyday sounds looped and altered to create textures and rhythms. Using all these instruments (or noises) together One Ring Zero creates a sound that defies genre. There is an undeniable klezmer influence throughout their music but also a modern rock or indie influence. The band has been denoted \"Lit Rock\" by the media but they seem to defy any singular name. Both Hearst and Camp sing, Hearst bass and Camp tenor. They often perform as a five-piece band, including trumpet, drum kit, and bass guitar.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nOne Ring Zero on NPR's \"Fresh Air\" (2004).[1]\nOne Ring Zero on A&E Television's \"Breakfast with the Arts\" (2007).\nOne Ring Zero's on NPR's \"Morning Edition\" (2007).[2]\nOne Ring Zero has also performed at music venues and cultural institutions including the Whitney Museum of Art, Central Park SummerStage, The Kennedy Center, Toronto’s Harbourfront Centre, Spring Scream in Taiwan, Era in Tokyo, New Morning in Paris, The Chicago World Music Festival, and the Fundación Príncipe de Asturias in Spain.\n\n\n== As Smart As We Are (aka The Author Project) ==\nOn their critically acclaimed album \"As Smart As We Are\", published authors and writers wrote lyrics on request, which Hearst and Camp then set to music. Some writers wrote basic chord progressions or requested a certain genre for their song to fall under but for the most part Michael and Joshua wrote their own music for the lyrics.\nTrack list and contributing author.\n\n1. \"Introduction\"\n2. \"Natty Man Blues\" - lyrics by Paul Auster\n3. \"Radio\" - lyrics by Daniel Handler\n4. \"We Both Have A Feeling You Still Want Me\" - lyrics by Darin Strauss\n5. \"Kiss Me, You Brat\" - lyrics by Rick Moody - vocals by Allyssa Lamb\n6. \"Deposition Disposition\" - lyrics by Lawrence Krauser\n7. \"Half And Half\" - lyrics by Clay McLeod Chapman - vocals by Hanna Cheek\n8. \"The Ghost Of Rita Gonzolo\" - lyrics by Dave Eggers\n9. \"Frankenstein Monster Song\" - lyrics by Margaret Atwood\n10. \"Honku\" - lyrics by Aaron Naparstek\n11. \"Blessing\" - lyrics by Denis Johnson\n12. \"On The Wall\" - lyrics by Neil Gaiman\n13. \"All About House Plants\" - lyrics by Amy Fusselman\n14. \"Golem\" - lyrics by Myla Goldberg - vocals by Syd Straw\n15. \"Snow\" - lyrics by A.M.

The recipes are sung word for word, as song lyrics, and as an added bonus, the band asked each chef what kind of genre of music they would prefer their recipe be sung as. Edible Brooklyn called the CD \"A feast for the ears.\" Time (magazine) wrote \"Every once in a while you come across a project and think, I can’t believe no one has done this before.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nOne Ring Zero \"Tranz Party” (1999) (Planetary Records)\nOne Ring Zero \"Alice” (2001) (Urban Geek Records)\nOne Ring Zero \"Interludes and Out-takes from The Pumpkin Pie Show” (2001) (Urban Geek Records)\nOne Ring Zero \"Memorandum” (2002) (Urban Geek Records)\nOne Ring Zero \"As Smart As We Are” (2004) (Soft Skull Press)\nOne Ring Zero and Rick Moody (2004) (Isota Records)\nOne Ring Zero \"New York Spleen” French Edition (2005) (Naïve Records)\nSophie Auster (2005) (Actes Sud / Naïve Records)\nOne Ring Zero  \"As Smart As We Are” Deluxe Edition with DVD (2006) (Barbes Records)\nOne Ring Zero \"Wake Them Up” (2006) (Barbes Records)\nOne Ring Zero \"Wake Them Up\" Japanese Edition (2007) (MoorWorks)\nOne Ring Zero \"Live at Barbes\" (2008) (Barbes Records)\nOne Ring Zero “Ten Years Of Extra Stuff” (2009) (Urban Geek Records)\nOne Ring Zero \"Planets\" (2010) (Urban Geek Records)\nOne Ring Zero \"Planets\" Japanese Edition (2010) (MoorWorks)\nOne Ring Zero \"As Smart As We Are\" Japanese Edition (2010) (MoorWorks)\nOne Ring Zero \"The Recipe Project\" (2011) (Black Balloon)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nOne Ring Zero “The Sirens of Red Hot” (2004) (Isota Records)\nOne Ring Zero and Rick Moody (2004) (Isota Records)\n\n\n=== Video ===\nOne Ring Zero “Addendum” (2005) (Urban Geek Records)\nAs the subject of “As Smart As They Are - The Author Project” (2007)\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nA documentary called As Smart As They Are: The Author Project was made about the duo.

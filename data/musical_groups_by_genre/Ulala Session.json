    "text": "Ulala Session (Korean: 울랄라 세션) is a South Korean boy band that rose to fame after winning the 2011 television talent show Superstar K 3. The group currently consists of members Kim Myung-hoon, Park Seung-il, Choi Do-won. The group originally included Lim Yoon-taek, who died from gastric cancer in 2013, and Park Kwang-sun, who left after enlisting in the military in 2015. Choi Do-won and Ha Jun-seok joined the group in 2016.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPrior to their appearance on Superstar K3, the group was not widely known in South Korea, performing \"anywhere, even in the middle of a schoolyard if there was a stage.\"\nDuring Superstar K3, audiences responded particularly fondly to lead singer Lim's battle with stomach cancer. This led to some speculation that Ulala Session was making up the story of Lim's cancer as a way to garner sympathy during the competition; Lim responded in July 2012 by bringing his doctor on SBS's One Night in TV Entertainment to confirm the diagnosis.\nOn 11 February 2013, Lim Yoon-taek, leader of Ulala Session, died from gastric cancer.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Soundtrack appearances ===\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Mirror (stylised as MIRROR) is a Hong Kong Cantopop boy group formed through ViuTV's reality talent show Good Night Show - King Maker in 2018. The group consists of twelve members: Frankie Chan, Alton Wong, Lokman Yeung, Stanley Yau, Anson Kong, Jer Lau, Ian Chan, Anson Lo, Jeremy Lee, Edan Lui, Keung To, and Tiger Yau. They debuted on 3 November 2018 with the single \"In a Second\" (一秒間).\nThe group has won numerous accolades since their debut, including a Metro Radio Hits Music Award for Best Group, an Ultimate Song Chart Award for Group of the Year (Bronze), and Group of the Year (Gold) at the inaugural Chill Club Music Awards held by ViuTV. Mirror is considered one of the driving forces in the renewed interest of the Cantopop genre and to have prompted an unprecedented wave of fandom culture in Hong Kong. Their 2020 single \"Ignited\" won Top Ten Song of the Year at the Ultimate Song Chart Awards and the Chill Club Music Awards. Their 2021 single \"Warrior\" topped the Ultimate 903 Chart for two weeks, the first song from a group to do so in 15 years.\nAll members of Mirror have also debuted individually, most notably Keung To, who won the Ultimate Song Chart Award for My Favourite Male Singer, and Jer Lau, who won the Best Newcomer Gold Award. The members have also participated in various drama series, reality shows, and films, most notably Ossan's Love.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2018: Good Night Show – King Maker and formation ===\nIn July 2018, ViuTV's reality talent competition Good Night Show - King Maker started scouting for potential artistes. 99 male contestants successfully auditioned for the show. Participants performed individually and in groups, with a panel of judges deciding who would advance to the next round. The finale aired live on 14 October 2018, with results decided by a public vote and a judging panel. Keung To won the competition, with Ian in second place, and Lokman in third. Anson Kong, Edan, Jeremy, and Stanley were among the top 10. ViuTV intended to form a boy group with the top 10 finalists and proceeded with contract talks.\n\n\n=== 2018–2020: Debut and career beginnings ===\n\nMirror officially debuted on 3 November 2018 with twelve members, with King Maker's producer, Ahfa Wong as the group's manager. According to the group's leader, Lokman, the name Mirror was chosen because \"members look in the mirror every morning and see their real selves; when there are multiple mirrors, they can reflect infinite images; similarly, with infinite potential, the combination of these unique members would allow for unlimited possibilities.\" During the debut press conference, they performed their debut single \"In a Second\" (Chinese: 一秒間).\nOn 21 December 2018, they held their first live concert 2018 THE FIRST MIRROR LIVE CONCERT at the Kowloonbay International Trade & Exhibition Centre Star Hall. The tickets were sold from 15 November 2018 and all tickets were sold out. During the concert, apart from performing some original songs, they also performed Korean pop songs including \"Love Song\" and \"Trouble Maker\", although they expressed their preference of creating their unique renditions instead of going for a \"K-pop feel\".\nBetween January 2019 and November 2020, the group released five more singles, including \"ASAP\" (2019), \"Broken Mirror\" (破鏡) (2019), first-year anniversary single \"Reflection\" (2019), \"Ignited\" (2020) and \"One and All\" (2020). \"Ignited\" won two awards at Hong Kong's major year-end music awards shows, including the Ultimate Song Chart Awards and the inaugural Chill Club Awards. \nMembers also began to make their solo debuts, with Ian and Keung To in 2019, and Anson Kong, Anson Lo, and Jer in 2020. \n\n\n=== 2021–2022: Rising popularity and commercial success ===\nOn 20 January 2021, the group released their debut studio album, One and All, comprising six group singles and fifteen solo songs released by the members in 2020.

The postponed concert was eventually announced to be held from 6 to 8 May 2021, titled MIRROR \"ONE AND ALL\" LIVE 2021, at Kowloon Bay International Trade & Exhibition Centre - Star Hall. It was planned to be held at 50% capacity due to the social distancing policy at the time but was increased to 75% capacity after two weeks following government guidelines.

Li suffered serious damage to his nerves and remains in hospital, but his condition has improved over time. The accident also left a second backup dancer injured, Chang Tsz-fung, who had injuries to his pelvis and cervical spine. The concert was immediately halted and organisers announced the cancellation of remaining concerts. Safety concerns had already been raised early on after dancer, Zisac Law Tak-chi, was reportedly injured during rehearsal, and member of Mirror, Frankie Chan, fell off stage two days prior to the accident. \nThe HKSAR Government set up a task force to look into the matter. The Leisure and Cultural Services Department released the investigation report in November 2022.\n\n\n==== Comeback ====\nOn 10 October 2022, Mirror released the new single, \"We All Are\", marking their comeback after a two-month hiatus.

They are credited for reviving the Cantopop genre, which had been slowly declining since the 2000s. Mirror's appeal in Hong Kong transcends demographics, and the group is regarded as a \"symbol of hope\" in a city struggling with political upheaval and the COVID-19 pandemic. Luisa Tam from the South China Morning Post described Mirror as \"the latest icon to represent Hong Kong pride\", which the city has not seen since the deaths of Cantopop icons Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui in 2003. New York Times reported that there were faces of the group members on \"ads for everything\". A tongue-in-cheek Facebook group called \"My Wife Married Mirror and Left My Marriage In Ruins\" gained 300,000 members, more than double the followers count on the official Facebook page. In 2022, Mirror was listed on Tatler Asia's Most Influential. In 2024, Mirror was featured on the \"Future 25\" List by Rolling Stone.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMIRROR on Instagram"

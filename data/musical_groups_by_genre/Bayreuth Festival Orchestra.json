    "text": "The Bayreuth Festival Orchestra  is a seasonal German orchestra based at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus for the annual summer festival Bayreuth Festival. It is reconstituted each season in order to perform Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen and other of his stage works, as envisaged by the composer and festival founder. The festival occurs annually, although in some years it was cancelled because of war or other reasons.\nAlthough otherwise entirely devoted to the works of Wagner, the inaugural festival in 1876 was opened with a performance of Beethoven's Choral Symphony, and this practice has often been followed subsequently. It has become something of a tradition since Wilhelm Furtwängler reintroduced it in the 1930s.\nThe Bayreuth Festival Orchestra does not have a permanent membership but each year the festival organisers recruit leading musicians from other German orchestras, depending on their availability. Some musicians always arrange their schedules so as to be available for the orchestra; others participate less frequently.\n\n\n== Conductors ==\nConductors of the Bayreuth Festival Orchestra at the Bayreuth Festival have been:\n\nHans Richter: 1876, 1896–97, 1901–02, 1904, 1906, 1908\nHermann Levi: 1882 (premiere of Parsifal) et al.\nFelix Mottl: 1896\nSiegfried Wagner: 1896–97, 1899, 1901–02, 1906, 1928\nFranz Beidler: 1904 (Cosima Wagner's son-in-law)\nMichael Balling: 1909, 1911–12, 1914, 1924–25\nFranz von Hoesslin: 1927–28, 1940\nKarl Elmendorff: 1930–31, 1933–34, 1942\nHeinz Tietjen: 1934, 1936, 1938–39, 1941\nWilhelm Furtwängler: 1936-37\nHans Knappertsbusch: 1951, 1956–58\nHerbert von Karajan: 1951\nJoseph Keilberth: 1952-56\nClemens Krauss: 1953\nRudolf Kempe: 1960-63\nBerislav Klobučar: 1964\nKarl Böhm: 1965-67\nOtmar Suitner: 1966-67\nLorin Maazel: 1968-69\nHorst Stein: 1970-75\nPierre Boulez: 1976-80 (the centenary production Jahrhundertring)\nGeorg Solti: 1983\nPeter Schneider: 1984-86\nDaniel Barenboim: 1988-92\nJames Levine: 1994-98\nGiuseppe Sinopoli: 2000\nÁdám Fischer: 2001-04\nChristian Thielemann: 2006-10\nKirill Petrenko: 2013-15\nMarek Janowski: 2016-17\nPlácido Domingo: 2018 (3 performances of Die Walküre only)\nPietari Inkinen: 2022\nA number of other notable conductors have conducted the orchestra for recordings and broadcasts.\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Low Roar was an Iceland-based post-rock/electronica project founded by American immigrant Ryan Karazija. Originally a solo act, the band later added musicians Leifur Björnsson and Logi Guðmundsson.\nAfter releasing five albums spanning over a decade, the band and the project itself became discontinued following the death of Karazija in October 2022.  However, a posthumous sixth album will be released in February 2025.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter leading the California-based indie rock band Audrye Sessions from 2002 to 2010, Karazija relocated to Reykjavík, Iceland and started the new project Low Roar, releasing a self-titled album in 2011. A second album, 0, was released in 2014 through Tonequake Records, followed by Once in a Long, Long While... in mid-2017. The Low Roar album, ross., was released in November 2019, and the fifth album maybe tomorrow... was released in July 2021. A sixth album, titled House In The Woods, will be released on February 7, 2025.\nThe band's discography features heavily in the 2019 video game Death Stranding, following a collaboration with video game designer Hideo Kojima, after Kojima chanced upon their music while in a CD shop in Reykjavík. Kojima described Low Roar's music as \"sensual\" and \"unique\". When Sony first contacted the band to license their music for Death Stranding, the band was struggling, with much of their music being recorded on a laptop in Karazija's kitchen. The use of Low Roar's music in the video game had a significant positive influence on the band's popularity.\nIn 2021, they recorded the song \"Feels\" for the mobile game Arknights, later released in full under the title \"Fade Away\" on their 2021 album. Their song \"Help Me\" plays over the end credits of the 2021 film Flee.\nOn 29 October 2022, it was announced that Ryan Karazija, founder and lead singer of the band, had died at the age of 40. Hours later, it was revealed that the cause of death was from complications with pneumonia. It was also announced that a sixth album, which was being worked on as of 2022, would be eventually released.\nOn October 27, 2024, producer Andrew Scheps announced that the sixth album, House In The Woods, was finished, along with a release date of February 7, 2025. Additionally, Scheps announced two singles to support the album; Field of Dreams, releasing on December 6, and a second single releasing January 3.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nLow Roar (2011)\n0 (2014)\nOnce in a Long, Long While...

    "text": "The Pousette-Dart Band [poo-sette] (also known as PDB) was an American soft rock group active in the 1970s and early 1980s. Conceived in 1973 as a string band from Cambridge, Massachusetts, PDB comprised Jon Pousette-Dart, John Troy and John Curtis. With a shift to a more commercially oriented sound and a steady succession of additional personnel, the group went on to record a series of four albums for their label Capitol Records, two of which (Amnesia and Pousette-Dart Band 3) made the Billboard album chart. Their single \"For Love\" reached #83 on the Billboard singles chart.\nAlthough the band formally broke up in 1981, members reunited in 1991 for a series of concerts, and a \"Best Of\" album was released in 1994. Since then, collaborations among various former personnel have continued, with original members Pousette-Dart and Troy also launching solo careers.\nThe song \"Fall on Me\" from the band's second album Amnesia was featured in the 11th episode of the second season of Lost.\nPousette-Dart is the son of Abstract Expressionist artist Richard Pousette-Dart.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nAlbums\n\n1976: Pousette Dart Band\n1977: Amnesia, US Billboard # 143\n1978: Pousette-Dart Band 3, US Billboard # 161\n1979: Never Enough, US Billboard # 203\n1993: Best of Pousette Dart Band\nSingles\n\n1976: \"What Can I Say\"\n1977: \"Fall on Me\"\n1977: \"Amnesia\"\n1978: \"Stand by Me,\" US Cash Box # 103\n1979: \"For Love,\" US Billboard # 83\n1979: \"Hallelujah I'm a Bum\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJon Pousette-Dart official site\nJohn Troy official site"

They were joined by Geoff Lundren (bass), Elizabeth Lord (keyboards, backing vocals) and Chris Sweeney (drums) and signed with CBS Records in 1985. Mark Gray, Paul's brother, and Phil Witchett joined the group soon after and their debut single \"Stimulation\" was released in April 1986. The song peaked at number 2 in Australia. \"I Could Make You Love Me\" was released in August 1986 and peaked at number 5. In November 1986, Wa Wa Nee released their debut self-titled album which peaked at number 29 in Australia. Two more singles were released from the album, \"Sugar Free\" in December 1986 gave the band a third Australian Top 10 hit, and \"One and One (Ain't I Good Enough)\" in April 1987 which peaked inside the Top 20. \"Sugar Free\" was released in the United States in July 1987 and peaked at number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song featured in the film, Cassandra. \"Stimulation\" was released as the follow-up single where it peaked at number 86. It was featured in the film Satisfaction. In 1987, a remix album, titled Ulta Mixes was released.\nDuring the recording of the second studio album in 1988, keyboardist Phil Witchett died. In November 1988, \"Can't Control Myself\" was released as the lead single from the band's second studio album. The song peaked at number 31. Their second studio album, Blush was released in May 1989, and included two more hit singles, \"So Good\" and \"I Want You\". However, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, and the group disbanded later in 1989.\n\n\n=== Later works ===\nAfter the dissolution of Wa Wa Nee, bassist Mark Gray went on to work with Tania Bowra Band, with James Reyne and Indecent Obsession.\nAfter Wa Wa Nee, Steve Williams was asked by Paul Christie to join The Party Boys performing on the single 'Do Wah Diddy'. Williams toured in James Freud's band and with Richard Clapton. Williams moved to Europe and soon found a new passion, teaching music. After returning to Australia, he was sought after, performing with the likes of Swanee, Ray Parker Jr, Real Life, Lee Kernaghan, and Brian Cadd. Williams soon became a long time member of Australian Led Zeppelin band Zep Boys and a mainstay in Choirboys with Mark Gable. In 2006, he worked with the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra (ASO) and in 2008 accompanied the ASO and Deep Purple's Jon Lord for an Australian tour. He has also been invited to perform for Australian touring musical productions of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Man from Snowy River, Singin In The Rain and Elvis The Musical. He currently tours with Matt Finish and is a member of Absolutely 80s featuring Brian Mannix (Uncanny X-Men), Ally Fowler (Chantoozies) and many others. In 2022, Williams was inducted into the South Australian Music Hall of Fame.\nPaul Gray worked with Deni Hines, CDB, Kate Ceberano, Tina Arena and Bardot as a keyboard player, musical director, songwriter and producer. He appeared in the Countdown Spectacular 2 concert series in Australia between late August and early September 2007 as a performer and musical director. He sang two songs: \"Stimulation\" and \"Sugar Free\". He also appeared with 80s Enuff and Idols of the 80s. He performed Wa Wa Nee hits on 28 March 2010, at a fundraiser for the children of Jenin, a devastated area of the West Bank, Palestine. All funds went directly to the building of a pre-school in the area. He performed at local music venues in Melbourne in 2010, with fellow 1980s hitmakers, Scott Carne (Kids in the Kitchen) and Brian Mannix (Uncanny X-Men). Paul Gray supported Belinda Carlisle on some dates of her 2011 Australian Tour. Wa Wa Nee also supported Rick Astley during his 2012 and 2014 tour of Australia.\nPaul Gray died of multiple myeloma on 24 April 2018, aged 54.

    "text": "Jörg Widmann's Horn Concerto was composed in 2023–24 and premiered on 30 May 2024 with soloist Stefan Dohr and the Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of Simon Rattle at Berliner Philharmonie. The work has enigmatic as well as humorous elements.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 2023–24 season, Widmann was Berlin Philharmonic's Composer in Residence and made his debut conducting the orchestra. Widmann composed a concerto during the residency for the orchestras principle horn and dedicatee Stefan Dohr. The composer and the soloist had met with sketch material about ten times. With the premiere of this work Widmann's residency with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra came to an end.\nThe horn concerto has been commissioned by the Berlin Philharmonic, Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Stavanger Symphony Orchestra, Brussels Philharmonic and Lucerne Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe 7-movement horn concerto last 38 minutes. The number seven has been already used by Widmann in the opera Babylon and appears commonly in Mesopotamian tradition and theology. The movement titles are evokative.\n\nTraumbild (Reverie)\nAndantino grazioso\nScherzo à la surprise\nAdagietto\nZwischenwelt (Intermediate World)\nVorahnung (Premonition)\nFinale\n\nWidmann characterized the first movement Traumbild (Reverie) with \"Let there be sound\". The second movement Andantino grazioso is based on a theme of Carl Maria von Weber's Horn Concertino. Further citations in Scherzo à la surprise are Rossini, Johann Strauss I and Offenbach. The centrepiece Adagietto is reminiscent to Mahler. The enigmatic Vorahnung (Premonition) lays false trails and the Finale summarizes the thematic material of the preceding movements.

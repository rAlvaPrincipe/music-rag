    "text": "The Blackout Crew, also known as The Bards of Oldham, are a donk/rap group consisting of six rap artists – Cover, Allison, Heaton, Davis, Kabbani and Chadwick – from Halliwell, Bolton, Greater Manchester. \nTheir 2009 album Time 2 Shine peaked at No. 42 in the UK. Their album contained three singles: \"Bbbounce\", \"Put a Donk on It\" and \"Dialled\".\nThe lines \"You know what you wanna do with that, right? You wanna put a bangin' donk on it\" were frequently used in the opening of the BBC Radio 2/BBC Radio 6 Music programme Radcliffe & Maconie, being generally favoured by Mark Radcliffe. The Blackout Crew worked with electronic group Metronomy to provide a B-side remix for their 2008 single \"A Thing for Me\".\nIn 2023, Jax Jones released the single \"Won't Forget You\" with D.O.D. and Ina Wroldsen, which was shortly followed by a \"Donk Edit\" featuring Kurtis Chadwick (MC Viper), Jordan Cover (MC Cover) and Luke Purcell (MC Lukey P) from the newly reformed Blackout Crew, which peaked at number 28 on 16 November 2023 in the UK, far surpassing the original edit's peak of number 82 on 9 November 2023.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAnthony \"Tony\" Sabanskis (producer)\nJordan Cover (MC Cover)\nKevin Allison (MC Dowie)\nKurtis Chadwick (MC Viper)\nTony Heaton (MC Raver)\nRob Davis (MC Rapid)\nZak Kabbani (MC Zak K)\nMark Fullylove (MC Fullashite)\nAlan Titchmarsh (MC Ground Force)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBlack Out Crew at VICE, retrieved 18 December 2014.\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Blackout Crew official Facebook Page"

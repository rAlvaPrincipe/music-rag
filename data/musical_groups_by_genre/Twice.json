    "text": "Twice (Korean: 트와이스; RR: Teuwaiseu; Japanese: トゥワイス, Hepburn: Tuwaisu; commonly stylized in all caps) is a South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment. The group is composed of nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. Twice was formed under the television program Sixteen (2015) and debuted on October 20, 2015, with the extended play (EP) The Story Begins, and has received the honorific title of \"The Nation's Girl Group\" in their home country.\nTwice rose to domestic fame in 2016 with their single \"Cheer Up\", which charted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, became the best-performing single of the year, and won \"Song of the Year\" at the Melon Music Awards and Mnet Asian Music Awards. Their next single, \"TT\", from their third EP Twicecoaster: Lane 1, topped the Gaon charts for four consecutive weeks. The EP was the highest selling Korean girl group album of 2016. Within 19 months after debut, Twice had already sold over 1.2 million units of their four EPs and special album. As of 2022, the group has sold over 14 million albums cumulatively in South Korea and Japan.\nThe group debuted in Japan on June 28, 2017, under Warner Music Japan, with the release of a compilation album titled #Twice. The album charted at number 2 on the Oricon Albums Chart with the highest first-week album sales by a K-pop artist in Japan in two years. It was followed by the release of Twice's first original Japanese maxi single titled \"One More Time\" in October. Twice became the first Korean girl group to earn a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for both an album and CD single in the same year. Twice ranked third in the Top Artist category of Billboard Japan's 2017 Year-end Rankings, and in 2019, they became the first Korean girl group to embark on a Japanese dome tour.\nTwice is the first female Korean act to simultaneously top both Billboard's World Albums and World Digital Song Sales charts with the release of their first studio album Twicetagram and its lead single \"Likey\" in 2017. With the release of their single \"Feel Special\" in 2019, Twice became the third female Korean act to chart into the Canadian Hot 100. After signing with Republic Records for American promotions as part of a partnership with JYP Entertainment, the group achieved five top-ten albums on the US Billboard 200 and topped the chart in 2024 with their thirteenth extended play With You-th. Their first official English-language single, \"The Feels\" (2021), became their first song to enter the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, peaking at the 83rd and 80th positions of the charts, respectively. Their point choreography—including for \"Cheer Up\" (2016), \"TT\" (2016), \"Signal\" (2017), and \"What Is Love?\" (2018)—became dance crazes and viral memes.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2013–2015: Formation and debut ===\n\nOn December 19, 2013, JYP Entertainment (JYPE) announced that they would debut a new girl group in the first half of 2014, the first female group to come out of the company since the debut of Miss A in 2010. On February 27, 2014, JYPE trainees Lena and Cecilia were confirmed as members of the group tentatively called as 6MIX, while other rumored members included JYPE trainees Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Jihyo, and Minyoung. The group's debut plan was eventually canceled when Lena and Cecilia left the company.\n\nOn February 11, 2015, J. Y. Park, the founder of JYPE, announced that the lineup of the upcoming seven-member girl group would be decided through Sixteen, a competition survival show that would air on Mnet later that year. The show began on May 5 and ended on July 7 with Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung being selected as the seven Twice members. Park then announced that he would increase the size of the group from seven members to nine by adding Tzuyu, who was known as the \"audience's pick\" since she was the most popular contestant by the show's end, and Momo, who was added by Park himself since he felt the group needed someone with Momo's performance abilities. The decision was controversial at the time, with many people complaining about eliminated contestants being able to join the group. The group's name, Twice, was chosen by Park, explaining that \"the group will touch people's hearts twice: once through the ears, and once again through the eyes\". Fans of Twice are known as \"Once\", commonly stylized in all caps, illustrated by the members' statement \"If you love us even once, we will repay your love with twice of our love\" on social media in 2015.\nTwice made their official debut on October 20, 2015, with the release of their debut EP The Story Begins and its lead single \"Like Ooh-Ahh\", alongside a live showcase to promote it. The group initially received a lukewarm reception; while their EP debuted at number 4 on the Gaon Album Chart for the week ending October 24 (before peaking at number 3 two weeks later), \"Like Ooh-Ahh\" met moderate success, debuting at number 22 on the Gaon Digital Chart. A week after its release, the single dropped to number 57 on South Korea's largest music site Melon, but through word of mouth from netizens regarding the group's subsequent promotions and performances, \"Like Ooh-Ahh\" reached within the top 10 of various Korean music charts including Melon, Genie, and Naver Music by November 15. Such a reverse run on music charts by a rookie girl group was deemed unusual by Korean media. Eventually, \"Like Ooh-Ahh\" reached a peak position of number 10 on the Gaon Digital Chart, three months after the song's original release. The music video for the group's single hit 50 million views on YouTube within five months of their debut and became one of the most-viewed debut music videos for any K-pop group. The group's early success earned them a \"Best New Female Artist\" award at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards held on December 2. On December 27, Twice performed a remix version of their single \"Like Ooh-Ahh\" at SBS Gayo Daejeon, which was the group's first-ever attendance on a year-end music program.\n\n\n=== 2016: Career breakthrough ===\n\nOn its chart issue dated January 23, 2016, Billboard reported that Twice had entered its World Albums chart, with their debut EP The Story Begins debuting and peaking at number 15, which marked the group's first entry on the chart.\nOn April 25, 2016, Twice released their second EP, Page Two, which notably included the lead single \"Cheer Up\", a rearranged version of Park Ji-yoon's 1998 hit \"Precious Love\", and \"I'm Gonna Be a Star\", which served as the theme song for Sixteen. The album became a commercial success for the group, debuting at number two on the Gaon Album Chart and number six on the Billboard World Albums chart, with 80,686 units sold during the month of April. With the total first-week sales volume for Page Two reaching approximately 41,800 copies, Twice achieved the highest first-week sales volume by a Korean girl group for the year. By August, Page Two had sold over 150,000 copies, making Twice the first girl group having a sales record of more than 100,000 units that year. Meanwhile, the album's lead single \"Cheer Up\" became the group's first chart-topper in South Korea, debuting at number 1 on eight real-time music charts immediately after its release, before going on to debut atop both the Gaon Digital Chart and the Billboard K-pop Hot 100 chart. Notably, the song became a viral meme in South Korea due to the \"shy shy shy\" line sung by Sana. Eventually, the song became the best-performing single in South Korea for the entirety of 2016. \"Cheer Up\" also received international success, debuting and peaking at number three on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart. Additionally, Twice became the only Korean act to place an entry on the U.S. YouTube Music Chart for the year when \"Cheer Up\" charted at number 25 in May.\nTwice won their first music program award with \"Cheer Up\" on May 5, on M Countdown, exactly one year after the initial airing of Sixteen. This was soon followed by wins on Music Bank and Inkigayo. The group then made their debut performance in the United States with an appearance at the KCON music festival held in Los Angeles on July 31. On August 6–7, Twice and their JYP Entertainment labelmates held a concert at Jamsil Arena in Seoul, titled JYP Nation 2016 \"Mix & Match\". This was followed by shows at Yoyogi National Gymnasium in Tokyo on September 2–4.\nIn celebration of Twice's first anniversary since debut on October 20, the group unveiled their new song \"One in a Million\" from their upcoming third EP, Twicecoaster: Lane 1, through a live broadcast on V Live. Twicecoaster: Lane 1 and the music video of pop dance song \"TT\" were released online on October 24. In Korea, the album recorded more than 165,000 physical copies sold on the Gaon Chart within a week, exceeding the five-month sales of the group's previous release Page Two in only seven days. Eventually, Twicecoaster: Lane 1 became the bestselling K-pop girl group album for 2016, selling 350,852 copies at year-end. Its lead single \"TT\" became one of the best-performing songs in 2016, claiming the top spot of the Gaon Digital Chart for four consecutive weeks and becoming the best-performing single in South Korea for the month of November. Internationally, the group's third EP debuted at number 3 on the Billboard World Albums chart, marking their first Top 5 entry, with the album's lead single \"TT\" debuting at number 2 on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart. \"TT\" then became the first music video by a K-pop female act to surpass 200 million views on May 25, 2017.\nOn November 11, the music video for their debut single \"Like Ooh-Ahh\" hit 100 million views on YouTube, making Twice the fourth K-pop girl group to reach 100 million views, as well as the first K-pop group to reach this milestone with a debut music video. On November 19, Twice's \"Cheer Up\" won Song of the Year at the 8th Melon Music Awards. It was then followed by another Song of the Year award at the 18th Mnet Asian Music Awards on December 2.\n\n\n=== 2017: First concert tour and debut in Japan ===\n\nOn January 10, JYPE announced Twice's first solo concert tour within just a year and four months after debuting in October 2015. The three-day sold-out concert titled \"Twice 1st Tour: Twiceland – The Opening\" was held on February 17–19 at the SK Olympic Handball Gymnasium. A tour across Thailand and Singapore was also held after the first stop in Seoul. After the Korean leg of the concert tour, Twice released a special album on February 20 titled Twicecoaster: Lane 2, along with its lead single, \"Knock Knock\". The album was a reissue of Twicecoaster: Lane 1. The album debuted atop the Gaon Album Chart and charted at number four on the Billboard World Albums chart, selling 266,645 copies by the end of February. Its lead single \"Knock Knock\" debuted atop the Gaon Digital Chart, and peaked at numbers 5 and 15 on the World Digital Song Sales and Japan Hot 100, respectively.\nTwice launched their Japanese website and social media channels in early February. On February 24, they officially announced their Japanese debut with a compilation album titled #Twice which was set to be released on June 28. On May 15, Twice released their fourth EP titled Signal with the lead track of the same name, produced by Park Jin-young. This marked the group's first collaboration with Park. The EP contains six tracks, including \"Eye Eye Eyes\" co-written by members Jihyo and Chaeyoung, and \"Only You\" written by former Wonder Girls member Ha:tfelt.

The group's fourth Japanese studio album, Celebrate, was released on July 27 to commemorate the fifth anniversary of their debut in Japan. Its lead single of the same name was pre-released as a digital single on July 15. On August 26, Twice released their eleventh Korean EP, Between 1&2, and its lead single, \"Talk That Talk\". Between 1&2 was Twice's first album to sell one million copies, and the group surpassed 14 million cumulative album sales by the end of the year.\nOn January 20, 2023, Twice released a pre-release English single, \"Moonlight Sunrise\", ahead of their twelfth Korean EP, Ready to Be. The EP and its lead single, \"Set Me Free\", were released on March 10. Ready to Be had 1.7 million pre-order sales and is Twice's bestselling album to date. The group embarked on their fifth world tour, \"Ready to Be\", with a two-day concert in Seoul on April 15–16. On May 31, Twice released their tenth Japanese single, \"Hare Hare\", which was created for their first stadium concerts in Japan. With four sold-out dates at Yanmar Stadium Nagai and Ajinomoto Stadium, Twice became the first K-pop girl group to hold a concert at a stadium in Japan. The North American leg of the \"Ready to Be\" World Tour concluded on July 9, and included sold-out concerts at SoFi Stadium and MetLife Stadium, a first for any K-pop girl group.\nOn February 2, 2024, Twice released the single \"I Got You\". The song serves as the pre-release single from their thirteenth Korean EP, With You-th, which was released on February 23 along with the lead single \"One Spark\". The group released their fifth Japanese studio album, Dive, on July 17. That same month, they concluded the \"Ready to Be\" World Tour with a series of special concerts in Japan, becoming the first foreign female artist to headline a concert at Nissan Stadium. The tour was their largest yet, with 51 shows in 27 cities across Asia, North America, South America, Oceania, and Europe, and 1.5 million attendees in total.\nOn October 20, Twice held a fan meeting titled \"Home 9round\" to commemorate the ninth anniversary of their debut. During the event, they performed the unreleased track \"Sweetest Obsession\" and announced their fourteenth EP, Strategy, which was released on December 6. On October 25, Twice was featured on a remix of Megan Thee Stallion's \"Mamushi\". In turn, Megan Thee Stallion featured on Strategy's lead single, \"Strategy\". On November 21, Twice became the first K-pop artist to headline Amazon Music Live, with their performance having the most unique viewers of any Amazon Music production to date on both Twitch and Prime Video. In April 2025, Twice will open all six shows of Coldplay's Music of the Spheres World Tour in Seoul as the special guest.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nTwice is most notable for their consistent employment of \"cute\" concepts which was further supported by the group's bubblegum pop sound, which was seen as a departure from the usual retro style of music that was seen in their predecessor labelmates and fellow girl groups Wonder Girls and Miss A. The group had come to develop a signature \"color pop\" sonic style described as a combination of rock, R&B, and hip hop coupled with notable hooks in their music. In the group's early years, teen pop represented their discography since teenagers were their target audience. Their \"cheerful\" musical base was employed alongside a colorful style in terms of the members' fashion. While they have gained notability for emphasizing their youthful image, Twice has since adopted a more mature style. This was first seen in 2019 with the release of \"Fancy\" and \"Breakthrough\", which saw the group perform more sensual choreography for the former while employing a brassier electro-pop sound in the latter. They have since experimented with EDM, synth-pop, and retro soul among others in their eighth EP Feel Special; tropical house, Latin pop, and new jack swing in their ninth EP More & More; retro-synth, dance-pop, Japanese city-pop, and contemporary R&B in their second Korean studio album Eyes Wide Open; and disco-pop, reggae-pop, and trap in their third Korean studio album Formula of Love: O+T=<3.\nThe group is also known for incorporating modern online culture into their musical releases and their corresponding music videos. For instance, their 2016 single \"TT\" is named after the crying emoticon which was imitated in the group's point choreography, while their 2017 track \"Likey\" lyrically alludes to Instagram culture and the struggles of maintaining a beautiful social media image. In the music video for their 2018 single \"What Is Love?\", the group referenced several movies including The Princess Diaries, Ghost, La Boum, Pulp Fiction, Romeo + Juliet, Love Letter, La La Land, and Leon: The Professional.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\nTwice have been well received in South Korea, ranking second in the top ten artists of the Gallup Korea survey for three consecutive years, making them the highest-ranking Korean group in 2016 and 2017, and the highest-ranking girl group in 2018. Since 2016, members regularly have placed in the top 20 of Gallup Korea's annual poll of the nation's favorite idols. In 2017, Twice was included in Forbes Korea Power Celebrity at third overall and first among recording artists. They entered within the top ten of the list again ranking third in 2018, and ninth in 2020. Twice has also been recognized for their brand recognition and marketing power, having topped the \"Girl Group Brand Power Ranking\" published by the Korean Corporate Reputation Research Institute several times. The group's success and domestic popularity was key in the rise of JYP Entertainment's stock, which increased in value by a factor of seven in less than three years; since the group's debut in 2015, prices rose from ₩4,500 to ₩31,400 in 2018. The group is also credited as among the key reasons for a significant increase in JYP Entertainment's market cap, from ₩1.33 trillion in 2021 to ₩2.24 trillion in 2022. During the 2017 South Korean presidential election, then-candidate Moon Jae-in from the Democratic party and candidate Yoo Seong-min from the Bareun party both used Twice's song \"Cheer Up\" with modified lyrics as their campaign jingles.\n\nFollowing their consecutive commercial successes in 2016 and 2017 Twice has since been dubbed by Korean media as the \"Nation's Girl Group\", being cited as a follow-up to previously successful girl groups Girls' Generation and Kara. Music critic Kang Tae-gyu has described Twice as being \"one step ahead of the current period\" among other girl groups from the same period of their debut. The group's commercial performance following their career breakthrough in 2016 was considered by the media to be 'remarkable' in an industry dominated by all-male music groups. Twice's distinctive point choreography—including for \"Cheer Up\" (2016), \"TT\" (2016) and \"Signal\" (2017)— became dance crazes and viral memes imitated by many celebrities in South Korea. In a survey conducted by media outlet Sports Chosun done in 2020 wherein representatives from several Korean entertainment agencies were surveyed on their choice for the top girl group, Twice was ranked at number 1 with 83 points, with agency officials citing the group's strong digital and physical sales alongside their pan-Asia success. A similar survey was conducted by media outlet Sports Seoul in the same year, with Twice also ranking at number 1 as the best female idol group among Korean entertainment industry officials with 111 points, citing the group's role in leading the re-emergence of girl groups in the Korean wave.\nIn Japan, the group's positive reputation and relatability amongst fans were attributed by local media to the presence of Japanese members Momo, Sana, and Mina who gained Twice fame in the country even before their debut. NHK News credited the group's commercial success with helping mend relations between Japan and South Korea. An example of Twice's popularity in Japan was seen after the release of their song \"TT\", in which the track's signature pose was imitated by several Japanese celebrities and idols including AKB48 and Nogizaka46. When Twice officially debuted in Japan through the release of their compilation album #Twice, the Tokyo Tower Observatory commemorated the event by displaying \"TT\" on the landmark—it was the first time that the Tokyo Tower had collaborated with an artist for a display, and was regarded as an unusual development by local media. Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun called Twice the \"new protagonist in the dominance of Japan's Korean wave content market\", while Korean press remarked that the group is \"reigniting the heat of K-pop in Japan\". Twice is one of two Korean acts that have been credited with leading a third \"Hallyu\" wave in Japan.\nInternationally, Twice's notable bubblegum pop sound and distinctive choreography has led to the group receiving recognition by Time magazine as among the stand-out groups in K-pop. With much of K-pop's success in the United States being attributed to most Korean acts employing either hip-hop or EDM as their sonic base, Billboard has noted the success of Twice in making their bubblegum sound attract Western appeal, following the group's release of their song \"Dance The Night Away\". The South China Morning Post has named Twice as among three major female K-pop groups who are considered as \"game-changers in a boy band-led industry\", which was seen when Twice's eighth EP Feel Special became the bestselling girl group album in South Korea in 2019 and their feat of being the first Korean female group to hold a Japanese dome tour. The group's domestic and international success has led to Forbes magazine to include them in their \"30 Under 30\" list in 2020. Twice was also included in Forbes Asia's inaugural \"100 Digital Stars\" list, which highlights personalities from the Asia-Pacific region with an established influence in social and digital media. The group was included in Bloomberg's Pop Star Power Rankings for the month of July 2020, ranking at number 12.\n\n\n== Awards and achievements ==\n\nTwice received its first award at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards as Best New Female Artist, followed by another New Artist Award at the 2016 Golden Disc Awards.\nIn 2016, Twice won its first music program award with \"Cheer Up\" on the May 5 episode of M Countdown. The group also won several main and grand prize awards including Song of the Year with \"Cheer Up\" in two major music awards shows, Melon Music Awards and Mnet Asian Music Awards. Their second EP, Twicecoaster: Lane 1, was the fifth-highest-selling K-pop album of 2016 and the highest among girl groups. In 2017, \"Signal\" from their fourth extended play of the same name achieved Twice's second Song of the Year award at the 2017 Mnet Asian Music Awards, making them the first artist to consecutively win the grand prize. With a total of 36 music program trophies in 2017, Twice recorded the most wins received in a single year. Twice ranked second on Oricon's Breakout Artists of 2017 and became the first overseas female act to achieve a rookie triple crown on the 50th Oricon Annual Ranking. Twice also placed first in rookie artist total sales in 2017, with sales reaching 1.54 billion yen, as well as first-place among albums and singles for #Twice and \"One More Time\" respectively.\nBy May of the following year, they became the first artist to win seven consecutive Triple Crowns on Inkigayo. Twice received their third consecutive Song of the Year award at the 2018 Mnet Asian Music Awards with \"What Is Love?\" from their fifth extended play of the same name, making them the first group to win the award for three consecutive years. Twice topped the list of Korea's most popular music video on YouTube for two consecutive years with \"Cheer Up\" (2016) and \"Knock Knock\" (2017). In 2020, Twice became the K-pop girl group with the most music show wins totaling 106 wins as well as the fastest group to reach that number.\nTwice was included in Variety's Youth Impact Report 2016—an annual list of young entertainers who have made an impact in the industry over the past year—at number 54 as the only K-pop group on the list. In 2017, Twice received the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Commendation at the Korean Popular Culture and Arts Awards. They were then recognized as the only Asian act on Billboard's 21 Under 21 2017: Music's Next Generation, an annual ranking that highlights some of the world's most powerful young voices across various music genres.\nIn 2021, Twice's tenth extended play, Taste of Love, peaked at number-one on the Billboard Top Album Sales chart, making it the first EP from a girl group to do so. It was also the first EP from a girl group to enter the top 10 of the Billboard 200.\nOn March 1, 2023, Twice was awarded the Breakthrough Artist at the 2023 Billboard Women in Music held in Los Angeles. This marks the first time a female K-Pop group has won this award.\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Endorsements ===\n\nEven before the official debut of Twice, the nine members had signed contracts as exclusive models for school uniform brand Skoolooks, alongside J. Y. Park. By December 2015, Twice had signed ten CF contracts, totaling earnings of ₩1.8 billion. By February 2017, they had one of the fastest growths in the advertising industry as the group's rate charged for endorsement hit ₩200 million for 6 months and ₩300 million for a year.\nTwice is one of the celebrity endorsers of Lotte Duty Free. They also collaborated with shoe company Spris and created their own shoe brand called \"Twice by Spris\". In early 2017, Twice was selected by beverage maker Donga Otsuka to promote the company's flagship sports drink Pocari Sweat on its 30th anniversary. They became the first idol group to model for the brand. Pocari Sweat recorded ₩100 billion in sales for the first half of the year, a 10% increase over 2016's sales.\nAs of 2017, Twice has represented about 30 different brands including cosmetics, clothing, online and mobile games, food and beverages, credit cards, and more. Twice's first TV commercial in Japan for Ymobile was aired nationwide starting February 2, 2018, incorporating a pop arrangement of \"Y.M.C.A.\" and Twice's signature \"TT pose\". In 2019, Twice was selected as South Korean ambassador of Estée Lauder. The group also became \"Global Benchsetters\" for Philippine clothing brand Bench. In March 2021, Kyungnam Pharmaceuticals announced that it had selected Twice as the representatives for its flagship vitamin brand Lemona. Later that year, Nintendo Korea featured Twice playing the Nintendo Switch game Mitopia in a video. In August 2021, the group was chosen to perform for Shopee Philippines's 9.9 Super Shopping Day TV special that was held on September 9. On October 16, 2021, Scarlett Whitening, an Indonesian beauty brand known for its skin whitening products, introduced Twice as their brand ambassadors. The endorsement was, however, criticized by fans, calling JYP Entertainment to withdraw the deal as it would be \"unethical\" for Twice to endorse a brand with skin whitening products, \"knowing that they have fans with darker skin complexions\". In 2023, Filipino snack brand Oishi selected Twice as their endorsers.\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nIn February 2023, Twice donated ₩200 million (US$153,178.94) to help with the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake through Save the Children.\n\n\n== Members ==\nNayeon (나연) – vocalist, dancer\nJeongyeon (정연) – vocalist\nMomo (모모) – dancer, vocalist, rapper\nSana (사나) – vocalist\nJihyo (지효) – leader, vocalist\nMina (미나) – dancer, vocalist\nDahyun (다현) – rapper, vocalist\nChaeyoung (채영) – rapper, vocalist\nTzuyu (쯔위) – dancer, vocalist\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\nIn July 2019, Mina took a break from activities due to her sudden extreme anxiety and insecurity problems in performing on stage.

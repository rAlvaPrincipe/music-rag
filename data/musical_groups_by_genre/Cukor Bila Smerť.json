    "text": "Cukor Bila Smerť (Ukrainian: Цукор — біла смерть, IPA: [ˈt͡sukɔr ˈbʲiɫɐ smɛrtʲ]; lit. Sugar — White Death) was a Ukrainian rock band formed in Kyiv, Ukraine. The band was active from 1988, until its dissolution in 1993. It was one of the first bands that initiated the creation of the ethno-gothic scene in Ukraine. Considered to be one of the most prominent music bands of Ukrainian underground.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe main figure of this project was Svitlana Nianio. After graduating from music school with a degree in piano, she began composing music. At first, she played with cellist Tamila Mazur. Sugar - White Death was formed when they were joined by guitarist Jevhen Taran and pianist Oleksandr Kochanovskyj. The band significantly differed from the music of that time by high female vocals, non-sensical lyrics, and, previously unknown, instrumental-gothic performance.\nIn 1988 they released their debut album, Rododendrony Karalovi Aspydy. A year after, in 1989, two more albums were released: a compilation Novye Nezhenki and a studio album Lilei I Amarillisy.\nIn 1991, in collaboration with Ukrainian musician Ivan Samshyt, a more industrial-sounding album called Samshit Ne Sahar was released.\nAt that time, alternative bands were not able to make professional recordings in Ukraine and like other well-known Ukrainian bands, they recorded on the Polish label Koka Records. Two albums are available on this label: Manirna Muzyka (1991) and Selo\" (1993).\nAccording to another prominent Ukrainian underground musician, Ihor Cymbrovskyj, who also recorded for Koka Records, the band has fans in Poland, where there are more listeners of such music than in Ukraine. In particular, Polish experimental band Księżyc have repeatedly stated that they were inspired by the works of Svitlana Nianio.\nThe collective disbanded in 1993, after which, former members continued to release solo records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio Albums ===\nRododendrony Karalovi Aspydy (1988)\nLilei I Amarillisy (1989)\nManirna Muzyka (1991)\nSelo (1993)\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nSamshit Ne Sahar (with Ivan Samshyt; 1991)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nNovye Nezhenki (1989)\n\n\n== Sources ==\nЦукор тільки на експорт // «Moloda Hvardija» (Kyiv). 15 May 1991.

Carter and Duncan were session musicians who were known for their contribution to Hazel O'Connor's Breaking Glass album and film.\nAfter their first hit in 1980, the band slimmed down to a duo of Grant and Martin. Peter Martin (the bassist) joined the band 23 Skidoo. Junior Giscombe became a pop singer in his own right.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nLinx had six entries on the UK Singles Chart from mid-1980 until mid-1982.

    "text": "Oxbow was an American experimental rock band from San Francisco, California. Founded in 1988, the band released eight studio albums, disbanding in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nOxbow began as a recording project of Eugene Robinson who wanted to record a solo album as his planned suicidal note. Eugene started to record bass and drums by himself but realized that he's not good at either instrument. Eugene started to work on the album with sound engineer Bart Thurber, who was a former guitarist in Eugene's band Whipping Boy. But Eugene, after realizing that he \"had zero musical skills\", asked Niko Wenner, the guitarist in Whipping Boy, to help with the record. In 1988 Eugene Robinson (vocals, lyrics) and Niko Wenner (guitar, bass, keyboards, music) wrote songs with an approach decidedly different from Whipping Boy. Wenner concocted an underlying musical architecture for his abrasive-then-plangent music, through use of arch form and musical palindromes unusual in the noise music genre the band was often placed. This organizing structure later grew to encompass the second Oxbow recording as well, and drew relationships between the two.  For his part Robinson changed his vocal approach to include in-the-studio improvisations and extensive vocal multi-tracking. This first record, titled Fuckfest has drumming split evenly between Greg Davis and Tom Dobrov. The record received positive response, so Eugene Robinson decided to continue. Dan Adams (bass in Oxbow, drums in Whipping Boy) joined immediately on completion of the first recording. All but Davis were at various times members of Whipping Boy, Wenner and Dobrov had been bandmates in the hardcore band Grim Reality Dobrov departed amicably after the band's 1995 European tour, but performed as guest second-drummer, with Davis, for the studio recording of \"Shine (Glimmer)\" on the 2002 album An Evil Heat.\nThe first album from Oxbow, Fuckfest, was released in 1989. It was described as \"one of the most unique first statements in modern avant-rock\" by Rock-A-Rolla magazine, \"staggeringly eclectic\" by Simon Reynolds, and \"a fierce, rigorous album that challenges almost every preconception rock listeners might have\" by Allmusic. Fuckfest was followed by King of the Jews (1991) and then by two Steve Albini-recorded albums: Let Me Be a Woman (1995) and Serenade in Red (1996–97), the latter featuring guest vocals from Marianne Faithfull. An Evil Heat followed in 2002 on Neurosis' Neurot Recordings label. Oxbow's 2007 album The Narcotic Story was named the number one album in the \"Best of 2007\" by Rock-A-Rolla magazine, and was listed with three other bands' albums in the nomination of Joe Chiccarelli as 'Producer of the Year' at the 50th Grammy Awards.\nIn May 2017 Oxbow released Thin Black Duke their seventh full-length album, like The Narcotic Story produced by Joe Chiccarelli and Niko Wenner and again on Hydra Head Records, to critical acclaim.\nThey returned in 2023 with Love’s Holiday, released July 21. \nOn July 7, 2024, Robinson announced his departure from the band.\nLater, on July 11, Wenner released a statement regarding allegations that had been made against him following a show in France, announcing that, until further notice, Oxbow was no longer a band.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nOxbow's material is musically varied and has been compared both to bands such as Neurosis and The Birthday Party, and modern classical composers such as Penderecki and John Luther Adams. Elements of blues, noise rock, heavy metal, jazz, and contemporary classical music are consistently mentioned. Allmusic writer Jason Ankeny identified elements of free jazz and musique concrète.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Final line-up ===\nEugene S.

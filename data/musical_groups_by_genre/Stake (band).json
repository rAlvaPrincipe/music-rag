Shortly after this victory a home recorded album When the Candle Dies Out... was released.\nIn March 2011 the band released their second album All is Chaos produced by Mario Goossens and mixed by Matt Bayles. The album received overwhelmingly positive feedback and was later released in 2012 in the UK by Metal Hammer, who then added the band to their Razor Tour at the end of the year.

One week before its Belgian release, De Standaard posted an online stream of the full album.\nIn 2018, they changed their name to Stake.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nWhen the Candle Dies Out...

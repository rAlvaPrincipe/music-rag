He appeared regularly as a soloist and chamber musician at major music festivals and concert venues throughout Europe, America, and Asia, he has served as an  honorary professor at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music.  Jezierski also taught at the Berliner Philharmoniker's academy, the Karajan Akademie.  His interest in playing jazz on the horn inspired him to form a jazz quintet with other top North American players living in Berlin and has led to onstage improvisations with such musicians as Nigel Kennedy.  \nJezierski remained with the Berlin Philharmonic until his retirement in February 2022, the longest-serving horn player in the orchestra.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nScharoun Ensemble page\nInstagram page of Stefan de Leval Jezierski"

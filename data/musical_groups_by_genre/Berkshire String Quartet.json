    "text": "The Berkshire String Quartet was an American classical chamber group founded and funded in 1916 at the height of World War I by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge.  The quartet, originally, was the Kortschak String Quartet, named for Hugo Kortschak (1884–1957), a member of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 1907 until 1914 (serving as assistant concertmaster from 1910 until 1914).  Kortschak was a key figure in organizing the Berkshire Chamber Music Festival founded by Coolidge.  The original Berkshire String Quartet disbanded sometime after 1941.\nIn July 1948, the successors of the Gordon Quartet were about to disband for a lack of funding and loss of its founder, Jacques Gordon (1897–1948), who had disbanded the quartet in 1947 due to ill health.  Coolidge came to the rescue.  She underwrote enough additional performances to make the quartet's summer season possible.  But, according to Time magazine, Coolidge, for one of the few times in her life, asked a sentimental favor in return.  \"Would the quartet please call itself the Berkshire Quartet?\" The quartet agreed and, at the urging of Wilfred Bain, moved its permanent residence to the Indiana University School of Music.  The quartet continued to maintain its summer residence at Music Mountain, a hilltop near Falls Village, Connecticut, where, in 1930, Gordon had founded a Chamber Music Festival named after the hilltop.\n\n\n== Former members ==\nFounding members in 1916, in residence at Pittsfield, Massachusetts\n\nHugo Kortschak (1884–1957) (first violin)\nSerge Kotlarsky (1893–1987) (second violin)\nClarance Evans (viola)\nEmmeran Stoeber (1882–1945) (cello)\nOther members at Pittsfield\n\nHermann Julius Felber, Jr. ( –1892) (second violin, debut 1917) †\nÉmile August Ferir (1873–1949) (viola)\nEdouard Dethier (1885–1962) †\n† In 1917, Hermann Felber was drafted into the US Army; Edouard Dethier of New York played in his place.\nSuccessor of the Gordon Quartet beginning in 1948, in residence at Indiana University and Music Mountain\nFounding members in 1948\n\nUrico Rossi (1916–2001) (first violin), formerly a student of Kortschak\nAlbert Lazan (1914–2003) (second violin)\nDavid Dawson ( –1975) (viola)\nFritz Magg (1914–1997) (cello)\nOther members after 1948\n\nJerry Horner (1935–2019) (violist from 1975–1976)\nPaul Biss (viola)\n\n\n== See also ==\nZhanna Arshanskaya Dawson, David Dawson's wife\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Music Mountain.

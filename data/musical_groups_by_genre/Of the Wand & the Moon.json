    "text": "Of the Wand & the Moon (stylized as :Of the Wand & the Moon: (later releases feature \"and\" in lieu of the ampersand)) is the neofolk/experimental project of Danish musician Kim Larsen and various guest contributors.\n\n\n== History ==\nLarsen was originally a member of the gothic/doom metal band Saturnus, but left due to personal disputes. Following this, he began the neofolk project Of the Wand & the Moon, as he was a longtime fan of the genre. \nLarsen lists among his musical influences the neofolk artists Death in June, Blood Axis, Current 93, Sol Invictus, Fire and Ice, Der Blutharsch, and Nature and Organisation. He credits Thunder Perfect Mind by Current 93 with making him want to be a neofolk artist, and calls Death in June's Rose Clouds of Holocaust the albums that \"means the most\" to him. Thematically, he is influenced by runes, Aleister Crowley, Norse mythology, esoterica, and paganism. He once described his music as \"loner folk\".\nIn 1999, the debut Of the Wand & the Moon album was released, titled Nighttime Nightrhymes.\n2001 saw the release of a second Of the Wand & the Moon release titled :Emptiness:Emptiness:Emptiness:.\nAfter the release of a split album with Sol Invictus and a few vinyl singles, a collection of b-sides, taken from the :Emptiness:Emptiness:Emptiness: sessions, titled Lucifer, was released in 2003.\nA third album, Sonnenheim, was released in 2005. Here, the music bears a strong resemblance to that of neofolk pioneers Death in June.\nAfter a 6-year silence, a fourth album, The Lone Descent, was released in 2011. It features more contemporary influences and a richer production. The album was received with great critical acclaim and is considered a neofolk masterpiece.\n10 years later, in 2021, a fifth album entitled Your Love Can't Hold This Wreath of Sorrow was released. It follows in a similar vein to that of The Lone Descent, but features even greater experimentation with other genres such as post-punk and electronica.\nIn 2023, a 4-track EP, Behold the Trees, saw the band embody a more minimalistic ambient sound with a spoken word approach to the vocals.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums and EPs ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n=== Official ===\nOfficial :Of The Wand & The Moon: Site\nOfficial :Of The Wand & The Moon: Myspace\nOfficial :Of The Wand & The Moon: Facebook\n\n\n==== Reviews ====\nReview of \"The Lone Descent\" on Heathen Harvest\nReview of \"Lucifer\" on Sputnik Music"

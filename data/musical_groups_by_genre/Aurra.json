    "text": "Aurra was an American 1980s soul group, which, at the time of its biggest success on Salsoul Records, featured Curt Jones (guitar/vocals) and Starleana Young (vocals) and included Steve Washington (bass/guitar/drums), Philip Field (keyboards/synthesizers/vocals) and Tom Lockett (saxophone/percussion).\n\n\n== Career ==\nAurra started off in 1979 as an offshoot of the funk band Slave. Steve Washington  first conceptualized the project, which also initially featured fellow former Slave members Curt Jones, Starleana Young, and Thomas Lockett. By the time they recorded their first LP, the lineup also included Charles Carter and Buddy Hankerson. Aurra initially signed with Dream Records, and then Salsoul Records. Composer/keyboardist Philip Field, known for his work as a member of Mtume, subsequently joined the lineup. \nDuring the early 1980s, the group found success with hits such as \"Are You Single\" (number 16 on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart), \"Checkin' You Out\", and \"Make Up Your Mind\", the last of which became the group's biggest US hit under the Aurra moniker - reaching number six on the R&B chart and number 71 on the pop chart. The group continued to release albums up through the 1985 release Like I Like It; this album was released as Bedtime Story in the U.S. that same year. A revamped version of Like I Like It, featuring an updated cover, was released in Europe in 1986 to include the new single, \"You and Me Tonight\", along with remixed versions of other tracks from the original album. \"You and Me Tonight\" reached number 12 on the British charts that year.\nBy the time Like I Like It was re-released, several group members were at odds with Steve Washington. Legal issues with Washington over the name Aurra led to the duo of principal members Jones and Young breaking away and beginning to record under the name Déjà. In 1987, they released their Virgin Records debut as Déjà, Serious, which was produced in large part by the Time member Monte Moir. Featured on this album was \"You and Me Tonight,\" from the group's Aurra days, introducing American audiences to the song for the first time. \"You and Me Tonight\" charted in the upper reaches of the US Billboard R&B chart (peaking at number 2) and crossed over onto the pop charts, where it peaked at number 54, making it the highest-charting single from any Aurra-associated group. Meanwhile, Starleana Young decided to leave to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Mysti Day in time to record Déjà's follow-up album. The resulting album, Made to Be Together was released in 1989, with the Teddy Riley-produced title track becoming a minor R&B hit.\nIn 2013, Family Groove Records recovered the lost tapes for the unreleased '5th' Aurra album Satisfaction, originally recorded in 1984. The direction of the album was supervised by Steve Washington, Amuka Kelly (also known as Sheila Horne Washington), and Daniel Borine. In 2015  Family Groove Records released \"Body Rock\" album.\nIn 2019, Aurra's second album as Déjà, the long out of print Made to Be Together was released to digital and streaming platforms.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== as Aurra ===\n\n\n==== Albums ====\n\n\n==== Singles ====\n\n\n==== Compilations ====\n1991: The Best of Aurra (Rams Horn Records)\n1996: Anthology (CNR Music)\n1999: Greatest Hits (Unidisc Music)\n\n\n=== as Déjà ===\n\n\n==== Albums ====\n\n\n==== Singles ====\n\n\n==== Compilations ====\n2003: Aurra / Déjà - Deja: Definitive Collection of Aurra - Salsoul & Virgin Years\n\n\n== See also ==\nSkyy (band)\nSlave (band)\nSalsoul Records\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAurra on AllMusic\nAurra at Discogs."

    "text": "Tear Ceremony is an American electronic and ambient band fronted by Todd Gautreau (Gauthreaux)that was active in the late 1990s.\nGautreau then changed his moniker to Sonogram as the music became less dark and more optimistic. \nGautreau then fronted the indie rock band Crushed Stars.\nAfter a SXSW appearance, Crushed Stars signed to Portland's Arena Rock Records. They returned to SXSW and CMJ the following year.\nCrushed Stars has worked with such producers as Stuart Sikes (Cat Power, White Stripes) and John  Congleton (The Walkmen, Modest Mouse)\nBoth Crushed Stars and Sonogram now record for Simulacra Records.\nGautreau returned to ambient music in 2014 with his new project Tapes and Topographies. In addition to several releases on Simulacra, Tapes and Topographies has released music on Past Inside the Present, Dronarivm, Whitelabrecs, Shimmering Moods and ROHS!\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAn Hourglass of Opals (Machinery Records)\nResin (Simulacra Records)\nFilm Decay (Simulacra Records)\nEmulsion (Simulacra Records)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

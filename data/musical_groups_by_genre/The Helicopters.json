    "text": "The Helicopters were a South African pop rock band active in the 1980s. They formed in 1981 in Vereeniging and were stylistically similar to the new wave bands Duran Duran and A Flock of Seagulls. Benjy Mudie signed the group to Warner Bros. Records in 1984, where they released one album and several singles; in 1987 they moved to Epic and released a second full-length before disbanding. The band scored several hit singles in South Africa, including \"Mysteries and Jealousy\". The group was a popular concert draw, able to fill stadiums in its home country.\nAfter the band's breakup, lead singer Bernard Binns moved to England, where he has released several solo albums.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\nLove Attack (1985, WEA)\nMysteries and Jealousies — 4:15\nIn Love — 3:32\nDon't Vanish, It's a Love Attack — 3:33\nNight Vision Girl — 3:46\nSay That Again — 2:56\nCome and Dance — 3:26\nKissing For Pleasure — 3:40\nOnly For You — 4:05\nMiles Apart — 4:45\nChased — 3:11\nIn the Flesh (1987, Epic)\nTelevision — 6:14\nWestern Skies — 4:46\nIn the Flesh — 4:43\nHi-Tech Man — 3:42\nWhisper Your Secret — 4:34\nTerror in the Attic — 5:27\nYesterday Was Never — 4:16\nTelevision Part II — 1:04\nWhat Affair EP (1988, Gallo)\nThe Best of The Helicopters (2002, RetroFresh)\nSingles\n\"Flying High\" (Klingel, 1981)\n\"Mysteries and Jealousy\" (Warner, 1984)\n\"Miles and Miles Apart\" (Warner, 1984)\n\"Kissing For Pleasure\" (Warner, 1984)\n\"Only for You\" (Warner, 1985)\n\"Come and Dance\" (Warner, 1985)\n\"I Wanna Live in Hollywood\" (Warner, 1986)\n\"Whisper Your Secret\" (1987, Epic)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscography"

    "text": "Lollipop is an Italian girl group formed in 2001 on the international television sensation Popstars (originated in New Zealand), a precursor to the Idols shows. They sing mainly in English although they recorded two songs in Italian. They enjoyed good success in their home country.\nIn spring 2004, the band announced they would no longer perform together, after being dropped by their record label.\nIn 2013, the group reunited as a quartet and started a first reunion with a new single: Ciao (Reload) and a comeback tour.\nIn 2017, the group reunited again, but as a trio. They released the single Ritmo Tribale in 2018 and began a promotional tour.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLollipop were an Italian group performing on the pop scene between 2001 and 2004. The members were Dominique Fidanza (Domy), Marcella Ovani (Marcellina), Marta Falcone, Roberta Ruiu and Veronica Rubino. They debuted with a single that stayed in singles chart many weeks, and in just its first four weeks it sold over 100,000 copies, an enormous success for a single in the Italian music market which is traditionally much more concentrated on album sales. They then released their debut album, Popstars, which spawned the follow-up single \"Don't Leave Me Now\" (number 9 on the single chart) and their third single \"When The Rain\",a ballad conceived for the Christmas market whose video was their first to be broadcast on MTV and reached No. 5 on TRL. The single charted in the Top 20. During the summer the group performed in many Italian discos and clubs with the Popstar 2001 Tour.\nIn March 2002 the group took part in the Sanremo Music Festival with their first song in Italian, \"Batte Forte\", after which they were highly criticized by the press, above all because of their poor live performance. The single was also included in the re-release of their first album, Popstars Remixed, featuring a second CD with the remixed versions of all their songs, \"Batte Forte\" included. During the summer of the same year, the group embarked on the Popstars 2002 Tour all over Italy.\nIn March 2003 they released their second single in Italian \"Credi A Me\", which was featured in the Italian-dubbed version of the Disney movie The Jungle Book 2.\nThe group decided to take a break and only in January 2004 released their second album Together, which spawned two singles \"Dreaming of love\" and the digital single \"You\".

Throughout 2007 and 2008 she recorded her first solo album with songs in French and a couple in Italian.

After two promotional singles: \"Un papillon une étoile\" in 2011 and \"Oui ou Non\" in 2012, she finally released her first solo album Solipsiste in 2013.\nMarta Falcone released some solo songs on her official MySpace page in 2007.

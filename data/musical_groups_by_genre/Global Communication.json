    "text": "Global Communication is an electronic music duo consisting of Tom Middleton and Mark Pritchard; the duo have also recorded under other aliases, including Reload and Jedi Knights. They founded the labels Evolution Records and Universal Language Productions. Their 1994 album 76:14, released on Dedicated Records, became an acclaimed work of 1990s ambient and electronic music.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe duo's work as Global Communication focused on warmer rhythms and ambience in comparison to their recordings as Reload, which were eerie but danceable. They have also recorded as Jedi Knights, Secret Ingredients, The Chameleon, Link, and E621. The duo have produced remixes for various artists under each of their aliases, including a 1993 Reload remix of \"On\" by Aphex Twin and a 1997 Jedi Knights remix of \"Home\" by Depeche Mode. \nThey revived the Global Communication name in 2006 for the mix album Fabric 26.\nTheir song \"5:23\" features on the Grand Theft Auto 4 radio station The Journey.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nOriginal work as Global Communication\n\nKeongaku EP (1992)\n76:14 (1994)\nMaiden Voyage (2xEP) (1994)\nRemotion: The Global Communication Remix Album (1995)\nThe Way/The Deep EP (1996)\nThe Groove EP (1997)\nTransmissions Boxset (Pentamerous Metamorphosis, 76:14, Singles/Remixes/Curated Bonus Tracks, 3xCD/7xLP All Remastered) (2020)\nMixes as Global Communication\n\nPentamerous Metamorphosis (1993)\nFabric 26 (DJ Mix 1/2 by Mark Pritchard, 1/2 by Tom Middleton) (2006)\nBack In The Box (2xCD DJ Mix) (2011)\nAs Reload (at first, a Pritchard solo project, later including Middleton)\n\nReload EP (1992) – (Remaster/Reissue 2006)\nAuto-Reload EP (1992) – (Remaster/Reissue 2006)\nAmenity EP/Cyberdon EP (Reload Remixes) (1993) – (Cyberdon Remaster/Reissue: 2007)\nA Collection of Short Stories (1993)\nArchives EP (1997)\nAs Reload & E621\n\nAuto-Reload EP (1992)\nAuto-Reload EP Vol. 2 (1993)\nThe Biosphere EP (1993)\nEvolution Remaster/Reissue of Reload EP, Auto-Reload EP and The Biosphere EP (3x12\") (2006)\nAs Link & E621\n\nAntacid EP (1995)\nAs The Chameleon\n\nLinks EP (1995)\nAs Secret Ingredients\n\nNew York New York (1996)\nChicago Chicago (1996)\nAs Jedi Knights\n\nMay The Funk Be With You EP (1995)\nNew School Science (1996)\nThe Big Ones EP (1997)\nReturn of the Jedis (Promo) (1999)\nJedi Selector (2000)\nEvolution Records Compilation\n\nThe Theory of Evolution (1995)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nAs Global Communication\n\nMystic Institute: \"Ob-Selon Mi-Nos (Repainted By Global Communication\" (1993)\nReload & E621: \"The Biosphere (Global Communication Remix)\" (1993)\nLink: \"Arcadian (Global Communication Remix)\" (1994)\nWarp 69: \"Natural High (Global Communication Re-Take)\" (1994)\nNav Katze: \"Wild Horse (Global Mix Communication)\" (1994)\nThe Grid: \"Rollercoaster (The Global Communication Yellow Submarine Re-Take)\" (1994)\nPalmskin Productions: \"Evolution of The Beast (Part 2) (Global Communication Mix)\" (1994)\nSoft Ballet: \"Ride (Global Communication Dub Mix)\" (1995)\nJon Anderson: \"Bless This (Global Communication Mix)\" (1995)\nJon Anderson: \"Amor Real (Global Communication Mix)\" (1995)\nAzymuth: \"Jazz Carnival (Global Communication's Space Jazz Mix)\" (1996)\nPJ Harvey & John Parish: \"Civil War Correspondent (Global Communication Mix)\" (1996)\nSensorama: \"Aspirin (Global Communication Remix)\" (1996)\nLamb: \"Gorecki (Global Communication Mix)\" (1997)\nDusky: \"Skin Deep (Global Communication Remix & Global Communication Dub)\" (2015)\nAs Reload\n\nMystic Institute: \"QA-752L-P (Reload Remix)\" (1993)\nMystic Institute: \"NS-581A-T (Reload Remix)\" (1993)\nSlowdive: \"In Mind (The Reload 147 Take)\" (1993)\nAphex Twin: \"On (Reload Remix)\" (1993)\nNav Katze: \"Crazy Dream (The Reload Retro 313 Future Memory Mix)\" (1994)\nConfusion: \"Drawing (Sound Sculpture by Reload)\" (1994)\nSchaft: \"Visual Cortex (The Reload Re-difinition)\" (1994)\nAs Jedi Knights\n\nLink & E621: \"Antacid (Jedi Knights Remix)\" (1995)\nBomb the Bass: \"Absorber (Jedi Knights Remixes 1 & 2)\" (1995)\nModel 500: \"The Flow (Jedi Knights Remix)\" (1995)\nNicolette: \"We Never Know (Jedi Knights Remix)\" (1995) (unreleased)\nDepeche Mode: \"Home (Jedi Knights Remix)\" (1997)\nLeftfield: \"Afrika Shox (Jedis Elastic Bass Remix)\" (1999)\nUnderworld: \"Jumbo (Jedis Electro Dub & Sugar Hit Remix)\" (1999)\nAs The Chameleon\n\nPalmskin Productions: \"Evolution of The Beast (Part 1) (The Chameleon Remix)\" (1994)\nLink: \"Amazon Amenity (The Chameleon Remix)\" (1995)\nAs Secret Ingredients\n\nGlobal Communication: \"The Way (Secret Ingredients Remix)\" (1996)\nThe Jedis: \"Disco Magic (Secret Ingredients Remix)\" (1999)\nAs Link & E621\n\nGlobal Communication: \"7:39 (Link & E621 Appliance of Science Mix)\" (1994)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ambient music artists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nReload official website Archived 20 December 2005 at the Wayback Machine\nGlobal Communication discography at Discogs \nInterview with Middleton and Pritchard on the history of Global Communication Archived 4 March 2016 at the Wayback Machine\nEvolution Records Shop"

    "text": "Juan Winans is an American singer/songwriter, music producer, and a third-generation member of the Winans family.\n\n\n== Family and early life ==\nJuan Winans was born in Detroit, MI on July 24. The second child of four (Carvin Jr., Deborah Joy Winans & Ian) born to Carvin Winans (b. 1958) and Deborah Kerr Winans. His paternal grandparents, David (April 20, 1934 – April 8, 2009) and Delores Winans (September 22, 1936) met each other in 1951, at the ages of 17 and 16 while singing in the Lemon Gospel Chorus. They married two years later; the marriage lasted nearly sixty years, producing ten children. Mom & Pop Winans, as they would come to be known, had seven sons, David Jr, Ronald, Carvin, Marvin ( Marvin Winans ), Michael, Daniel, Benjamin ( BeBe Winans ), then three daughters, Priscilla ( CeCe Winans ), Angelique, and Debra. Both David's father and grandfather were preachers in the Pentecostal church, and he himself raised his ten children in a strict religious home. They taught their children how to sing and they honed their skills performing quartet music at their great-grandfather's church. However, it was not until 1980 that Marvin, Carvin, Michael and Ronald were discovered by Andrae Crouch, who signed them to Light Records as The Winans.\nOn January 1, 1981, Juan's father, Carvin Winans along with three of his brothers released their debut album, Introducing The Winans, embarking on a career that would earn them five Grammy Awards and the title, First Family of Gospel music. In 1987 Juan's uncle and aunt, released their debut album and became internationally known as BeBe & CeCe Winans . Several years later, in 1993, his father's youngest siblings, Angie & Debbie Winans released their debut album.\n\n\n== Music career ==\n\n\n=== Winans Phase 2 ===\nIn the winter of 1997 the Winans were asked to compose and perform a theme song for a Detroit NBC affiliate. They approached their sons about recording the song with them. It was during this time that Juan first expressed an interest in pursuing music, stating in a 1999 interview for CCM magazine, \"I don't think I ever aspired to sing before we put this group together\". He, along with his older brother, Carvin and two cousins, Marvin Winans Jr and Michael Winans Jr., formed the group Winans Phase 2. In the following year they signed a record deal with Myrrh/Epic Records and began working on their debut album, entitled We Got Next, released in August 1999 with tracks from Rodney Jerkins, Narada Michael Walden, and Babyface. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Gospel Album's chart, and sold over 250,000 copies in the U.S. It was nominated for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album at the 42nd Grammy Awards. However they lost the award to Yolanda Adams . The group was also featured on several national television shows including The Oprah Winfrey Show, Donnie & Marie, Soul Train, and the Queen Latifah show. In the spring of 2000 the group performed to crowds in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Amsterdam, promoting the release of We Got Next. A 2002 40-city tour by the entire Winans Family marked the unexpected end of the group.\nJuan has never publicly spoken about why Winans Phase 2 never recorded again. However, former members Marvin and Michael have cited \"internal problems\", and \"not really wanting to be an artist\" as reasons for the group's breakup.\n\n\n=== 2003-2007 ===\nIn 2003 Winans returned to the studio to record background vocals for his uncle BeBe Winans Christmas album My Christmas Prayer. The following year he relocated to Nashville to concentrate on songwriting.\nLater in 2004, Juan is credited with singing background vocals on Michelle Williams album, Do You Know, and Smokie Norful's Nothing Without You.\nIn 2005 Winans, along with Babyface, provided backing vocals for the song \"I Said I Love You\" from the Kirk Whalum release The Songs of Babyface. He is also credited with singing and arranging background vocals on George Huff's, My Christmas EP. During this time Winans began attending Bethel World Outreach Church in Nashville, TN, where he led worship service for the next four years.\n\n\n=== Since 2008–present ===\nIn 2008 Winans co-wrote the song Seattle for Gospel/R&B duo Mary Mary for their platinum selling fourth studio release The Sound. The album proved to be their best charting album to date, debuting No. 7 on the Billboard 200, No. 2 on the US R&B chart, and topping the Gospel and Contemporary Christian Music charts. The album held the No. 1 position on the Billboard Gospel Albums chart for over six months after its release. Winans also collaborated with Hip-Hop legend Heavy D on his critically acclaimed, Grammy nominated album, Vibes, co-writing and singing background vocals for the song No Matter What .\nThe following year Winans composed the lyrics for and produced the song Need You To Fall for Michael Bolton.

    "text": "VCR is an American punk rock band with synthpop leanings. The band formed in November 2002 in Richmond, Virginia, with a relatively unique lineup of a drummer, a bassist, and three synthesizer players.\nThe band released their debut, self-titled EP on Richmond-based label Pop Faction in 2003. The release was limited to roughly 1000 copies. After no touring, the band was signed by SideOneDummy Records in 2005. The label re-released the band's debut EP with a slightly altered track listing that year. In 2006, the band released their first full-length album, Power Destiny.\nIn 2007 the band played their last show. In 2011 the Misfits Cassette was re-released on vinyl by Riot Style Records.\n\n\n== Lineup ==\nChad Middleton – vocals, synthesizer, sampler\nStephen Smith – bass\nMya Anitai – vocals, synthesizer\nCasey Tomlin – synthesizer\nChristian Newby – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nVCR (EP) (2003, Pop Faction Records; Re-released in 2005 by SideOneDummy)\nPower Destiny (2006, SideOneDummy)\nMisfits Cassette Tape (2006, Ctrl+C Ctrl+V)\n\n\n=== Featured on ===\nv/a – Atticus...

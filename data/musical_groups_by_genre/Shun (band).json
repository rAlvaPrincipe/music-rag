    "text": "Shun (旬, later known as Syun) was a Japanese experimental sampling unit created by Susumu Hirasawa. The group was active from 1983 to 1987, although it was never officially ended, and was revived by Hirasawa in 1994 to 1996.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1983, Susumu Hirasawa's band P-Model had their Another Game album delayed four months by their label Tokuma Japan Communications, who demanded the group redo the lyrics of the song \"Atom-Siberia\", claiming they encouraged discrimination. After this, P-Model broke their contract with Tokuma and created the \"Another Act\" project, where the group would release records with compositions made independently by each member in styles different from P-Model. Hirasawa's releases were made under the name Shun, experimental in nature and featuring heavier use of Hirasawa's homemade sampler, the Heavenizer.\nAfter the fourth Shun album in 1987, the project was put into dormancy until 1994, when Hirasawa re-branded it as Syun, a label to release some of his less commercial works. The same year Syun released Landscapes, an ambient album featuring sounds created by the Vista landscape design software for the Amiga. In 1996, Syun released the Thai-inspired Kun Mae on a Calculation. No more albums were released under the Shun/Syun name after 1996, although Hirasawa continued to use the sounds that originated in Syun albums, most notably in his soundtracks for the adaptations of Berserk and the works of Satoshi Kon.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Members ==\nSusumu Hirasawa – All releases\nAkiro \"Kamio\" Arishima – shun and Landscapes\nAkemi Tsujitani – shun\nIwao Asama – shun\nYuji Matsuda – SHUN 2nd, SHUN IIIrd SHEETS and SHUN・4\nTeruo Nakano – SHUN 2nd\nHiromi Seki – SHUN・4\nShuichi Sugawara – SHUN・4\nShigeo Motojima – SHUN・4\nThe oldman, who was on the way to IWATE. – SHUN・4\nMotohiro Yamada – Landscapes\nSacol Trakranprasirt – Kun Mae on a Calculation\nSupat Kuntatun – Kun Mae on a Calculation\nYūichi Hirasawa – SHUN・4 VISION (except SHUN・II)\nHiroshi Moriguchi – SHUN・4 VISION (SHUN・II only)\nKiyoshi Inagaki – SHUN・4 VISION (\"GRAPHIX\")\n\n\n== External links ==\nSHUN/SYUN Discography at NO ROOM – The official site of Susumu Hirasawa (P-MODEL)\nShun at Discogs\nShun at Rate Your Music\n旬 at MusicBrainz\nJapanese Hirasawa fansite (lists Shun/Syun releases and advertisements)\nJapanese Hirasawa encyclopedia (list relationships between songs of the Shun/Syun albums and other Hirasawa songs)\nHirasawa fansite in English (talks a bit about Shun/Syun)"

    "text": "The Smetana Quartet (Czech: Smetanovo kvarteto) was a Czech string quartet that was in existence from 1943 to 1989, although it was known as the Smetana Quartet only from 1945 onwards.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n1st violin\n\nVáclav Neumann (1920-1995), from 1943 to 1945\nJaroslav Rybenský, from 1945 to 1947\nJiří Novák (1924-2010), since 1947\n2nd violin\n\nLubomír Kostecký (1922-2003)\nViola\n\nJiří Neumann, from 1943 to 1945\nVáclav Neumann, from 1945 to 1947\nJaroslav Rybenský, from 1947 to 1956\nMilan Škampa (1928-2018), since 1956\nCello\n\nAntonín Kohout (1919-2013)\n\n\n== Origins and activities ==\nThe Smetana Quartet arose from the Quartet of the Czech Conservatory, which was founded in 1943 (during the Nazi occupation) in Prague by Antonín Kohout, the cellist. With Jaroslav Rybenský and Lubomír Kostecký as first and second violins, and Václav Neumann as violist, the group gave its first performance as the Smetana Quartet on 6 November 1945, at the Municipal Library in Prague. Neumann left to pursue conducting in 1947, at which point Rybenský went to the viola desk and Jiří Novák (who shared first violin desk with Josef Vlach, founder of the Vlach Quartet, under Vaclav Talich in the Czech Chamber Orchestra) came in as first violin.\nBy 1949 the group had official connections with the Czech Philharmonic. The first foreign tour was in 1949, to Poland, and the first recording was of the second quartet by Bedřich Smetana in 1950. Rybenský was obliged to retire after ill health in 1952, and was replaced by Milan Škampa. The performers were appointed professors at the Academy of Musical Arts in 1967. Of their many recordings, those made at that time for German Electrola are considered particularly fine.\nFor many years this group, which has been called the finest Czech quartet of its time, played the Czech repertoire from memory, giving these works a special intensity and intimacy.\nThe Smetana Quartet made the third commercial digital recording ever made, Mozart's K.421 and K.458, in Tokyo April 24–26, 1972. They re-recorded the same repertoire ten years later in Prague.\nAntonín Kohout trained the Kocian Quartet (founded 1972) and the Martinů Quartet (1976), though the latter's members had been pupils of Professor Viktor Moučka, cellist of the Vlach Quartet.\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscographyá\nThe Smetana Quartet website -  rich photogallery, repertoire, records\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nNotes\n\nBibliography\nVladimír Šefl, Smetanovo Kvarteto (Supraphon, 1974)\nJirǐ Berkovec, The Smetana Quartet (Orbis 1956)"

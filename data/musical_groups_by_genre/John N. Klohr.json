    "text": "John Nicholas Klohr (July 27, 1869 â€“ February 17, 1956) was a composer of band music. Klohr was born in Cincinnati, Ohio.  A graduate of the Cincinnati public schools, Klohr set upon a career in music, especially vaudeville. He was a vaudeville trombonist by trade, but also performed as a member of Cincinnati's musical life. He played in the Syrian Temple Shrine Band, led by fellow composer Henry Fillmore. From 1921 to 1926, Klohr was a trombonist in Henry Fillmore's concert band. He was a member of the Syrian Temple for over 50 years, as well as a member of the Knights of Pythias and the Fraternal Order of Eagles. Klohr was also an early member of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers and worked as editor of the band and orchestra department of the John Church Company, a music publisher in Cincinnati. Klohr died of a heart attack in 1956, and was buried at St. Joseph Cemetery in Cincinnati.\n\n\n== Compositions ==\nNames in parentheses are publishers and copyright dates\n\n\n== References ==\nGeiger, Loren: Boombah Herald, Lancaster, NY 1974\nRehrig, William H and Paul E.

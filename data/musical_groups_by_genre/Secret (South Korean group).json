Sonamoo member New Sun also took part in composing the track Look At Me which is featured on the album.\n\n\n=== 2015–2018: Members departure, legal disputes with TS and presumed disbandment ===\nOn September 26, 2016, it was announced that Sunhwa would be leaving the group after deciding not to renew her contract with TS Entertainment in order to pursue a career in acting. Sunhwa's contract with TS Entertainment was terminated on October 13. The group would continue with the remaining three members.\nOn February 28, 2018 it was reported that Hyoseong and Jieun were in legal disputes with TS Entertainment. Hyoseong's legal disputes with TS is due to issues such as not receiving payments. It was also reported that in August 2017, Jieun submitted a request to the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board to verify that her contract is no longer valid due to TS Entertainment not following the terms of the contract.\nJieun later announced via Instagram that she was no longer a member of Secret as her contract was violated and no longer exists.\nOn March 5, Hyoseong's lawyer revealed that she had filed a civil lawsuit against TS Entertainment in September 2017 to confirm that her contract with the agency is no longer valid. Hyoseong's lawyer stated “First, there are payments that Jun Hyo-seong has not received. TS Entertainment also transferred the management rights conferred by its exclusive contract with the singer to another party without the consent of Jun Hyoseong herself. Not only is this a clear violation of her contract, but it is also a source of instability in her promotions as a singer.” He also stated that it would be unlikely of Hyoseong to remain a member of Secret while under TS Entertainment given the situation and the lack of trust and communication between the agency and Hyoseong, effectively ending the group.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Musical styles and theme ===\nRetro is the main musical style of the majority of Secret's singles, although the group has channeled other genres such as pop, dance, R&B, and hip-hop. Secret were originally formed with an intention to be an RnB and Hip-Hop group as seen in their debut single, \"I Want You Back\". As Seoulbeats wrote,  \"Originally debuting with an urban RnB concept, the girls of Secret have transformed themselves into the queens of retro ever since their breakthrough hits with “Magic” and “Madonna”. Furthermore, with Wonder Girls recently vacating their long-held affair with retro in favor of a more fresh and futuristic(?) approach, Secret lays claim as the next best group to have established a retro identity.\"  Catherine Deen of Yahoo! Philippines said that the group is known \"for its unique ability to take retro music and make it their own.\" While reviewing \"Love is Move\", Park Hyunmin of enewsWorld commented that Secret is \"known for its pop-heavy beats and easy-to-follow dance moves\". Hyunmin further added that \"Secret's main appeal is its retro beat and sexy choreography\".\nSecret's output, particularly with their work with Kang Ji-won and Kim Ki-bum, makes use of live instruments such as brass, saxophones and drums with the incorporation of synthesizers and electric guitars. While reviewing \"Poison\", Seoulbeats commented that \"the composition [of \"Poison\"] contains a very fitting saxophone hook along with recognizable brass and drum instrumentals that have become the trademark of Secret and their in-house composers, Kang Ji-won and Kim Ki-bum, who have produced all of Secret's retro hits. Secret's secret formula for success lies not only in their determined execution of one particular style, but their consistent development of a concept that suits them very well.\" Seoulbeats concludes that \"Secret has carved out its conceptual niche in the K-pop market by developing a distinct and consistent style, and thus they are now in a position to elevate their success and recognition in the industry. While most other groups undergo drastic changes over time to keep current fans interested and to attract new fans, Secret clearly benefits from the advantages of continuity. What other groups or idols have carved out a stylistic niche over the years?\"\n\n\n=== Image ===\nSecret is also known for their transitions to cute and the girl-next-door image through songs like \"Shy Boy\" and \"Starlight Moonlight\" from the sexy and powerful image through \"Magic\", \"Madonna\" and \"Poison\" while still retaining retro as the main theme for their sound.  Although a commercial success with \"Magic\" and \"Madonna\" peaking at number two and number one respectively on the Gaon Charts, Secret failed to win a first place award on any televised South Korean weekly music shows such as M! Countdown, Music Bank and Inkigayo until \"Shy Boy\". Seoulbeats wrote, \"Secret embarked on an aegyo phase in their following release of “Shy Boy\" although with much voiced displeasure from the members. Despite the radical change in their personalities, their style remained consistent in staying with and expanding upon their retro identity. The song became a major success as Secret traded in their sex appeal for a heavy dose of aegyo, resulting in much hardware for their chart-topping song.\" Secret kept its cute imagery with their following single  \"Starlight Moonlight\" until the release of \"Love is Move\" and \"Poison\". During their promotions with \"Poison\", Jun Hyoseong commented \"Secret has always been known as a cute group that appeals to the general public. This time, however, we′ve escaped that and showed off our unique charms. Our visuals have also changed for the sexy.\"  Jun added, \"We′re actually closer to Shy Boy in real life.\"\n\n\n== Endorsements and other activities ==\n \nThe group's popularity and success in Korea has led to endorsement deals such as Gueoseu Chicken, Googims mall, Grand Mer(Online Fishing Game), Nike, Nene Chicken, Good Day Soju and Parkga among others. Sunhwa became more active in acting, modelling and frequently participating in variety shows. In 2009, she became a fixed cast on a popular variety show called Invincible Youth.\nIn December 2010, Secret and the Korean Non-Life Insurance Association (KNIA) teamed up to film a Commercial Film in a Gangnam studio to share their message of concern against drunk driving.

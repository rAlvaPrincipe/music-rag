    "text": "The Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra (BSO) is a symphony orchestra in the New York City metropolitan area.\nFounded in 1973, the orchestra plays concerts throughout the year at the Brooklyn Museum and other venues in Brooklyn and New York City. The BSO's interim artistic director is Felipe Tristan. Starting with the 2015–2016 season, BSO's assistant conductor was Felipe Tristan, who then was promoted to associate conductor starting on the 2018–2019 season. The BSO's repertoire spans from the early classics to modern and contemporary works.\nThe Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra rehearses at the Mark Morris Dance Center in downtown Brooklyn. For 37 years, the BSO performed at Saint Ann's Church in downtown Brooklyn, but in 2014 moved to their current performance space at the Brooklyn Museum. The change was intended to bring classical music to broader audience. In 2020, the BSO embarked on its first ever tour of Mexico, performing concerts at the Castillo de Chapultepec and at the Conservatorio Nacional de Música de México. During the 2023-2024 season, the BSO will celebrate its 50th anniversary with a series of special performances and presentations in Brooklyn as well as a trip to Mexico in February 2024.[1].\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

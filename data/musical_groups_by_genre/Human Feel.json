The group combines elements of free jazz, chamber music, and alternative rock and features extensive improvisation in their performances. Gary W. Kennedy noted their \"tight-knit interaction and exploratory style.\"\nHuman Feel was formed in 1987 when Speed, D'Angelo, and Black were studying music in Boston. Rosenwinkel joined in 1990. In the early 90s, the members relocated to New York City.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nHuman Feel (Human Use, 1989)\nScatter (GM, 1991)\nWelcome to Malpesta (New World, 1994)\nSpeak to It (Songlines, 1996)\nGalore (Skirl, 2007)\nGold (Intakt Records, 2019)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nParty Favor (Independent, 2016)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHuman Feel press"

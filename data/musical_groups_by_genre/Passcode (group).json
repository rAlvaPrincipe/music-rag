    "text": "Passcode (Japanese: パスコード, Hepburn: Pasukōdo, stylized as PassCode), is a Japanese metal idol group founded in 2013.\n\n\n== History ==\nPasscode was formed in Osaka in 2013 and consists of the four vocalists Nao Minami, Kaede Takashima, Emily Arima and Hinako Ōgami. Passcode is supported by a backup band.\nAfter releasing several singles and albums on smaller labels, the group signed to Universal Music Japan and released their second full-length album Zenith in 2017. In 2018 the band signed with British record label JPU Records and released a best-of record called Ex Libris Passcode in Europe.\nTheir song \"Ichika Bachika\" became the opening song for the second season of the live-action film adaption of Kakegurui. In June 2020, their ninth single \"Starry Sky\" debuted at number 1 on the Japanese Oricon weekly singles chart and the Billboard Japan Top Singles Sales chart, selling over 7,000 units in its first week after release.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe musical style of Passcode can be described as kawaii metal. Some vocalists use harsh vocals next to cleans. Yuna Imada contributed the harsh vocals before her retirement in 2021, with the job now handled by former Ladybaby member Emily Arima. Kaede Takashima uses the harsh vocals in some tracks like \"Taking You Out\" and \"Club Kids Never Die\". The band uses Auto-Tune while singing.\nThe band mixes metalcore with EDM and J-pop.

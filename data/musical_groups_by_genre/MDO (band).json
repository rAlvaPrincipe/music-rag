    "text": "MDO is a Latin American pop/rock band, spun off in 1997 from the Latin American boy band once known as Menudo. The group's first line-up reunited for an international tour in 2015.\n\n\n== Band history ==\nIn the mid-1990s, Edgardo Diaz, Menudo's creator and director, sold the rights for the trademarked name Menudo to a Panamanian company. After the release and promotion of Menudo's album Tiempo De Amar in 1996, the remaining line-up formed MDO under the direction and production of Diaz at first.\nThe members at the time were Abel Talamántez, Alexis Grullón, Anthony Galindo, Didier Hernández and Daniel René. Together they recorded the album MDO  in 1997 (Gold Record). In 1999, they followed it with Un Poco Más. The album featured two English songs, \"Groove With Me Tonight\" and \"Fantasy\", in an attempt to cross-over to the US market, this album hit Platinum in sales and took MDO to #1 in US Billboard Hot Latin Tracks. The same happened with 2000's Subir Al Cielo which featured two more English singles, also went Platinum on record sales and #1 in US Hot Latin Tracks from Billboard.\nThe next year, in 2001 MDO released their 1st English album titled Little Piece of Heaven, which was distributed internationally through Columbia Records. Taking the boy band to Asia on a 1-year tour,\nMDO decided to take a break from the industry.\nIn mid-2004, it was announced that MDO would return with new members. Three of the new members (Daniel Rodríguez, Elliot Suro, and Luis Montes) were contestants from the first season of Puerto Rican reality/talent show Objetivo Fama with a fourth member, Lorenzo Duarte, to complete the line-up. Their first album was titled Otra Vez and the title single proved to be a successful hit. The group toured through Latin America and were nominated for several awards.\nIn 2007, the band returned with a new, more mature look, with the members playing instruments as opposed to Menudo's style of singing and dancing. Their final album, Sabe A Tí was released on February 12, 2008.\nIn 2011,  five original band members reunited for an international tour for Puerto Rico, Central and South America. The band released a new single titled \"Ya no queda más\". \nIn 2015, Pablo Portillo and Lorenzo Duarte also toured with them on a celebration tour along with former Menudo member Ashley Ruiz as a special guest. \nIn 2017 MDO formed part of the 90s Pop Tour and a live DVD was released through Sony Music and went Gold within hours of release.\nIn 2018 the \" MDO is back\" tour took place and as a result the band would release a new single with music video fall 2018. Enamorao was to be the comeback of the Latin sensation.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n== After MDO (2003-present) ==\nSome of MDO's former members have continued with their musical careers:\n\nDaniel René Weider started a solo career in 2003.\nAbel Talamántez is currently a member of Los Kumbia Kings/Super Reyes.\nPablo Portillo started a solo career.\nAnthony Galindo reunited with former Menudo members to form Menudo: La Reunion and toured Latin America with them.

    "text": "The Kairos Quartet is a Berlin-based string quartet founded in 1996.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Kairos Quartet (initially \"work in progress quartet\") specialises in music from 1950 onwards. At the time of its foundation in 1996 it was the first string quartet with such an orientation in the German-speaking world. It is named after Kairos, in Greek mythology the god of the favourable moment and the embodiment of the subjective concept of time. The quartet made its debut at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in Darmstadt in 1996, where it was also taught by the primarius of the Arditti Quartet. \nIt has since collaborated with many composers, including Georg Friedrich Haas, György Kurtág, Helmut Lachenmann, Liza Lim, Sergej Newski, Enno Poppe, Wolfgang Rihm and Marco Stroppa. The Kairos Quartet frequently performs at Neue Musik festivals in Europe and Mexico. In 2018, the quartet made its debut in China with a concert and several workshops at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. Subsequently the quartet also went to Guangzhou and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia, performed Unsuk Chin's string quartet at Elbphilharmonie Hamburg and had its first performance in Rome. Its repertoire now includes nearly 300 compositions, including around 100 premieres and commissioned works.\nThe Kairos Quartet is also actively involved in teaching Neue Musik, among others at the Zurich University of the Arts, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the Universität Mozarteum Salzburg, the Shanghai Conservatory, the Xinghai Conservatory in Guangzhou, and the Berlin University of the Arts. It sets its own accents through self-organised concerts, alternative concert formats and concert series.\n\n\n== Members ==\nRui Cardoso Antunes, violin (9/2022-2023: Delia Ramos Rodrigues, 1/2022-8/2022: Veronika Paleeva, 9/2021–12/2021: Daniella Strasfogel, 1996-2021: Wolfgang Bender)\nAlexa Renger, violin (1/2022-8/2022: Alicja Pilarczyk, 2008–2021: Stefan Häussler, 6/2007–5/2008: Susanne Zapf, 1997–2007: Chatschatur Kanajan, 1996–1997: Kathrein Allenberg)\nSimone Heilgendorff, viola\nClaudius von Wrochem, violoncello\nThe violins alternate in the function of the first violin.\n\n\n== Prizes and scholarships ==\nKranichstein Scholarship\nGerman Record Critics' Prize 1/2005.\nComposition commissions from the Berlin Senate.\nConcerts of the German Music Council\nScholarship holder of the Akademie Schloss Solitude 2000/2001 (as first ensemble)\nSponsorship awards from the Ernst von Siemens Foundation\nProject funding by the Hauptstadtkulturfonds\nProject funding by the Foundation Deutsche Klassenlotterie Berlin\nEnsemble funding by the Senate of Berlin\nEnsemble funding by Deutsche Musikrat: NEUSTART for ensembles and bands\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nPortrait of the Kairos Quartet at Edition Zeitklang\nGeorg Friedrich Haas: String Quartets 1 and 2 at Edition Zeitklang\nPortrait of the composer Viera Janarcekova at ProViva\nPortrait of the composer Enno Poppe at col legno\n\"Wider den Strich\" (Musik in Deutschland 1950-2000 among others Orm Finnendahl Fälschung for string quartet, laptop, ghetto blaster and live electronics (2003) at Red Seal\nComposer portrait Jay Schwartz at Wergo (German Music Council).\nComposer portrait Knut Müller: \"Chamber Music\" with Thorn [1996] (1st string quartet, recording from 2001, EZ), Zeug [1999] (2nd string quartet)2012 Edition Zeitklang\n\"Klangnarbe\" - composer portrait Marina Khorkova a. a.

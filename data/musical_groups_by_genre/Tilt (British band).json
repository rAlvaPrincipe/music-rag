    "text": "Tilt is an English group of electronic record producers, composed of Mick Park and Nic Britton.\nFormed in Coventry, by Mick Park and Mick Wilson in 1990, they became residents at The Eclipse, the first legal all night rave venue in the UK.  Their time at Eclipse was inspirational, playing alongside Sasha, and motivating the boys to produce their own musical material.  \nIn 1993, they met with John Graham and Tilt was formed. 3 years later, out of their studios in Stoke-on-Trent, their first hit single  \"I Dream\", released on Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto Records.  \nAfter multiple successful singles including \"My Spirit\", \"Places\", and the captivating \"Butterfly\", along with \"Rendezvous\", which they recorded with Paul van Dyk, they saw themselves signed to Hooj Choons, the label of dance labels in that era.\nThe Hooj Choons label released \"Invisible\", Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart.  The unforgettable & timeless cover version of Robert Miles' \"Children\" and their \"Dark Science EP\" and at this point had reckoned seven UK chart hits.\nIn 1997, the boys collaborated with the legendary Sex Pistols Manager Malcolm McLaren on  Lakme 'The Bell Song' - which received critical acclaim. Graham left Tilt in 1999 to pursue his solo career and Parks and Wilson continued to release singles until joined by Andy Moor which saw the release of the album, Explorer, on  Hooj Choons subsidiary label, Lost Language. \nMoor and Wilson subsequently left the band to pursue their own paths and in 2011, Nic Britton re-joined Mick Park as TILT with releases on Black Hole Recordings.\nThe production of ‘No Other Day’ featured Maria Nayler (\"Angry Skies\" & \"Headstrong\") and re-released the Oakey favourite \"The World Doesn’t Know\" for Lost Language’s 100th release. \nMick Park and Nic Britton the celebrated their huge remix of Cosmos \"Take Me With You\" supported by BBC Radio One and Kiss (UK radio station) and have since collaborated with Ben Shaw, Sam Mollison and Dominique Atkins (aka) 'Grace' and have released productions on Mesmeric Records, Black Hole Recordings, Perfecto Records, Pro B-Tech and Lost Language all being championed from a plethora of DJ's including Carl Cox, John Digweed, Hernan Cattaneo, Nick Warren, Paul Oakenfold & Pete Tong to name a few! \nAfter releasing their 'Best Of' album \"Stop The World Revolving\", 2014 was a flurry of activity.

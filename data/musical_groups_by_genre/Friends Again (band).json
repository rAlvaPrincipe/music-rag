McGurk and McGowan left the band in 1982. Shortly after, James Grant (guitar, vocals) and Stuart Kerr (drums) joined the band to complete the line-up.  The group were known for their singles \"State of Art\", \"Sunkissed\" and \"Honey at the Core\". They released a self-titled EP in 1984, which peaked at No. 59 on the UK Singles Chart.

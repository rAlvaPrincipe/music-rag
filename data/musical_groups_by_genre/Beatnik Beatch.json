They also featured keyboardist Se Padilla, later replaced by Roger Manning.\nIn 1987, they released At The Zula Pool, under the San Francisco based indie label Industrial Records.  It was re-released with 5 tracks removed and 4 tracks added after the band was signed by Atlantic Records in 1988. Around this time Manning joined the band.\nAfter Beatnik Beatch disbanded early in 1989, Sturmer and Manning formed Jellyfish.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nAt the Zula Pool - (Industrial) 1987\nBeatnik Beatch - (Atlantic) 1988\nSingle\n\n\"Beatnik Beatch\" - 1988\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBeginnings & Beatniks - More information at Dummyhead Central\nBeatnik Beatch at AllMusic"

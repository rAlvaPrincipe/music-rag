    "text": "Will Powers was the stage name used by celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith when she created a self-help comedy music album.    The 1983 album, entitled Dancing for Mental Health, used affirmations set to music to poke fun at the self-help entrepreneurs who \"build the listener's inner self and encourage personal growth through the thought that anything is possible\". Will Powers is portrayed by Goldsmith during the spoken word sections as well as in the sung sections, her voice shifted downward in pitch to sound male. \nKey musical collaborators were Jacob Brackman and Steve Winwood. Additional contributors to the recording included Sting, Nile Rodgers, Todd Rundgren, Carly Simon and Tom Bailey. The album Dancing for Mental Health produced two hit singles, \"Kissing With Confidence\" and \"Smile\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nDancing for Mental Health\n\"Adventures in Success\" (Goldsmith, Sting)\n\"Dancing for Mental Health\" (Jacob Brackman, Goldsmith, Stevie Winwood)\n\"Opportunity\" (Brackman, Goldsmith, Winwood)\n\"Kissing with Confidence\" (Brackman, Goldsmith, Nile Rodgers, Todd Rundgren, Winwood)\n\"Will Powers\" (Brackman, Goldsmith, Winwood)\n\"All Thru History\" (Tom Bailey, Brackman, Goldsmith, Winwood)\n\"Happy Birthday\" (Brackman, Goldsmith, Winwood)\n\"Smile\" (Brackman, Goldsmith, Rodgers)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nThree singles were released - \"Kissing With Confidence\", \"Adventures in Success\" and \"Smile\".\nThe album credits \"special thanks\" to Steve Winwood, Todd Rundgren, Sting, Nile Rodgers, Carly Simon, Sly and Robbie, Jacob Brackman and the Will Powers Supporters: Chris Blackwell, Ellen and Pascual Nieves, Ellen Foley, Andy Cavaliere, Donna Hellman, Bashiri Johnson, Mary Beth Hurt, Maria Vidal Fernandez, Meatloaf, David Sanborn, Steve Stanley, Griffin Dunne, Karen Allen, Warren Beatty, Glenn Close, Ian Hunter and Tom Bailey.\nMixed by Todd Rundgren, \"Kissing With Confidence\" was released as a single in the UK, peaking at No. 17 in the UK Singles Chart.

    "text": "Red Zebra is a Belgian post-punk group from Bruges.\nThey started at the end of the 1970s and have the following members: Peter Slabbynck (vocals), Geert Maertens (lead guitar), Vincent Hallez (second guitar and bass guitar) and Johan Isselee (drums). In 1980 they had their biggest hit I Can't Live In A Living room, today still a punk classic. The group still exists and also has a related project today, namely The John Lennon Rifle Club. On 6 December 2010, it was announced that the cooperation between singer Peter Slabbynck and the other members of the group was stopped. They announced this on their page on Myspace. In 2017 they reformed.\nTheir song \"I Can't Live in a Living Room\" was used in Asia Argento's 2014 film Incompresa (English title Misunderstood).\n\n\n== Discography ==\nI Can't Live In A Living Room\nTV Activity\nBastogne\nLust\nPolar Club\nMaquis\nAlways\nFrom Ape To Zebra (Parsifal)\nA Red Zebra Is Not A Dead Zebra\nSanitized For Your Protection\nMimicry\nJohn Wayne\nLast Band Standing\nDon't Put Your Head In A Bucket (Parsifal)\nPunks Don't Have Barbecues\nBlue Nothing Day\nThe Art Of Conversation\nKookaburra\nSpit On The City\nI Got The Microphone\nLive In Front Of A Nation\nNo Kitchen In The House\nGraveyard Shuffle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMyspace"

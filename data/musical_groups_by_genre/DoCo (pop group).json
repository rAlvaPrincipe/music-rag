    "text": "DoCo is a pop group composed of five female Ranma ½ voice actresses. The performances are done in-character. DoCo has released three albums: DoCo★First, DoCo☆Second, and DoCo Original Karaoke. Some of the songs were translated and performed in English by DoCo U.S.A., the corresponding English language voice actors. Some of their songs were used as the opening and ending themes for the Ranma ½ OVA, as well as in music videos that accompanied the OVAs. A few songs (such as the DoCo version of CoCo's \"Equal Romance\") also appear on various Ranma ½ musical albums.\nDoCo is in some sense a parody of CoCo. As \"CoCo\" can be taken to mean ここ (koko, here), \"DoCo\" can be taken to mean どこ (doko, where?).\n\n\n== Members ==\nMegumi Hayashibara, as female Ranma\nNoriko Hidaka, as Akane Tendo\nMinami Takayama, as Nabiki Tendo\nKikuko Inoue, as Kasumi Tendo\nRei Sakuma, as Shampoo\nDoCo U.S.A.\n\nRose Hastreiter, as female Ranma\nTanya Hancheroff, as Akane Tendo\nSaffron Henderson, as Nabiki Tendo\nWillow Johnson, as Kasumi Tendo\nCathy Weseluck, as Shampoo\nBefore becoming a voice actress, Hidaka got her start in the 1980s as a tarento and pop singer.

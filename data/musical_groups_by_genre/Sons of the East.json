    "text": "Sons of the East are an Australian indie folk trio formed in 2011 by Nic Johnston, Dan Wallage, and Jack Rollins. To date, they have released one studio album, three EPs, and a number of singles. The trio has performed at Latitude Festival, SXSW, Colours of Ostrava, and Boardmasters Festival, among other international festivals.\n\n\n== History ==\nSons of the East released their debut self-titled EP in August 2013, with the leading single \"Come Away\". In November 2015, they released another EP, Already Gone.\nTheir third release, the EP Burn Right Through, came out in 2019 and featured the singles \"Nothing Comes Easy\", \"Silver Lining\", and \"It Must Be Luck\". ABC's Dan Condon said of the single, \"It Must Be Luck is a guaranteed starter on just about every wedding playlist from here on in\", while describing the band as a \"rootsy, uber-chilled group with really close-knit harmonies and really strong, pretty songs.\"\nIn September 2022, the band released their first full-length studio album, Palomar Parade, stating, \"Palomar Parade is all of our favourite songs written over the last two years... Some came to us in a day, some came to us over the course of a year, but all of them shone in the sometimes-brutal process of making a record.\" Clunk magazine's Luke James gave the album a 4.5 star review, stating, \"‘Palomar Parade’ is a beautiful album that feels like a classic rather than a debut. With hints of Van Morrison, Bob Dylan and Garth Brooks, the blend of folk and country sounds equal parts grand and intimate.\" The band released a deluxe version of Palomar Parade in April 2023, featuring three new songs, including the single \"Ain't So Easy\".\nOn 14 July 2023, Sons of the East issued their first standalone single of the year, \"Hard to Tell\". To promote it, the band undertook a forty-date tour across Europe and North America. While on tour in October of the same year, they released another single, \"Head Above the Water\", announcing with it a thirty-date Australian headline tour for 2024.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\n\n== References =="

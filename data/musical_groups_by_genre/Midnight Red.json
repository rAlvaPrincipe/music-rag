The group was signed to RedOne's 2101 Records and to Capitol.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2009–12: Formation and beginning ===\nMidnight Red was originally formed by Eric Secharia, Anthony Ladao, and Thomas Augusto. Secharia and Augusto auditioned for the 2007 rebirth of popular boy band Menudo. The group recruited Joey Diggs Jr. from a referral by a fellow producer, while Colton Rudloff was found on YouTube. In 2009, after relocating to California, the group formed FLYTE.\nThe group caught the eye of one of the music producers of RedOne, who worked with Akon, Lady Gaga, Pitbull,  and Jennifer Lopez, among other artists. Once signed to Interscope Records, the group renamed itself  Midnight Red. In the video for \"Body Talk\", Augusto says \"Midnight is that time that everyone wants to sneak out and party, and red is a very dominant, 'in your face' color and it represents what Midnight Red wants to do with its music.\"\nRed is also part of their name, in honor of REDone.\nIn the spring of 2011, Interscope released Midnight Red's self-titled EP on iTunes. The EP featured their first song \"One Club at a Time\", which was used for FOX's So You Think You Can Dance for National Dance Day, as well as a cover of \"Step by Step\" by New Kids on the Block.\nThe group received rave reviews as the opening act on the NKOTBSB Tour in the summer of 2011. After the tour the group flew to Paris in December 2011 to continue recording material for their debut album. The group performed for many events including Larry King's \"Guard a Heart\" Pre Grammy Performance, opening for Carly Rae Jepsen at Universal City Walk, and Young Hollywood-Uneeqability.

In 2014, the band was chosen as Elvis Duran's Artist of the Month and appeared on NBC's Today show with Hoda Kotb and Kathy Lee Gifford performing \"Take Me Home\".

This tour consisted of stops across the eastern United States in 10 cities and other acts included Becky G and W3 The Future.\nOn March 27, 2015, Joey Diggs announced his departure from the group, citing that \"happiness\" and \"trust\" come first for him in order to \"see growth\" that he desires to see in his life.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nColton Rudloff, born 17 January 1989 in Buffalo, New York.

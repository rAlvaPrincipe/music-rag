    "text": "The Strub-Quartett was a well-known German string quartet from Berlin (1929–1945) and Detmold (1945–1965), named after primarius Max Strub.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first Strub Quartet was formed from the chamber orchestra of Edwin Fischer and was supported by the Swiss pianist.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the Strub Quartet had a decisive influence on the German string quartet scene. From the late 1930s, the Strub Quartet, together with the Gewandhaus Quartet were responsible with the Chamber Trio for early music and the Gewandhaus Chamber Orchestra and the chamber music evenings at the Leipzig Gewandhaus. Concert tours took the ensemble through Germany as well as to other European countries such as Italy, Austria, France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The string quartet performed repeatedly in Milan since 1939, first at the Conservatorio Giuseppe Verdi, then in 1949 in the auditorium of Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore and in 1951 in the Teatro Excelsior. During the Second World War (1 to 4 June 1943) the quartet also gave  Nazi propaganda concerts in occupied France (Bordeaux, Poitiers and Angers).\nIn 1940 he became an honorary member of the Società del quartetto di Milano and in 1942 of the association Beethoven House Bonn. In 1952 it was invited to the Beethoven celebration. The string quartet also received a special audience with Pope Pius XII in the Vatican. The 1951/52 season was preceded by the Beethoven cycle in Munich and Stuttgart, and later by all of the composer's string quartets in the Mozarteum in Salzburg and in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. Furthermore, the quartet gave concerts in the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMax Strub (1929-1965) was a member of the string quartet throughout his life as primarius (1st violin). At his side were Josef Krips (1929–1933), Jost Raba (1934–1938), Hermann Hubl (1939–1951), Otto Schad (1951–1953) und Ruth Wagner-Nielen (1953–1965) as 2. violin, Rudolph Nel (1929–1933), Walter Trampler (1934–1938), Hermann Hirschfelder (1939–1951), Franz Beyer (1951–1953 and 1962–1965), and Walter Müller (1953–1962) as violist and Hans Schrader (1929–1933), Ludwig Hoelscher (1934–1938), Hans Münch-Holland (1939–1953) and Irene Güdel (1953–1965) as violoncellist.\n\n\n== Repertoire ==\nThe Strub Quartet was specialised in the classical and Romantic repertoire as well as more modern music, for example by Max Reger and Paul Hindemith. It was responsible for the premiere of string quartets by Karl Höller (op. 24), Hans Pfitzner (op. 50), Lothar Windsperger and Johannes Driessler (op. 41/1) The string quartet also participated in the world premiere of the string quintet by  Anton Bruckner arranged by Armin Knab.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nLudwig van Beethoven: String Quartet No. 9, C major, op. 59/3 (Electrola 1941)\nAnton Bruckner: String quintet, F major, WAB 112 (Electrola 1940 ?, Pristine Audio 2017)\nAntonín Dvořák: Finale, from the String quartet in F-Dur, op. 96 American Quartet (Bertelsmann Schallplattenring 1959)\nJoseph Haydn: Variations: String quartet in C major, op. 76/3, Hob.

    "text": "Sakura Gakuin (Japanese: さくら学院, lit. 'Cherry Blossom Academy') was a Japanese idol girl group formed in 2010 by the Amuse talent agency. The group's membership fell within the age range of Japanese compulsory education, typically containing between 10 and 12 members at a time who fall between the ages of 10 and 15. With the theme of school life and extracurricular club activities, when the academic year ends at the end of March, the group released an annual studio album, new members \"transferred in\" to the group, and others who finish compulsory education \"graduated\", or left.\nMembers of the group also belonged to one or more of its sub-units, which are modeled after school extracurricular clubs. Each club performed with its own theme and musical genre, and their music may be included in the main group's albums or released as a separate single.\nThe group disbanded on August 31, 2021.\n\n\n== Concept ==\nThe group functioned as a \"unit limited to the growing period\" (成長期限定ユニット, seichō-ki gentei yunitto), typically containing between 10 and 12 members at a time who fall between the ages of 10 and 15, and therefore are between fifth and ninth grade. The group was themed around the idea of school life and extracurricular activities, featuring a \"principal\", Mitsuru Kuramoto (倉本美津留), \"teacher\" Hayashi Mori (森ハヤシ, often referred to as \"Mori-sensei\"), and sub-units designated as \"clubs\". The group released an album annually in mid-March, the month marking the end of the academic year (年度, nendo), leading to a concert at the end of the month in which the most senior members \"graduate\", or leave, in accordance with having finished their compulsory education. Each May, new members from lower grades \"transferred in\" to the group.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: Beginnings and Message ===\nSakura Gakuin was created around April 2010 by the talent agency Amuse.

Since the group's theme was that of an elementary and junior high school, when a member graduated from junior high, specifically her third year, she would leave Sakura Gakuin as well, during a ceremony the group held around the end of the Japanese school year (late March) in which these members would \"graduate\".\nAt the time of the group's disbandment, the group consisted of the following eight members.\nNote: Names presented here are in Western format (i.e. given name followed by family name) as opposed to Japanese name.\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nMembers that leave Sakura Gakuin also complete ninth grade education in school, and are considered \"graduated\".\n\n\n=== Member timeline ===\n\n\n== Sub-units ==\nThe sub-units of the group were described as extra-curricular activities, each with its own theme and genre. For example, the Heavy Music Club Babymetal performed music which combined J-pop and heavy metal and wears Gothic Lolita outfits; the Go Home Club Sleepiece performed live wearing pajamas, with light choreography invoking movements during sleep; and the Science Club Kagaku Kyumei Kikoh Logica?, which members perform wearing lab coats, aimed to get people more interested in science and uses scientific terms in the lyrics.\nThe Heavy Music Club, performing as Babymetal, was spun off from Sakura Gakuin as a separate musical group in 2013, following the graduation of its lead singer, Suzuka Nakamoto.\nAn italicized English name in the \"club\" column denotes that the group in question is defunct.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nSakura Gakuin 2010 Nendo: Message (2011)\nSakura Gakuin 2011 Nendo: Friends (2012)\nSakura Gakuin 2012 Nendo: My Generation (2013)\nSakura Gakuin 2013 Nendo: Kizuna (2014)\nSakura Gakuin 2014 Nendo: Kimi ni Todoke (2015)\nSakura Gakuin 2015 Nendo: Kirameki no Kakera (2016)\nSakura Gakuin 2016 Nendo: Yakusoku (2017)\nSakura Gakuin 2017 Nendo: My Road (2018)\nSakura Gakuin 2018 Nendo: Life Iro Asenai Hibi (2019)\nSakura Gakuin 2019 Nendo: Story (2020)\nSakura Gakuin 2020 Nendo: Thank You (2021)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website  (in Japanese)\nOfficial profile at Amuse Inc.

    "text": "BanYa (반야), sometimes spelled BANYA or Banya, was the South Korean arcade game company Andamiro's musical group responsible for creating original songs for Pump It Up. The style of its music varies greatly, from hip hop to electronic, from rock to classical crossovers.\nClassical remixes are among BanYa's most popular productions. Several sonatas, symphonies and other pieces feature in different versions. Mixing violins, guitars and heavy beats, these songs draw particular attention from players and passers-by. BanYa also composes original music including trance, techno, hardcore and ambient breaks.\nBeginning in Pump It Up NX, former BanYa member Yahpp became a solo artist and in turn his new music became credited to him. Starting in Pump It Up Fiesta, msgoon, another former member, did the same. All other former members, starting on NX, became credited as  \"BanYa Production\". For the consistency of the article, all songs by the original BanYa collective are listed here.\n\n\n== Song catalogue ==\nThe group's first two releases under the name of BanYa were Ignition Starts and Hypnosis, although Bee, Solitary and Final Audition had been already recorded by Yahpp as an independent artist. Up to 2004 they released 3 albums, however some nonstop remixes of several BanYa songs have also been made for Pump It Up.\nOn Pump It Up Exceed 2, Radezky Can Can was moved from the \"K-Pop Channel\" to the \"BanYa Channel\", even though it was made by F2 System, who worked with Andamiro to make Pump It Up Extra. Holiday, the other F2 song, has only showed up on Extra, The PREX and The PREX 2.\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: The 1st Dance Floor ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: The 2nd Dance Floor ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up The O.B.G: The 3rd Dance Floor ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up The O.B.G: The Season Evolution Dance Floor ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: The Perfect Collection ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: Extra ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: The Rebirth ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: The Premiere 3 ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: The PREX 3 ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: Exceed ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: Exceed 2 ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: Zero ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: NX ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: NX2 ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: NX Absolute ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: Fiesta ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: Fiesta EX ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: Prime ===\n\n\n=== Pump It Up: Infinity ===\n\n\n=== StepManiaX ===\n\n\n=== Additional songs ===\nBanYa also released some songs on promotional CDs, which are not featured so far in any games:\n\n\"Warm Shadow in a Stranger's Eyes\"\n\"Going Home\"\n\"Golden Tears\"\n\"Let Me Break it Down\"\nAs well as Full versions of the following in-game songs:\n\n\"Beat of the War 2\" (Full version is playable on NX, NX2, NXA and Fiesta)\n\"Canon-D\" (its Full version is a secret remix on Exceed 2, but has yet appear on any soundtracks.

It also included an electric guitar version of Ignition Starts instead of the original hardcore version, a version of Hate sung by Pp (the same girl who sang Pumping Up) and a completely new song, a ballad entitled \"Warm Shadow in a Stranger's Eyes\" (rough translation, as it's very hard to translate this title from Korean). All the songs that existed in a version longer than the one appearing in the arcade were included in their original versions, except Final Audition.\n\nNightmare\nMidnight Blue\nShe Likes Pizza (Pump mix)\nClose Your Eyes\nFree Style\nTurkey March\nPumping Up\nFirst Love\nAn Interesting View\nOh!

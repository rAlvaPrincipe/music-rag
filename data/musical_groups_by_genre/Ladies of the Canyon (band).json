Their sound encompasses a melding of influences, such as roots, rock, country, and Americana.  The group has released two albums.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 2005, Ladies of the Canyon began their career playing small venues in Montreal’s popular Mile-End neighbourhood. At the time their music consisted mainly of \"countrified\" 1970s Californian soft-rock sound; over time their musical style expanded to include classic folk and contemporary rock.\nThe group released their first studio album, Haunted Woman, in 2010 through Kindling/Warner Music Canada. In the three years following this release, Ladies of the Canyon appeared on stage with  Broken Social Scene and The Dears, were nominated for a Canadian Country Music Association award. The band worked with producer Mark Howard to record their second album, Diamond Heart.  In 2012, during the recording of this album, Sargeant was replaced by drummer Tara Martin.  Diamond Heart was released in September, 2013.\nIn 2014 the Ladies of the Canyon toured with the Barenaked Ladies.\n\n\n== Solo careers ==\nMaia Davies has launched a solo career by releasing her debut French language album, Héritage, using her mononym Maia (now known as Maia Lily, stylized as Maïa Lily).

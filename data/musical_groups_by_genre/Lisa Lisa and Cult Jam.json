    "text": "Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam were an urban contemporary band and one of the first freestyle music groups to emerge from New York City in the 1980s. Cult Jam consisted of vocalist Lisa Lisa, born Lisa Velez, guitarist/bassist Alex \"Spanador\" Moseley, and drummer/keyboardist Mike Hughes. They were assembled and initially produced by Full Force.\n\n\n== History ==\nLisa Lisa and Cult Jam was formed after Velez auditioned with Full Force, a production team from East Flatbush, Brooklyn, at the age of 14. In 1985, the group released their debut album Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam with Full Force. The group was signed by Columbia Records, which released their single \"I Wonder If I Take You Home\" to the European division of CBS Records in 1983, for the compilation album Breakdancing. \nStateside club DJs began playing the single from the imported LP in 1984, and the U.S. division of CBS, Columbia Records, released the record. It quickly became a chart-topper on Billboard's Hot Dance/Disco chart. It then crossed over to the R&B chart, where it peaked at No. 6, and then to the pop chart, peaking at No. 34 in the summer of 1985. The single eventually went gold.\n\"I Wonder If I Take You Home\" was followed by another club hit, \"Can You Feel the Beat\", which went to No. 40 on the R&B chart in late 1985. A sampling of the lyrics of this song WAS later used by Nina Sky for their 2004 hit single \"Move Ya Body\". Their third single, the ballad \"All Cried Out\", went gold, going to number No. 3 R&B and No. 8 pop in summer 1986. In 1997, \"All Cried Out\" was recorded by Allure, and was a hit in 1998. Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam with Full Force went platinum.\nTheir second album, Spanish Fly, was a success in 1987. It spawned two No. 1 pop hits, \"Head to Toe\" and \"Lost in Emotion\", both of which went gold. \"Head to Toe\" parked at No. 1 R&B for two weeks and stayed in the pop top 5 nearly three months. \"Lost in Emotion's\" video became the fourth most played of 1987 on MTV. Spanish Fly went platinum, peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart. Other singles from the album were the ballad \"Someone to Love Me for Me\", No. 7 R&B, and \"Everything Will B-Fine\", No. 9 R&B.\nIn between albums they recorded \"Go for Yours\", which was featured in the movie Caddyshack II.\nTheir third album was titled Straight to the Sky and was released in 1989. It featured the single \"Little Jackie Wants to Be a Star\".\nTheir fourth and final album, Straight Outta Hell's Kitchen, was less of a success, though it did include a hit with \"Let the Beat Hit 'Em\", which was a No. 1 hit on both the R&B and club charts. The group disbanded in 1991.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nHead to Toe (1995, Sony Music)\nLisa Lisa and Friends (1995, Sony Music)\nPast, Present & Future (1996, Thump)\nSuper Hits (1997, Sony Music)\nPlaylist: The Very Best of Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam with Full Force (2010, Columbia/Legacy)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one hits (United States)\nList of artists who reached number one on the Hot 100 (U.S.)\nList of number-one dance hits (United States)\nList of artists who reached number one on the U.S. Dance chart\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLisa Lisa at AllMusic\nLisa Lisa and Cult Jam at IMDb"

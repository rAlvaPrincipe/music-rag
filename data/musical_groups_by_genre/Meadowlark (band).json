McGill, who had until that point been known for her covers of popular songs, which she posted on her YouTube channel, announced the formation of the band on 22 March 2013. On the same day, they released a live version of a track titled \"Family Tree\", which focuses on Kate's home life. Meadowlark released their first EP, Three Six Five, on 26 May 2014. In September of that year, it was announced on social media that Carl Jones would no longer be part of the band, signifying a fresh start. Kate and Daniel released their first EP as a duo, named Dual, on 30 March 2015. Their single \"Eyes Wide\" gained popularity through the radio show BBC Music Introducing, and they performed at Glastonbury Festival on the BBC Introducing stage later that year. In 2016, Meadowlark released the Paraffin EP, followed by two singles, \"Quicksand\" and \"Headlights\".\nMeadowlark's debut album, Postcards, came out on 30 June 2017.\nOn 26 November 2021, the duo released their sophomore album, titled Nightstorm.\nOn 3 February 2023, Meadowlark released the single \"Full Me, Half You\".

On 13 April 2023, it was announced that Meadowlark would be supporting English singer-songwriter Sivu on his headline show at the Courtyard Theatre, London in June 2023; the show would be Meadowlark's first live performance in five years. However, on 12 June 2023, McGill tested positive for COVID-19, so the band was replaced by Badhead Hyland and Bea Stewart as support acts.

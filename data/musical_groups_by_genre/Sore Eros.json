    "text": "Sore Eros is an American indie band started by Robert Robinson around the early 2000s in Connecticut.  Branded as lo-fi, pop music with psychedelic elements. In 2007 Robinson began collaborating with a long lost friend, Adam Langellotti which soon became their first official release, Second Chants. Sore Eros is now an equally collective effort incorporating Jeff Morkeski on lead guitar and Matt Jugenheimer on drums.\nSore Eros has been working on a new full-length album with Adam Granduciel of The War on Drugs producing. This project has been in the works for several years.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSecond Chants (2009) Shdwply Records\nKnow Touching (2010) Shdwply Records\nTaal Compass/Wide Open (2010) Blackburn Recordings\nJust Fuzz (2011) Blackburn Recordings\nSickies Volume 1 (2011) Night People\nSickies Volume 2 (2012) Feeding Tube Records\n9\" Lathe Cut Split w/ Kurt Vile (2012) Feeding Tube Records\nKurt Vile/Sore Eros - Jamaica Plain 10\" (2013) Care In The Community Records\nSay People (2015) LP/VHS Feeding Tube Records\nSore Eros /self titled (2020) Double LP Feeding Tube Records\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBandcamp Page \nDiscography \nPitchfork Review by Jayson Greene \nTiny Mix Tapes, Second Chants Review by parallelliott\nAll Music Guide review by Ned Raggett \nDusted, Second Chants Review By Michael Cramer \nDrowned In Sound, Second Chants Review by Paul Brown Archived 2009-09-28 at the Wayback Machine\nAltsounds Second Chants Review by Eli Tor\n\nPitchfork News by Matthew Strauss"

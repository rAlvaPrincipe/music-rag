    "text": "Kyau & Albert is the working name for two trance music producers and DJs from Germany named Ralph Kyau (German: [ˈkaɪu]) and Steven Moebius Albert. They were formerly known as Kyau vs. Albert but changed their working name to Kyau & Albert in 2006.\n\n\n== History ==\nRalph Kyau had his first experience with the production of electronic music in 1990 and gained a reputation for DJing as well as Live PA sets at several underground techno parties in Germany before releasing his first record \"Modulation Experiments\" at the end of 1993.\nTogether with DJ Shandy he founded the label Harmony Recordings in 1993 and they signed the massive Mirco de Govia as their first act. At the same time, Steven Moebius Albert began to produce his own tracks and in the summer of 1994, Ralph and Steven met for the first time.\nThey produced their first tracks together for a live performance, realized that they have a common perception of music, and decided to try their hands at producing together. The result was their first single \"Let me in\" released in 1996. From then on they became known under the artist name of Kyau vs Albert. Their two small studios merged and they founded the music production company \"Euphonic\" in 1997, signing Sonorous aka Rough Mullar as well as Ronski Speed. With such a strong backing of producers, the team began pushing for their sound to be heard.\nIn 2000, the guise of Kyau vs Albert became recognized by WEA (part of Warner Music) and a long term contract was put together, forming the start of their journey into dance music, with huge support from DJs such as Paul van Dyk, KayCee, Tiësto and many others.\nIn 2002, Sun Decade (one of Ronski Speed aliases) shined on the Euphonic label with the massive \"I'm Alone\". The track blew the roof off many house and clubs around the world with its soaring vocals and superb productions, putting Kyau & Albert and their Euphonic label at the top of the list in the industry.\nTo celebrate 15 years in the industry Kyau & Albert released the album '15 Years' In March 2012, an album of their best tracks remixed by a carefully selected group of contemporary trance artists as well as some of their brand new material.\nThe duo featured in the annual DJ Magazine Top 100 DJs poll for four consecutive years (2007-2010).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n2004 Here We Are Now \n2006 Worldvibe\n2013 Nights Awake\n2015 Distant Lights\n2016 20 Years\n2017 Matching Stories\n2018 Neverlost\n2019 Euphonic 300\n2024 All In Good Time\n\n\n=== DJ mixes ===\n2003 Kyau vs. Albert – Review\n2004 Positive Ways 4\n2004 Techno club Next 2\n2005 This Is Trance 3\n2006 From Euphonic To Russia\n2007 Euphonic 10 Years\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n2008  Euphonic 10 Years\n2009  Best Of 2002-2009\n2012 15 Years - The Album\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n2018 Neverlost, Part 1\n2018 Neverlost, Part 2\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1993 Kyau - Modulation Experiments [Xplode Records]\n1994 Kyau - Overflyer [Harmony Records]\n1994 Kyau - House Will [Harmony Records]\n1996 Kyau vs. Albert - Let Me In [Harmony Records]\n1997 Kyau vs. Albert - Rocket [Happy Vibes Records]\n1998 Kyau vs. Albert - Let Me In (The Mixes) [Euphonic]\n1998 Kyau vs. Albert - Lovemassacre [Euphonic]\n1999 Moebius AG - Do What I Want [Rouge Pulp]\n2000 Kyau vs. Albert - Great / Loebau [Euphonic]\n2000 Kyau vs. Albert - LFO [Euphonic]\n2000 Kyau vs. Albert - Euphonic [Euphonic]\n2001 Kyau vs. Albert - Outside [WEA]\n2001 Moebius AG - Come on Girl [ZYX Germany]\n2002 Kyau vs. Albert - Save Me [WEA]\n2003 Kyau vs. Albert - Velvet Morning [Euphonic]\n2004 Kyau vs. Albert - Made Of Sun [Euphonic]\n2004 Kyau vs. Albert Feat Julie - Not with You [Euphonic]\n2006 Kyau vs. Albert - Kiksu [Euphonic]\n2006 Kyau vs. Albert - Walk Down [Euphonic]\n2006 Kyau vs. Albert - Are You Fine?

    "text": "The Royal Dunedin Male Choir is one of New Zealand's oldest male choirs. Their repertoire includes popular tunes, hymns, operatic choruses, folk songs and traditional melodies. The Choir undertakes fee-paying and charity engagements throughout the Otago, Southland and South Canterbury regions of New Zealand. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe Choir's origins can be traced back to 1878 and the entertainment provided at functions marking the opening of the northern railway link into Dunedin. From this evolved a Liedertaefel Quartet which, in response to public demand, was to become the Dunedin Liedertaefel Society which was incorporated on 1 May 1886. Its aims were stated as \"the practice and performance of music for male voices, and for the cultivation of a refined taste in that class of music\". Its founder was Mr. S. Moyle.\nIn 1915 the name was changed to the Dunedin Male Choir, with the word \"Royal\" being added by royal patent in 1927, acknowledging three performances before royalty in 1901, 1920, and 1927.\nThe Royal Dunedin Male Choir from time to time combined with the Dunedin Choral Society (City of Dunedin Choir) in performances.\nAudiences have included these notable persons:\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary)\nThe Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII)\nThe Duke of York (later King George VI)\nDuke of Gloucester\nQueen Elizabeth II\nThe Duke of Edinburgh\nPrince Charles (later the Prince of Wales)\nPrincess Anne (later The Princess Royal)\nDuke and Duchess of Kent\nVarious Governors-General of New Zealand\nLord Jellicoe\nLord Cobham\nSir Paul Reeves\nLord Provost of Edinburgh\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe Royal Dunedin Male Choir is administered by the Royal Dunedin Male Choir Incorporated, limited to and exclusively for charitable purposes, in New Zealand.

During Kivel's elementary years, he, along with his twin brother Matt and a close friend, began creating music ultimately forming the band Princeton in 2005. The following year, Kivel began dating Edmundson who is currently known for her contributions to Foam Magazine along with Bon Appétit, C magazine, EvilMonito.com and Variety.com. Eventually, although not specified, Kivel and Edmundson began composing music together and, as a result, formed the band Kisses in 2010.\nKivel's friendship with producer Alec R. Costandinos allowed for the production and release of Kisses's debut single “Bermuda” via Transparent Records in April 2010, and People Can Do the Most Amazing Things that August on IAMSOUND.” Additionally, Kisses had released other EPs including Other Planets as a download and Midnight Lover as a promo single on the label This is Music.

    "text": "Khanate is an American drone doom supergroup that brought together James Plotkin and Alan Dubin, two members of the defunct band OLD, as well as Tim Wyskida of Blind Idiot God and Manbyrd and Stephen O'Malley of Burning Witch and Sunn O))).\nKeeping some similarity with O'Malley's previous band Burning Witch, Khanate produces songs that usually exceeded the 10-minute mark, characterized by extremely slow  tempos, harsh layers of feedback, and vocalist Alan Dubin's torturous shrieking.\nOn September 24, 2006, Khanate split up, with Plotkin stating that the \"lack of commitment from certain members\" led to the split.\nIn the January/February 2009 issue of Rock-A-Rolla magazine, vocalist Alan Dubin stated: \"We had a few festival offers [that] sparked some talk of a reunion but they didn't pan out in the end.\" He went on to say, \"I highly doubt a reunion will happen.\"\nOn May 19, 2023, the band released a surprise album titled To Be Cruel digitally and announced preorders for a physical release to be released in June. The band also announced digital reissues of its four previous albums and plans for physical reissues to follow.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAlan Dubin – vocals (2000–2006, 2009–2010, 2017–present)\nStephen O'Malley – guitars (2000–2006, 2009–2010, 2017–present)\nJames Plotkin – bass (2000–2006, 2009–2010, 2017–present)\nTim Wyskida – drums (?–2006, 2009–2010, 2017–present)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nKhanate (2001)\nThings Viral (2003)\nCapture & Release (2005)\nClean Hands Go Foul (2009)\nTo Be Cruel (2023)\n\n\n=== Other releases ===\nLive WFMU 91.1 (2002, Live)\nNo Joy (Remix) (2003, EP)\nLet Loose The Lambs (2004, Live DVD; limited to 230 copies)\nKHNT vs. Stockholm (2004, Live)\nLive Aktion Sampler 2004 (2004, Live)\nDead/Live Aktions (2005, DVD)\nIt's Cold When Birds Fall From The Sky (2005, Live; limited to 500 copies)\n\n\n== See also ==\nSunn O)))\nGnaw\nBurning Witch\nBlind Idiot God\nKhlyst\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSouthern Lord Label Info\nLoad Records Label Info\nKhanate at James Plotkin's website\nKhanate discography at MusicBrainz\nKhanate at Encyclopaedia Metallum\nStephen O'Malley's official website\nKhanate at Last.fm\nTim Wyskida's official website https://www.timwyskida.com/"

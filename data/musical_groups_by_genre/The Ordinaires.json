    "text": "The Ordinaires was a nine piece experimental rock band from New York City. The band, which broke up in 1991, was composed of Angela Babin (guitar), Robin Casey (violin), Joe Dizney (guitar), Sven Furberg (bass), Kurt Hoffman (tenor saxophone), Barbara Schloss (violin), Jim Thomas (drums), Fritz Van Orden (alto saxophone), Garo Yellin (cello), and Peter Moffitt (cello, from 1984-1987).\nBorn as the early '80's New York no wave/noise movement began to take root, the band was both an outgrowth of and a reaction against the shapeless dissonance of their peers. Initially named Off-Beach, the band christened themselves The Ordinaires after completing two tracks for a Lower East Side compilation record. The name was a simplification of The Vin Ordinaires (based on the French term for table wine), and a pun on the name of band member Fritz Van Orden.\nTheir self-titled debut, recorded at New York's CBGB's, was released on the German Dossier label and was then released in America by Bar/None Records.\nThe Ordinaires are credited on the song \"Kiss Me, Son Of God\" by They Might Be Giants, and Kurt Hoffman would later be a part of They Might Be Giants' backing band.\nAdam Duritz of the band Counting Crows is wearing a The Ordinaries shirt in the music video of their hit song Mr. Jones.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Ordinaires - LP (1986, Dossier Records)\nOne - LP/Cassette (1989, Bar/None Records)\n\n\n=== Compilation Appearances ===\nPeripheral Vision - \"Bands of Loisaida\" - Cassette (1982, Zoar Records)\nIsland of Sanity - \"New Music From New York\" - LP (1987, Rec-Rec Records)\nTime For A Change (1989, Bar/None Records)1989 - Time For A Change (Bar/None Records compilation)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Ordinaires: They Might Be Giants Knowledge Base\nBar/None Records overview"

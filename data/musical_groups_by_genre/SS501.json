    "text": "SS501 is a South Korean boy band consisting of five members: Kim Hyun-joong, Heo Young-saeng, Kim Kyu-jong, Park Jung-min and Kim Hyung-jun. They debuted in 2005 with the EP Warning, which included their first number one song, \"Never Again\".\nIn 2007, SS501 entered the Japanese market with the maxi single Kokoro, which debuted at number five on the Oricon chart. The following year, in 2008, they became the first South Korean artists to win the award for Best New Artist at the Japan Gold Disc Awards.\nSS501 has released one studio album and seven EPs in Korean, and two studio albums and three EPs in Japanese. After 14 years of inactivity, the group is set to reunite in 2025 for their 20th anniversary.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the band is a combination of letters and numbers that have special meaning. The first “S” stands for \"superstar\", the second “S” is an abbreviation for \"singer\", and the combination of 5, 0, and 1 symbolizes \"five members united as one forever\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut ===\nBefore debuting with SS501, most of the members had some experience in the entertainment world. \nKim Hyun-joong was initially about to debut in a five-member group which included Han Yeon of B2Y (now disbanded) who was to be the leader and Kim would be the youngest member. During 2001 and 2002, while working as a waiter in a family restaurant located at Jamsil-dong, Kim was introduced to a new set up management company CEO. While the group underwent training together, they were asked by their company to debut in China as a Hallyu project group but they rejected the offer and disbanded.\nHeo Young-saeng started as a trainee at SM Entertainment for about 2.5 years. He then joined DSP Media (formerly known as DSP Entertainment) and trained for three months before debuting as a member of SS501. According to his father, if he had stayed with SM Entertainment as a trainee, he would probably have debuted with Super Junior.\nPark Jung-min was once a commercial model for condoms. When he was 13, he was scouted by an agency and was accepted by both DSP Media and S.M. Entertainment. At that time, SM Entertainment told him that they were preparing a new group but the group consisted of many members. According to Park, this was probably Super Junior since he saw them rehearsing too.\nKim Hyung-jun appeared on Ock Joo-hyun's music video, \"Catch\" in 2004. He was also the first one to be included in SS501 which means he had the longest training period.\nIn addition, SS501 has had their first variety show before they officially debuted entitled SS501 M!Pick by MNET.  It documented their pre-debut days and the three months after their debut.\n\n\n=== 2005–06: Debut ===\nSS501 debuted on June 8, 2005 along with their first EP, Kyeonggo (Korean: \"경고\", \"Warning\");. Their second mini album, Snow Prince was released in late 2005, five months after their debut. The group earned popularity right away as they won many rookie awards after their debut.\nThe group was inactive in Korea for most of 2006, although they had their first fan meeting in Japan in April of that year. The reason was due to Heo Young Saeng's throat condition, which required a surgery, thus resulting in a need for time to fully recover. In mid-2006, they held their first successful concert, \"Step Up Concert\" in Osaka, Japan. In late 2006, they returned to Korea in order to promote their first studio album, which was released on November 10 entitled S.T 01 Now. Singles from the album included \"Unlock\" and \"Four Chance\". Alongside promoting the album on various variety and music shows, they also filmed a show on MNet, which was called SS501 SOS. The group (excepting Heo Young Saeng, who was recovering from the surgery) also lent their voices for the 2006 animated movie Pi's Story.\n\n\n=== 2007–08: Breakthrough success, Japanese debut, Boys Over Flowers, and sub-unit ===\n\nLater in 2007, the group debuted in the Japanese market to further spread their activities and challenge themselves outside Korea. The group at this time released their Japanese single Kokoro, alongside multiple versions, including one with all members and five featuring each member individually. The single debuted at the 5th spot on the Oricon chart, and moved to 3rd spot the next day. It was also chosen as an ending theme song for an anime entitled Blue Dragon.\nSS501 appeared in the Japanese drama Hotelier as a cameo seen in episode seven. Later in September, SS501 released their second single in Japan entitled Distance. Finally in October 24, a month later, a full album was released with their self-titled album, SS501. SS501 also received the \"Newcomer Award\" by Japan Gold Disc Award in January 2008; this was the first time for Korean artists to receive this award.\nSS501 returned to Korea with their single Deja Vu, which was released on March 13, 2008. The title track was the first song to be promoted, and they began their comeback on music channel M.Net's M Countdown. After their success with their single \"Deja Vu\", they began to promote their second single, \"A Song Calling for You\". They performed their Goodbye Stage on Music Bank in June 2008, to return to Japanese activities. Their third Japanese single was released on June 18, 2008 entitled Lucky Days. Then, for a short period of time, they return in Korea and released a mini album entitled, Find.\nOn October 4, the group represented Korea to perform at the Seoul World Cup Stadium, and received the Best Asian Artist Award at the 5th Asia Song Festival, organised by Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange.\nOn October 2, 2008, Kim Hyun-joong was cast for his first lead-acting role as 'Yoon Ji-hoo' in the Korean version of Hana Yori Dango, named Boys Over Flowers, a role for which he won the \"Most Popular Actor Award\" at the Seoul International Drama Awards 2009 and the \"Popularity Award\" at the 45th Baeksang Arts Awards. The series was broadcast on KBS during the first half of 2009. During this time, around early 2009, Park Jung-min was also cast for his musical debut in Grease as \"Danny Park\", where he received the award \"Best New Musical Talent\" by the Golden Ticket Awards. While both Kim and Park were busy with their schedules, the remaining three members formed 'SS501 Project Group' with Heo Young-saeng as the leader. The 'Project Group' was initially to be named after their fan club 'Triple S', however before the sub-unit group debut it was decided to retain 'SS501' name out of respect to the absent members. They released a project album named U R Man in November 2008, with a high tempo dance track \"U R Man\", which the three remaining SS501 members promoted by themselves, with the exception of some special performances that included all five band members. The project group also performed \"U R Man\" in episode four of Boys Over Flowers, where they appeared for a cameo performance. Moreover, they contributed to the Boys Over Flowers soundtrack with \"내 머리가 나빠서\" (Because I'm Stupid) track, in which they received multiple awards such as \"Song of the Month (February)\", \"Best OST Award\", and \"Best TV Drama Song of the Year\" just to name a few.\n\n\n=== 2009–10: EPs, first Asian tour, leaving DSP Media ===\n\nSS501 released their official second Japanese studio album, All My Love, on May 13, 2009. Although they were doing a cappella performances during their past years, it was their first time to record and include an a cappella title track to their album, \"All My Love\". A promotional tour was held in Japan in support of the album.\nOn July 21, 2009, they released their sixth EP, Solo Collection, which consisted of the individual members' songs. It also includes a mini-drama starring SS501, particularly Kim Hyun-joong and Park Jung-min. In August 2009, they embarked on their 1st Asia Tour Persona, with two concerts in Seoul. It was followed by fifteen concerts in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, China, Malaysia, and Singapore.\nThe group's seventh EP Rebirth was released in two parts: in a limited and a full edition. The former was released on October 20, and the latter on October 22. SS501 promoted the album with the single \"Love Like This\", a track collaborated by Steven Lee, Sean Alexander, and Drew Ryan Scott. The single was also sung by Varsity Fanclub, Scott's group, in English lyrics with the same title single, which was released later in 2010.\nIn 2010, SS501 continued their 1st Asia Tour Persona concert in Thailand before holding their final encore concert, on February 27, in Seoul to conclude the tour. Although the release of a new EP was planned for May 1, 2010 (a nod towards \"501\" in the group's name, or as they call it \"501\" day), the date was pushed back in order to \"add finishing touches\". They performed at the 2010 Dream Concert later that month. Because Kim Hyun-joong was still recovering from a previous injury, they sang two ballads instead of the rumored comeback track.\nTheir last EP before the contract's expiration, entitled Destination, was released on May 24, 2010. The lead track, \"Love Ya\", composed by Steven Lee, is a song accompanied by an orchestra, and blended with a piano melody. Their first win for the lead track, \"Love Ya\", was on KBS' Music Bank, on June 11. On June 18, DSP announced that SS501 would end their \"Love Ya\" promotions due to the expiration of their contract on June 7, 2010, five years after their debut.\nDuring the second half of 2010, upon the expiration of the group's contract with DSP Media, all the members signed with other management companies. Kim Hyun-joong signed with KeyEast, Park Jung-min joined CNR Media, Kim Hyung-jun with S-Plus Entertainment. Heo Young-saeng and Kim Kyu-jong both signed with B2M Entertainment.\nKim Hyun-joong explained in an interview that, at the time, there wasn't a company that would accept them as a whole, thus the group decided to take the chance to focus on their solo activities. In October 2010, Kim Hyung-jun announced that SS501 was planning release a new album in 2011 but was pushed back, probably because of their busy schedules.\n\n\n=== 2011–2015: Hiatus and SS501 Best Collection ===\nWith the group on hiatus, the members pursued solo activities.\nKim Hyun-joong joined KeyEast after leaving DSP Entertainment and started promoting both as an actor and singer. His first acting project was Korean drama Playful Kiss, that was broadcast on MBC in September 2010. He played the leading role of \"Baek Seung Jo\" in the drama. He then released his debut solo album Break Down on June 8, 2011 and it exceeded 70,000 pre-ordered copies in ten days. The album was certified gold in Korea and was certified platinum in Taiwan. The album also debuted at #1 in oricon weekly foreign album charts. In May 2015, Kim Hyun-joong officially enlisted for his mandatory military service.\nHeo Young-saeng and Kim Kyu-jong held a joint fanmeeting, Kim Kyu-jong & Heo Young-saeng Story In Seoul on December 4, which continued in Hong Kong, Japan and countries across Asia. Heo Young-saeng was scheduled to launch his solo singing career on April 28, 2011, but had to postpone because he pulled the ligaments on his right hand during dance practice. His debut solo mini album, Let It Go was released on May 12, 2011, which features Kim Kyu-jong and Hyuna of girl group 4minute. The album peaked at number one on Gaon's album chart for the week starting on May 8, 2011. In November and December, Heo made his theatrical musical debut in The Three Musketeers.

After serving his mandatory military service as a police officer, he was discharged on July 30, 2015.\nKim Kyu-jong made his musical debut in Goong: Musical, playing the lead role of Crown Prince Lee Shin, in Kyoto, Japan from June 11 to July 1, and debuted as a solo artist in September 2011 with mini album Turn Me On. The album features rap by Heo Young-saeng in dance track \"My Love\", and Yang Jiwon of Spica in Yesterday music video. On July 23, Kim reported to the recruit training center of the 35th division in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province for four weeks of basic training. They further explained that he was originally exempted because he has a hepatitis B carrier. However, since there was a change in the conscription law, he was eligible to serve non-active duty as a public service worker. On July 18, Kim released a limited edition, and later on a normal edition, mini-album Meet Me Again dedicated to his fans before his enlistment.\nPark Jung-min's comeback single, Not Alone, was originally planned to be released on November 25, 2010, but was pushed back to January 20, 2011.

Kim Hyun Joong was not able to be in the video at that time because he had a shooting on his variety show, Barefoot Friends. However, Kim Hyun Joong still talked about his debut on his Korea fanmeeting entitled 2013 KHJ Show - Party People, held at the same day of their anniversary.\nOn October 26, 2013, Heo had his first and farewell concert in Seoul entitled \"2013 Heo Young Saeng Seoul Concert 0513 My Story\", which marked the first time that all five members of SS501 appeared together on one stage and performed together as a group again after three years, as seen at the UNIQLO AX Hall.\nIn 2014, SS501 released \"SS501 Best Collection\" album in Japan on September.

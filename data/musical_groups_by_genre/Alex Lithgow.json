    "text": "Alexander Frame Lithgow (1 December 1870 in Glasgow – 12 July 1929 in Launceston, Tasmania) was a Scottish-born, New Zealand and Australian based composer and bandleader known as the \"Sousa of the Antipodes\".\nHis name is pronounced \"Alek\" by his family.\n\n\n== Youth ==\nIn 1876, the Lithgows emigrated to Invercargill, New Zealand.  Aged 6, Alex went to Invercargill Grammar School (now Invercargill Middle School). He attended Invercargill's Presbyterian Church, First Church. He liked Ice Hockey, the Circus and Rugby. His family was musical, performing as the six-member Lithgow Concert Company around Southland.\n1881 At the age of 11 having had lessons on the cornet initially by his father, Alex joined the local brass band the Invercargill Garrison Band. Alex also learnt the violin to a very high standard.\n1886 At the age of 16 he advanced to be the band's solo and principal cornetist. However, despite often being stated, he never was this Band's conductor.\n1887 At the age of 17 his first composition, 'Wairoa', was published. This was named after a ship at the band was playing on at the Invercargill estuary.\n\n\n== Early adulthood ==\nAlex played for the Star Rugby football club in Invercargill.\nAlex played with the Theatre Royal orchestra as first violin. \nHe won national solo cornet titles for the next few years.\n1893 At the age of 23 he toured New Zealand as a professional soloist.\n\n\n== Move to Australia ==\n1894 Aged 24 he left New Zealand and moved to Australia where became conductor of the St Joseph's Total Abstinence Society Band in Launceston Tasmania. He earned his living as a compositor at The Examiner and the Daily Telegraph.\n1900 Alex aged 30 married Elizabeth Hill Telfer at a Presbyterian church at Launceston on 6 June.\n1901 He came back briefly to New Zealand to conduct the Woolston Band at Christchurch where at a charity concert the band performed an entire concert of his compositions.\n1903 He went back to Launceston St Joseph's Band.\n1904 At the age 34 he started the Australian Army's 12th Battalion Launceston Regiment Band.\n1909 He spent his time conducting and being a spontaneous composer for the silent film orchestra at the Lyceum and Princess Theatres.\n\n\n== Later life ==\n1922 He returned to the St Joseph's band for the last time.\n1923 He founded and conducted the Launceston Concert Orchestra where he presented many of his compositions plus symphonic jazz. There were more charity all-Lithgow compositions concerts.\n1927 at the age of 57 he retired from work and the Band due to ill health.\nHis marches were published throughout the world and the Americans acclaimed him as 'the Sousa of the Antipodes'.  Lithgow produced approximately two hundred marches, as well as numerous pieces for band, orchestra, piano and voice.  He acquired no copyrights and many of his pieces, in his immaculate notation, were lost or unpublished. Music dominated his existence, but time for composing was scarce when after a long day's work he cycled home to change for an evening performance or a musical gathering.\nHe died on June 12, 1929, at the age of 59 a few months short of his 60th birthday Lithgow died of a Stroke at Launceston. At his funeral massed bands played The 'Invercargill'.  He is buried in Carr Villa cemetery. He was survived by his wife, son and two daughters. One of the granddaughters Pat Ward wrote a book on him. In 1953 a memorial plaque was unveiled at Paterson Street Barracks and a Band Rotunda built in City Park, Launceston. Still today in Tasmania they continue with Lithgow-only concerts. Tasmanians regard him as theirs but to Kiwis he is from Invercargill.\nLithgow wrote the 'Galvini March' in tribute to his patron B. Galvin, an Australian construction and manufacturing magnate who was a pallbearer at his funeral.\n\nA statue was made of him in 2019 and sits in the heart of Invercargill next to the theater.\n\n\n== Works ==\nApollo House\nArtillery\nAustralia\nCanberra\nLithgow\nMiddlington\nNational Guard, The\nNew South Wales\nNew Zealand\nQueen of the North\nRauparaha\nRoyal Australian Navy\nRyanda\nSons of Australia\nSouthlanders, The\nStars and Cross\nSunshine\nAustralian Girls – A march\nGallipoli – March – See [ANZAC] day, a national holiday\nHathaway – for Brass Band\nHonour the Brave – Slow March\nThe Courier – for Brass Band\nThe Vikings – for Brass Band\nThe skipper – for Brass Band\nBrigade of the Guards – For Brass Band\nAustralian Wedding March\nAustralia March (tape stored at National Film and Sound Archive, Australia)\nThe Aboriginal Concert March\nNew South Wales March\nSouthstralia\nWestralia March\nWestbury March\nGippsland\nWallabies March (National Film & Sound Archive, Australia)\nThe boomerang\nSons of Australia\nSons of New Zealand\nKia Ora March\nRauparaha March\nNew Zealand March\nCity of Ballarat (National Film & Sound Archive, Australia)\nFighting Mac.\nRyanda.\nStars and cross.\nTasma.\nSons of Australia.\nVictoria March.\nMiddlington.\nCanberra.\nArtillery.\nEvandale\nCuckoos.\n1887 Wairoa, for brass band\n1894 The Cataract, for brass band – named for Cataract Gorge, Launceston\n1900 Australis, for cornet\n1901 Invercargill March, for brass band, also arranged for piano\n1901 Le Cirque – Fantasia\n1911 Gippsland, for brass band\n1916 March of the [ANZAC] (Australian & New Zealand Armed Corps)\n1917 Land of Moa, for brass band\n1917 Sons of Australia march\n1917 The Wallabies – named after a recruitment march by volunteers through queensland and new south wales, re-formed as a military unit.

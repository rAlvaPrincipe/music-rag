    "text": "Jonathan Carney is an American violinist and conductor.  \n\n\n== Career ==\nCarney grew up in Tenafly, New Jersey and graduated from Tenafly High School. He studied at the Juilliard School with Christine Dethier and Ivan Galamian. \nHe moved to London on a Leverhulme Fellowship Award to study at the Royal College of Music with Trevor Williams.\nIn 1991 he became leader of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and appeared as soloist with them in the UK and beyond. In 1994 he was appointed Concertmaster of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, having been joint leader on its American tour; he recorded the Nielsen concerto with them in 1997 (on a Domenico Montagnana instrument). As a member of the Michael Nyman Band he played on the soundtrack of several Peter Greenaway films.\nCarney is the concertmaster of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. In 2018, Katherine Needleman, principal oboist of the Baltimore Symphony, filed a sexual harassment complaint against the orchestra with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), accusing Carney of harassment and retaliation. The orchestra hired an independent investigator, and the investigation concluded there was no hostile work environment so Carney was not disciplined.  Carney was later suspended after additional allegations of “inappropriate behavior” toward a musician with the Mid-Atlantic Symphony were reported.\nNeedleman closed out her EEOC complaint in 2023, saying it had been several years since she heard anything from the agency, and filed a Freedom of Information Act to obtain all the documentation from her filing. Carney remains with the orchestra.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJonathan Carney at IMDb"

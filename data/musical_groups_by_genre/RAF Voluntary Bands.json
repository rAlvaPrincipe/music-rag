    "text": "RAF Voluntary Bands are voluntary military, brass or pipe bands that provide music for ceremonial and social occasions within the Royal Air Force, as well as local and national charities. In contrast to the RAF's professional musical bands (the RAF Central Band, the RAF Regiment Band and the RAF College Band), the bands are formed of volunteer musicians from RAF stations, other services and members of the local community.\n\n\n== RAF Voluntary Bands Association ==\nNumerous bands were founded at the formation of the RAF on 1 April 1918. Several can trace their roots to Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Flying Corps volunteer musicians. The bands are centrally administered through the RAF Voluntary Band Association which, co-ordinates policy and activities and represents its members on those occasions when they are called upon to participate in major public events. Each of the current nine voluntary bands in the RAF are located on a geographical basis at stations throughout the United Kingdom and Cyprus:\n\nRAF Akrotiri (Cyprus)\nRAF Brize Norton (Oxfordshire)\nRAF Cosford (Midlands)\nRAF Halton (London)\nRAF Honington (East Anglia)\nRAF Lossiemouth (Scotland)\nRAF St Athan (Wales)\nRAF Waddington Voluntary Band (Central England)\nRAF Wyton Area Voluntary Band (Eastern England)\nTo celebrate the 90th Anniversary of the RAF in 2008, a massed band event featuring members from all bands was held at Symphony Hall, Birmingham.\n\n\n== RAF Pipe Bands Association ==\nThere are five voluntary RAF pipe bands spread across the UK: three in Scotland and two in England.

Hovland then dropped out to work in the movie business, and Hance, guitarist/singer Pat McIntyre and drummer Randy Payne continued the band with guest bassists such as Rick Ness, formerly of Fig Dish (a key Cells member during his stint), Skid Marks, of Box-O-Car, Josh James and Bob Rising .  They released their debut album, \"We Can Replace You\" under Orange Recordings.\nAfter touring behind We Can Replace You as a 3-piece, Hance, McIntyre and Payne parted ways. Payne and McIntyre formed the band Cisco Pike.\nHance recruited drummer Mark Doyle (formerly of Loud Lucy, Verbow and Woolworthy) and bassist Johnny Furman (formerly of The Webb Brothers, The Lupins and The Darlings) in late 2003.

    "text": "Azra was a Yugoslav rock band that was one of the most popular acts of the Yugoslav new wave music of the 1980s. Azra was formed in 1977 by its frontman Branimir \"Johnny\" Štulić. The other two members of the original line-up were Mišo Hrnjak (bass) and Boris Leiner (drums). The band is named after a verse  from \"Der Asra\" by Heinrich Heine. They are considered to be one of the most influential bands from the Yugoslav new wave rock era and the Yugoslav rock scene in general.\nThey released their first single in 1979 with \"Balkan\" and \"A šta da radim\". Their eponymous debut was released in 1980 and achieved commercial success, giving them commercial success in Yugoslavia. Their second album was released in 1981. Azra recorded its last studio album Između krajnosti (Between the Extremes) in 1987. In 1988 the band recorded 4LP live album under the name Zadovoljština (Satisfaction), after which Štulić broke the band up. Štulić recorded three more solo albums since moving to the Netherlands, where he lives in seclusion. A 2003 rock documentary, Sretno dijete depicts Azra as the focus of the rock scene in Yugoslavia during the 1980s, along with Bijelo dugme. Even today, Azra remains very popular among youth in the countries of the former Yugoslavia.\nIn 1998, music critics compiled a list of 100 best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music. Five Azra albums were included, three of them in top 10. On the Radio B92's list of 100 greatest songs of former Yugoslavia, four Azra songs were included, all of them in the top 20.\n\n\n== Members ==\nBranimir \"Johnny\" Štulić – vocals, guitar\nBranko Matun – bass (1977)\nPaolo Sfeci – drums (1977)\nMladen Jurčić – guitar (1977–1978)\nBranko Hromatko – drums (1977–1978)\nMarino Pelajić – bass (1977–1978)\nJura Stublić – vocals (1978)\nBoris Leiner (ex Kanibali) – drums, vocals (from 1979)\nMišo Hrnjak – bass (1979–1982)\nJurica Pađen – guitars (1983–1984, from 1987)\nStephen Kipp – bass (from 1986)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nAzra (Jugoton, 1980)\nSunčana strana ulice (Jugoton, 1981)\nFiligranski pločnici (Jugoton, 1982)\nKad fazani lete (Jugoton, 1983)\nKrivo srastanje (Jugoton, 1984)\nIt Ain't Like In The Movies At All (Diskoton, 1986)\nIzmeđu krajnosti (Jugoton, 1987)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nRavno do dna (Jugoton, 1982)\nZadovoljština (Jugoton, 1988)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nSingl ploče 1979-1982  (Jugoton, 1982)\nKao i jučer – singl ploče 1983-1986  (Jugoton, 1986)\nNikom nije lepše (Hi-Fi Centar, 1998)\nThe Ultimate Collection (Croatia Records, 2007)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Balkan\" (The Balkans) / \"A šta da radim\" (And What Should I Do?) – (suzy 1979)\n\"Lijepe žene prolaze kroz grad\" (Pretty Women Passing Through Town), \"Poziv na ples\" (An Invitation to Dance) / \"Suzy F\". – (Jugoton, 1980)\n\"Đoni, budi dobar\" (Johnny Be Good) / \"Teško vrijeme\" (Hard Time) – (Jugoton 1982)\n\"E, pa što\" (So What) / \"Sloboda\" (Freedom) / \"Gluperde lutaju daleko\" (Jerks Wander Far) – (Jugoton 1982)\n\"Nemir i strast\" (Restlessness and Passion) / \"Doviđenja na Vlaškom drumu\" (Farewell on the Valachian Road) – (Jugoton 1983)\nKlinček stoji pod oblokom (A Carnation Grows Under the Window ) / Flash (Jugoton 1983.) from the album \"Krivo srastanje\"\nMon ami / Duboko u tebi (My Love/Deep Inside You) (Jugoton 1984.) from the album \"Krivo srastanje\"\n\"The Balkans\" / \"Pretty Women Passing Through Town\" / \"Vondel Park\"  (Marginal Face Production 1985)\n\n\n== Videography ==\nZadovoljština (Zagreb, live concert, 1988)\nKlincek stoji pod oblokom (Video compilation, 1990)\nDas Ist Johnny (Sarajevo, live film, 1991)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1] – Azra YouTube Channel"

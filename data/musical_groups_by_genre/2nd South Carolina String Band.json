    "text": "The 2nd South Carolina String Band was a band of Civil War re-enactors who recreate American popular music of the 1800s with authentic instruments and in period style. The group claims to \"perform Civil War music as authentically as possible . . . as it truly sounded to the soldiers of the Civil War.\"\nAccording to the band's official website, the group formed in August 1989. The founding members--consisting of Joe Ewers, Fred Ewers, John Frayler, Dave Goss and Bob Beeman-- were amateurs who played a variety of 19th-century instruments, including banjo, bones, drum, fiddle, guitar, and tambourine. They began by playing informally during re-enactment campaigns. They eventually moved to playing dances and concerts. Today, the roster comprises seven members, including players of the fife, flute, and penny whistle.\nThe 2nd South Carolina String Band has released six albums through Palmetto Productions. Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has featured their music in his films Mark Twain and Jazz. The band appears in the film Gods and Generals, directed by Ronald F. Maxwell, and their music appears on the soundtrack. In November 2004, the band received the Stephen Collins Foster Award for their preservation of 19th-century American song. The band's last personnel includes: Joe Ewers (banjo), Fred Ewers (fiddle), Dave Goss (guitar), Bob Beeman (tambourine & bones), Mike Paul (fiddle), Joe Whitney (flute) and Tom DiGiuseppe (banjo).\nPast band members have included Marty Grody (fife, tin whistle), John Frayler (military drum), and Greg Hernandez (fife).\nThe band disbanded in 2019.\nThey reunited for one last concert on November 15, 2024 in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania at the Gettysburg Middle School.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Monmouth Tapes (1991)\nSouthern Soldier (1997)\nHard Road (2001; the best of We're Tenting Tonight (1991) and We are a Band of Brothers (1993))\nIn High Cotton (2002)\nDulcem Melodies (2006)\nLightning in a Jar [Live] (2008)\nStrike the Tent!

    "text": "The Soldier String Quartet was a string quartet, founded in 1984 by composer and violinist Dave Soldier, that specialized in performing a fusion of classical and popular music. The quartet proved a training ground for many subsequent experimental classical groups and performers, including violinists Regina Carter and Todd Reynolds, and performed at venues ranging from the classic punk rock club CBGBs to Carnegie Hall and the Lincoln Center.\nFrom 1984 to 2004, in addition to a large repertoire of original compositions and transcriptions of blues, jazz and hip-hop by Soldier, the group premiered over 100 compositions including major works by Teo Macero, Leroy Jenkins, Phill Niblock, Zeena Parkins, Fred Frith, Jonas Hellborg, Elliott Sharp, Alvin Curran, and Ivan Wyschnegradsky.\nThey also performed and recorded with many rock, pop, and jazz acts including Guided by Voices, Van Dyke Parks, Jesse Harris, Butch Morris, Tony Williams, Lambchop, Bob Neuwirth, Bill Laswell, Ric Ocasek, Amina Claudine Myers, Plastic People of the Universe, Lee Ranaldo, Joanne Brackeen, Myra Melford, Sussan Deyhim, and Lenny Pickett. From 1992 to 1998 the Soldier String Quartet were the touring and recording group with John Cale and occasional other members of the Velvet Underground often supplemented with steel guitarist B.J. Cole. The arrangements for the Cale group, written by Soldier, include his metal violin solos on \"Heartbreak Hotel\" and \"Fragments of a Rainy Season\".\nThe quartet helped introduce transcription and arrangements of previously unnoted music to the chamber music repertoire, including a CD of arrangements of Jimi Hendrix pieces led by flutist Robert Dick, and album of jazz standards also with Robert Dick, and an album of Delta and Chicago blues.\n\n\n== Performers ==\nviolins: Dave Soldier, Laura Seaton, Regina Carter, Marlene Rice, Lisa Terry, Rob Thomas, Mark Feldman, Sam Bardfeld\nviola: Ron Lawrence, Martha Mooke, Judith Insell, Drew Tretick\ncello: Dawn Avery, Mary Wooten\nbass: Ratzo Harris, Richard Bona, Mark Dresser, Kermit Driscoll, Jerome Harris\npercussion: Michael Suchorsky, Kevin Norton, Valarie Naranjo, Steve Arguelles, Ben Perowsky, Jim Black, Jonathan Kane\nvocalists: Tiyeâ€™ Giraud, Jason White, Jimmy Justice, Shelley Hirsch, Amina Claudine Myers, Bobby Radcliffe\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSequence Girls, Soldier String Quartet (1988, Rift Records)\nSojourner Truth, Soldier String Quartet (1991, Mulatta)\nShe's Lightning When She Smiles, Soldier String Quartet (1966 NewTone Records)\nJazz Standards on Mars,  Soldier String Quartet with Robert Dick (1997, Enja)\nInspect for Damaged Gods, Soldier String Quartet (2004, Mulatta)\nDave Soldier \"In Four Color: music for string quartet\", performed by the Soldier String Quartet and the PUBLIQuartet (2015, Mulatta)\nBob Neuwirth, John Cale Last Day on Earth (1994, MCA)\nElliott Sharp \"Tessalation Row\" (1987, SST)\nElliott Sharp \"Larynx\" Elliott Sharp & Carbon (1987, SST)\nElliott Sharp \"Hammer, Anvil, Stirrup (1989, SST )\nElliott Sharp \"Twistmap (1991, EarRational)\nElliott Sharp \"Cryptoid Fragments\" (1993, Extreme Records)\nElliott Sharp \"Xeno-Codex\" (1996, Tzadik)\nElliott Sharp \"Rheo/Umbra\" (1998, Zoar)\nElliott Sharp \"String Quartets\" 1986-1996 (2003, Tzadik)\nGuided by Voices Do the Collapse (1999, TVT)\nGuided by Voices Hold on Hope (2000, EP, TVT)\nGuided by Voices Isolation Drills (2001, TVT)\nJesse Harris While the Music Lasts, (2004, Virgin)\nJohn Cale Walking on Locusts, (1996, Rykodisc)\nJohn Cale Eat/Kiss: Music for the Films by Andy Warhol, (1997, Rykodisc)\nJohn Cale Fragments of a Rainy Season, (1992/2016, Rykodisc)\nJonas Hellborg & Tony Williams The Word,  (1992, Island)\nLeroy Jenkins Themes & Improvisations on the Blues, (1994, CRI)\nNicolas Collins A Dark & Stormy Night, (1992, Trace Elements)\nPhill Niblock Early Winter, (1994, XI)\nRobert Dick Third Stone from the Sun, (1993, New World)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nKozinn, Allan (July 28, 1999). \"One Life To Live?

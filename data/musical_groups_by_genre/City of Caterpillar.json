    "text": "City of Caterpillar is an American post-hardcore band from Richmond, Virginia, formed in 2000. They have released a split with Pg. 99, two studio albums, and a full-length compilation of demos and live tracks. Their songs, some of which are over 10 minutes long, are often characterized by melodic post-rock passages building up into chaotic outbursts.\nCity of Caterpillar shared band members with Pg. 99, Darkest Hour, Stop It!!, Enemy Soil, Kilara, Monotonashhfuck, and later Majority Rule. They broke up in December 2003, with Jeff and Kevin going on to join Haram as well as forming the bands Malady and Verse En Coma (the latter also featuring Ryan Parrish), and Brandon and Pat forming Ghastly City Sleep.\nThe band announced a string of reunion shows across the east coast of the United States in 2016. News of the bands reunion came after Repeater Records reissued their self-titled album. The band also announced a European tour for the summer of 2017 and a Japanese tour in the summer of 2018. City Of Caterpillar announced a new album in August 2022 titled \"Mystic Sisters\" set to be released on Relapse Records as well as dates for an upcoming tour. Following the announcement Mystic Sisters was released on  September 30, 2022.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nBrandon Evans - vocals, guitar (2000-2003, 2016–present)\nJeff Kane - guitar (2000-2003, 2016–present)\nKevin Longendyke - vocals, bass (2000-2003, 2016–present)\nRyan Parrish - drums (2000-2002, 2016–present)\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nAdam Juresko - bass (2000)\n\n\n=== Touring Members ===\nPat Broderick - drums (2001-2003)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nCity of Caterpillar (2002, Level Plane)\nMystic Sisters (2022, Relapse Records)\nSingles and EPs\nSplit 7-inch with System 2600 (2000, Sea of Dead Pirates)\nDocument #9: A Split Personality split 7-inch with Pg. 99 (2001, Level Plane)\nLive In New York City (2001, Level Plane)\nUnreleased Demos (2013, Robotic Empire)  (released on the Robotic Empire SoundCloud page)\nAs the Curtains Dim; (Little White Lie) (2016, Robotic Empire)\nDriving Spain Up a Wall (2017, Repeater Records)\nCompilation albums\nDemo and Live Recording (2002, Level Plane)\nComplete Discography (2018, Long Legs Long Arms)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCity of Caterpillar page at Level Plane Records Archived 2006-03-27 at the Wayback Machine\nCity of Caterpillar Final Demos"

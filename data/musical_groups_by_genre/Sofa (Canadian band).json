    "text": "Sofa was a Montreal-based band that was originally active from 1993 to 1997, becoming active again in 2021. The group is best known for being the first group to release material on record label Constellation Records; bandmember Ian Ilavsky (later a member of Re: and Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band) was a co-founder of the label.\n\n\n== History ==\nMost of Sofa's songs were written and played in a 10' x 10' room and were later presented in live shows, after which they were discarded. The band was made up of four members. They self-released two albums on cassette and with Constellation Records had two more releases (one 7\" and one CD). The full-length, Grey, received positive reviews from several Canadian press outlets. One member of the band, Ian, is also the co-founder (along with Don) of Constellation Records, an independent record label.\nSix months after the release of the full-length Grey, the group disbanded. The song \"String of Lights\" was included on the Constellation compilation disc Song of the Silent Land; one reviewer noted the song's \"delicate emotion reminiscent of the Dirty Three\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nScott Clarkson - bass\nIan Ilavsky - guitar, organ, piano\nKeith Marchand - drums\nBrad Todd - voice, tape\n\n\n== Discography ==\nTest Tone (self-release/Rhyzome Records; 1994)\nTown Unsafe (self-release; 1995)\nRecord (self-release; 1995)\nNew Era Building (Constellation Records; 1997) - includes two songs from 'Record'\nGrey (Constellation Records; 1997)\nSource Crossfire (Constellation Records; 2021)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSofa at Constellation Records"

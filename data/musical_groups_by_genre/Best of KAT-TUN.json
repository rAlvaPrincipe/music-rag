    "text": "\"Best of KAT-TUN\" is the debut album by Japanese boy band KAT-TUN, released in Japan on March 22, 2006 by J-One Records. Despite the title, it is not a greatest hits compilation album. Seven songs on the record, however, were part of KAT-TUN's live tour set list prior to their debut and were already familiar with longtime fans.\nThe album was part of a tripartite release also consisting of the group's debut single and its tie-in DVD. All three releases were immensely successful on the Oricon albums, singles and DVD charts with \"Real Face\" and \"Real Face Film\" being certified as the best-selling single and domestic music DVD of the year respectively. The album itself was the eleventh best-selling album of the year.\n\n\n== Album information ==\nMost of the songs on the album were written for KAT-TUN either by in-house Johnny's Entertainment songwriters or lyricists with a track record of successful hit records for other artists. KAT-TUN members, with the exception of Junnosuke Taguchi, co-wrote 3 songs for the album which were sung as duets. All rap lyrics were also written by Koki Tanaka himself.\n\n\n== Chart performance and reception ==\nIn its first week of release, Best of KAT-TUN sold 556,548 copies in Japan, the highest first-week sales for the group to date. The album actually debuted at number 1 on the Oricon daily album charts the day before its release since its official release date fell on a national holiday. Therefore, it didn't officially chart for the week. KAT-TUN were awarded six awards at the 21st Japan Gold Disc Awards (the Japanese equivalent of the Grammy Awards) with Best of KAT-TUN named on \"The Best 10 Albums (Domestic)\" list. Soon after the home success, Best of KAT-TUN was then released in Taiwan and Thailand in 2006 by EMI Taiwan and EMI Thailand, respectively.\nIt stayed on the Oricon Top 30 Albums chart for 7 weeks with a total of 743,359 copies sold at the end of its chart-run. Oricon certified the album as the 11th best-selling record of the year and was later certified Triple Platinum by RIAJ denoting over 750,000 shipments.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"She Said...\" (Ryo Taguchi, Axel G, Katsumi Ohnishi, FLYING GRIND, JOKER) – 3:43\n\"Never Again\" (SPIN, Steven Lee, Joey Carbone FLYING GRIND, JOKER) – 3:49\n\"I Like It\" (Sean Thomas, SPIN, FLYING GRIND) – 4:26\n\"Miracle\" (hamai, Minoru Kumorita, Seikou Nagaoka) - 4:22\n\"Blue Tuesday\" (Yoji Kubota, Arata Tanimoto, Tomoki Ishizuka) – 4:33\n\"Rhodesia\" (CHOKKAKU) - 5:06\n\"Gold\" (Stefan Aberg, Stefan Engblom, SPIN, FLYING GRIND, JOKER) - 4:53\n\"Wilds of My Heart\" (SPIN, zero-rock, Gyo Kitagawa, JOKER) – 3:59\n\"Special Happiness\"1 (K², Gajin, Yoshihiko Chino) – 5:02\n\"One on One\"2 (JOKER, Yuichi Nakamaru, mo'doo-, Izutsu \"Growth\" Shintaro, Takahito Eguchi)  – 4:58\n\"Butterfly\"3 (Jin Akanishi, Tatsuya Ueda, velvetronica) – 4:52\n\"Rush of Light\" (ma-saya, Watermelon 6, CHOKKAKU) - 4:26\n\"Harukana Yakusoku (ハルカナ約束)\" (SPIN, Kousuke Morimoto, ha-j, JOKER) - 3:53\n\"Precious One\" (Kaori Niimi, Yuuki Shirai, Yoshinao Mikami, ha-j) - 5:15\n\"Real Face #1\" (Shikao Suga, Tak Matsumoto, Akihito Tokunaga, JOKER) - 4:58\n1 Kazuya Kamenashi and Junnosuke Taguchi duet.\n2 Koki Tanaka and Yuichi Nakamaru duet.\n3 Jin Akanishi and Tatsuya Ueda duet.\n\n\n=== Sales and certifications ===\n\n\n== Chart positions ==\n\n\n== References =="

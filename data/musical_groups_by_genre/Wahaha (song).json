    "text": "\"Wahaha\" (ワッハッハー, Wahhahhā) is the eighth single released by the Japanese boyband Kanjani8. The single featured two versions, a limited and regular edition. The limited edition single came with a seven-page photobook.\nBecause this single was the eighth one that they released, they played on the pronunciation of the number 8, hachi, with the pronunciation of the Japanese word for bee, also hachi, and used it for hidden gag in the CD's promotion and jacket art. Shota Yasuda dressed up like a bee and was featured in the promotional video and limited edition CD booklet.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== Regular Edition ===\n\" Wahaha \"\n\" Dare yori mo Suki dakara \"\n\" BJ \"\n\" Wahaha  <Original Karaoke> \"\n\n\n=== Limited Edition ===\n\" Wahaha \"\n\" Dare yori mo Suki dakara \"\n\" Wahaha  <Original Karaoke> \"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References =="

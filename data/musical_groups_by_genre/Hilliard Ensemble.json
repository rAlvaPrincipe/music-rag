    "text": "Hilliard Ensemble was a British male vocal quartet originally devoted to the performance of early music. The group was named after the Elizabethan miniaturist painter Nicholas Hilliard. Founded in 1974, the group disbanded in 2014.\nAlthough most of its work focused on music of the Medieval and Renaissance periods, the Hilliard Ensemble also performed contemporary music, working frequently with the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and included in its concerts works by John Cage, Gavin Bryars, Giya Kancheli, and Heinz Holliger.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Membership ===\nThe group was founded by Paul Hillier, Errol Girdlestone, Paul Elliott, and David James, although the membership was flexible until Hillier left in 1990. After that, the core members were David James (counter-tenor), Rogers Covey-Crump (tenor/high tenor), John Potter (tenor), and Gordon Jones (bass), except that in 1998 John Potter was replaced by Steven Harrold.\n\n\n=== Recordings ===\nThe Hilliard Ensemble, under Paul Hillier, had an extensive discography with EMI's Reflexe early music series during the 1980s. The ensemble then recorded mainly for the ECM label. In 1994, when popular interest in Gregorian chant was at its height, the ensemble released the CD Officium, an unprecedented collaboration with the Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek. The disc became one of ECM's biggest-selling releases, reaching the pop charts in several European countries and receiving five gold discs in sales. Officium's sequel, the 2-CD set Mnemosyne, followed in 1999. The third album, Officium Novum, was released in 2010. Their recordings have also been included in Craig Wright's Listening to Music textbook for music students and music appreciation.\n\n\n=== Performances ===\nIn 2005 the ensemble took part in the Rheingau Musik Festival's composer's portrait of Arvo Pärt, together with the Rostock Motet Choir. In 2008 the Hilliard Ensemble premiered Heiner Goebbels' avant-garde staged concert I went to the house but did not enter at the 2008 Edinburgh International Festival, repeated at the Berliner Festspiele.\n\n\n=== New music ===\nIn 2009 the ensemble premiered five new works: Guido Morini's Una Iliade, Fabio Vacchi's Memoria Italiana, Steffen Schleiermacher's Die Beschwörung der Trunkenen Oase, Simon Bainbridge's Tenebrae and Wolfgang Rihm's Et Lux. In September 2010 the Hilliard Ensemble joined the London Philharmonic Choir and Orchestra for the world premiere of Matteo D'Amico's Flight from Byzantium at the Royal Festival Hall, London.\n\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nThey also performed three pieces by Guillaume Dufay: Moribus et genere, Vergene bella and Lamentatio sanctae matris ecclesiae Constantinopolitanae.\nOn 15 November 2010, the group appeared at Church of St. Paul the Apostle in New York to perform Kjartan Sveinsson's Cage a Swallow Can’t You but You Can’t Swallow a Cage.\n\n\n=== Disbanding ===\nThe Hilliard Ensemble decided to disband after 41 years and gave their final concert on 20 December 2014 at the Wigmore Hall, London.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\n\n\n=== Harmonia Mundi ===\n1982: Cipriano de Rore: Le Vergine (LP, HM 1107)\n1982: Medieval English Music (HMC 901106)\n1983: Sumer is icumen in (HMC 901154)\n1983: The Singing Club (HMC 901153)\n\n\n=== EMI Reflexe ===\n1980: Lionel Power: Messen und Motetten (LP, EMI Reflexe 1C 069-46 402)\n1982: John Dunstable: Motets (EMI Reflexe CDC 7 49002 2)\n1983: Josquin Desprez: Motets and chansons (EMI Reflexe CDC 7 49209 2)\n1983: Schütz: Matthäus-Passion (EMI Reflexe CDC 7 49200 2)\n1984: J.

    "text": "The David Grisman Quintet is a self-styled alternative bluegrass/acoustic jazz band founded by David Grisman in 1975 in San Francisco, California, US. The quintet draws from genres including Bill Monroe's bluegrass legacy and Django Reinhardt's 1930s swing. Since its formation, the Quintet's members have included guitarist Tony Rice and multiinstrumentalists Mark O'Connor, Mike Marshall, Darol Anger and Jon Sholle. The Quintet has performed and recorded with guests such as violinist Stephane Grapelli, and remains active. The National Public Radio program Car Talk uses the band's instrumental \"Dawggy Mountain Breakdown\" as its theme music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe following albums have been released by the David Grisman Quintet:\n\nThe David Grisman Quintet - 1977\nHot Dawg - 1978\nQuintet '80 - 1980\nMondo Mando - 1981\nDawg '90 - 1990\nDawgwood - 1993\nDawganova - 1995\nDGQ-20 - 1996\nDawgnation - 2002\nDawg's Groove - 2006\n\n\n== David Grisman Quintet timeline ==\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nwww.dawgnet.com, official website of David Grisman"

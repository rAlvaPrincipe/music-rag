The MacPhees are brothers, and Buchanan grew up next door to them. They met MacDonald in high school. \nChucky Danger's debut full-length album, Colour, was released in 2006. The band won the 2006 East Coast Music Award for Pop Recording of the Year for their EP 6-pack.\nThey received three nominations at the 2007 East Coast Music Awards: Group Recording of the Year, Single of the Year (\"Marching Machine\"), and Rock Recording of the Year. Their third release, Chucky Danger, was released in August of that year.\nThey were nominated for four awards at the 2008 East Coast Music Awards.\nIn February, 2008, the band officially changed their name to Paper Lions. They then completed several tours including a 7-show tour with the American band, Cake, and released an album Trophies, which appeared on the !Earshot National Top 50 Chart in October 2010. Their song \"Stay Here for a While\" made them finalists in the 2010 John Lennon Songwriting Competition.\nPaper Lions were featured on CBC Radio, and the video for their single \"Lost the War\" was nominated for a 2010 CBC Radio 3 Bucky Award.\nThe band performed on September 29, 2010, on MTV Live and  their track \"Lost the War\" was featured in several episodes of the ABC television show, Greek.\nIn 2010 Paper Lions were selected to perform at the 2010 World Expo in China, as well as at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, BC, and at the 2010 Paralympics in Whistler, BC.\nPaper Lions signed in September 2010 to the MuseBox label for the official release of their album Trophies; they then headed out on a cross-Canada tour.

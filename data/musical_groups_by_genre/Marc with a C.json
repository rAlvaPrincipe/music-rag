    "text": "Marc with a C is the stage name of Marc Sirdoreus (born January 17, 1978), an indie pop singer-songwriter from Orlando, Florida. He has released fifteen official albums and numerous other EPs and compilations since 2002.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSirdoreus first began playing music in the Central Florida area with an alternative rock band before releasing his first solo album, Human Slushy, in 2002. Riding the local success of the first single, \"Why Don't Girls Like Me?\", Marc with a C won the Orlando Weekly's Best Acoustic Act award in 2003.\nHowever, production on his second release, 2004's Bubblegum Romance, was troubled. Initially conceived and recorded as what Sirdoreus describes as \"a big ol' arena rock affair\", two years of work was scrapped and re-recorded in two days with Chris Zabriskie producing and playing drums.\nSirdoreus has released one album a year since that time, including This World is Scary as Fuck, Life's So Hard, Normal Bias, Linda Lovelace for President, and Pop! Pop! Pop!. He has also released various EPs, hits compilations, and \"Official Bootlegs\" of live shows. In 2009, Sirdoreus announced he would be putting the mp3s of all of his albums online for free, in addition to selling CDs and mp3s through iTunes.\nMarc with a C is known in the Orlando area for \"marathon\" live shows that often span nearly three hours and include covers ranging from The Who to songs from Rocky Horror Picture Show sequel Shock Treatment. Marc with a C performed at the Athens PopFest in 2008, and made an appearance on WMBR's \"Phoning It In\" show shortly thereafter. Marc would return to the festival in 2011. Marc with a C also performed at nerd music festival Nerdapalooza in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In both 2010 and 2011, Marc With a C was voted Orlando's Best Indie Act in the Orlando Weekly's yearly readers poll.\nIn August 2021, it was announced that Needlejuice Records had acquired the rights to Marc's \"canon\" catalog for future reissues, following their releases of The Obscurity Trilogy in 2019 and Shock Treatment (Interpretations) in 2021.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nHuman Slushy (2002)\nBubblegum Romance (2004)\nThis World is Scary as Fuck (2005)\nLife's So Hard (2006)\nNormal Bias (2007)\nLinda Lovelace for President (2008)\nLosing Salt (2009)\nPop!

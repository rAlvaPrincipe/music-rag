    "text": "Aleka's Attic was an alternative folk/rock band from Gainesville, Florida, formed by River Phoenix and Josh Greenbaum in April 1987.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original line up of Aleka's Attic included River Phoenix as lead singer and guitarist, his sister Rain on vocals and occasional percussion, Tim Hankins on viola, Josh McKay on bass and Josh Greenbaum on drums.\nThe band's name comes from the fictional Aleka, a poet-philosopher who gathered friends in his attic to discuss his ideas. When Aleka dies, his friends form a band to share his beliefs with others through music.\nRiver was offered a two-year development deal with Island Records to develop the band and record a marketable album, which was not accomplished in the time allotted due to River's ongoing film schedule. Island Records opted out of the deal based on their belief that the material lacked marketability. River decided to record the album independently.\n\n\n== The unreleased album ==\nThough Rain spent two years working through unfinished tracks and mixing performances, no finished product was ever completed. The release of the album, with the proposed titles Never Odd Or Even and Zero, was postponed indefinitely due to River's death. The Phoenix family continues to work toward an official release.  \nAn original track list for bootlegs of Zero/Never Odd Or Even:\n\nAlone We Elope\nBelow Beloved\nBliss Is...\nDog God\nGet Anything\nNote To A Friend\nSafety Pins and Army Boots\nScales & Fishnails\nSenile Felines\nYou're So Ostentatious\nIn 1997, Phoenix's friend Michael Stipe of R.E.M. bought the rights to all of Aleka's Attic's material from Island Records.\nHomemade versions of an album and many other songs by the band can be found on various sites throughout the internet.\nIn the film Sneakers, whose cast includes Aleka's Attic member River Phoenix, the character played by Dan Aykroyd wears an Aleka's Attic T-shirt in one scene.\nIn December 2018, Rain Phoenix announced on Instagram that Aleka's Attic singles would be released in 2019 with the album being released eventually.\nRed Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea appeared on two unreleased Aleka's Attic songs to mark River Phoenix's 50th birthday.\nIn July 2020, it was reported that Aleka's Attic heavily influenced a novel by British novelist Guy Mankowski, titled \"Dead Rock Stars\".\n\n\n== Released tracks ==\nThe group sold tapes between 1989 and 1990 with the songs \"Goldmine\", \"Too Many Colors\", \"Across The Way\" and \"Blue Period\".\n\"Across The Way\", which was written by River and Josh McKay, was included on the 1989 PETA benefit album Tame Yourself.\n\"Note To A Friend\", featuring River's friend Michael \"Flea\" Balzary of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on bass, was released on the 1996 compilation 'In Defense Of Animals: Volume II'\nThe song \"Too Many Colors\", was featured on the unreleased soundtrack of \"My Own Private Idaho\", a 1991 film starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves, directed by Gus Van Sant.\nThe songs  \"Where Iâ€™d Gone\" and \"Scales & Fishnails\" were released on the album \"Time Gone\" by Rain Phoenix in 2019.

    "text": "Big Chief was an American funk rock band from Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\n\n== History ==\nBig Chief was founded in 1989 by several veterans of the Michigan hardcore punk scene, including Barry Henssler, who had been a member of Necros. They began attracting major label attention even before releasing any songs. After the release of their debut seven-inch record, \"Brake Torque\", Sub Pop offered to put out another seven-inch single. After several more single releases, the group compiled them on Drive It Off, released on Get Hip Recordings in 1991. Later that year, the group released its debut album, Face, in Germany; Sub Pop issued the album for the American market in mid-1992. In 1993, Sub Pop released their sophomore album, Mack Avenue Skullgame, after which the group switched to major label Capitol Records, who released the group's third and final LP, Platinum Jive, in 1994. The group disbanded in 1996, though it kept up a fanzine, called Motorbooty, until the end of the decade; Motorbooty featured illustrations by guitarist Mark Dancey. Bassist Mark O'Brien became a member of Numbers; vocalist Barry Henssler worked in Chicago clubs as DJ Chamberweed; and Phil Durr played with the groups Five Horse Johnson, Giant Brain, Luder, and Variac.\nOn January 11, 2019, Phill Durr died of a heart attack at age 53 while visiting family in Germany. \n\n\n== Members ==\nBarry Henssler - vocals\nThornetta Davis - vocals\nMike Danner - drums\nMatt O'Brien - bass\nMark Dancey - guitar\nPhil DÃ¼rr - guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDrive It Off (Get Hip Recordings, 1991)\nFace (Sub Pop, 1992)\nMack Avenue Skullgame (Sub Pop, 1993)\nPlatinum Jive (Capitol Records, 1994)\n\n\n== References =="

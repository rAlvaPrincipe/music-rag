    "text": "Painkiller (stylized as PainKiller, previously known as Pain Killer) is an avant-garde jazz and grindcore band that formed in 1991. Later albums incorporated elements of ambient and dub.\nThe three primary members of Painkiller were John Zorn on saxophone, Bill Laswell on bass guitar and Mick Harris on drums. Zorn and Laswell work in the New York avant-garde jazz music scene. Harris was the drummer for the grindcore band Napalm Death. Harris' blast beats inspired Zorn to create his signature style, forming improvisational groups like Naked City that merged disparate genres into a unique scene. Several musicians have made guest appearances both live and in the studio, including Buckethead, Kevin Sharp of Brutal Truth, Yamatsuka Eye, Mike Patton, Koichi Makigami of Hikashu, Justin Broadrick and G. C. Green of Godflesh, Fred Frith, and Keiji Haino of Fushitsusha.\nHarris left the band in 1995 to dedicate himself to computer music. Zorn and Laswell resurrected Painkiller and played with Yoshida Tatsuya of Ruins on drums. Hamid Drake joined the band for Zorn's 50th Birthday shows at Tonic in New York City. That show (which also featured Patton as a guest) was released as a live album by Tzadik.  \nOn June 23, 2008, Painkiller performed Their Last Show In Citè de la musique Paris, France with the original line-up of Zorn, Laswell, and Harris, along with an appearance by Fred Frith and Patton.\nIn early 2024 the band reunited again, though with Harris on electronics and effects rather than a conventional drum kit. They announced the release of a new album, Samsara, in November 2024.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current lineup ===\nJohn Zorn – saxophone, vocals (1991–1995, 1997–1998, 2003, 2004–2006, 2008, 2024–present)\nBill Laswell – bass guitar (1991–1995, 1997–1998, 2003, 2004–2006, 2008, 2024–present), samples (1994)\nMick Harris – drums, vocals (1991–1995, 1997–1998, 2008), electronics, effects (1994, 2024–present)\n\n\n=== Former Reunions members ===\nHamid Drake – drums (2003)\nTatsuya Yoshida – drums, vocals (2004–2006)\n\n\n=== Guest/session musicians ===\nJustin Broadrick – guitar, drum machine, vocals (1991) (on Buried Secrets (1992), tracks \"Buried Secrets\", \"The Toll\")\nG.C.

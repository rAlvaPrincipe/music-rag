    "text": "Colin Dussault's Blues Project is a five-piece blues-rock group who released songs such as \"Little Chicken Wing Girl\", \"Good Booty & BBQ\", \"O.J. Simpson's DNA\", and \"Tidioute, Pennsylvania Revisited\"; and their 1998 remake of James Taylor's \"Fire and Rain\". The band's releases, live shows, and work schedule have resulted in the group being called the \"Hardest Working Band in Northern Ohio.\" Their tag line is \"Our Music is better than it sounds.\"\nFormed in 1989 in Cleveland, Ohio, Colin Dussault's Blues Project is a harmonica-driven, blues-based rock 'n' soul band. Founder and leader Dussault has been called \"a powerful, yet warm singer\" with a \"howling phlegmatic voice that sounds like Bobby Bland trying to scream over the roar of a DC-9\" with a blues harp style \"...and \"a must-hear not only for blues fans but for fans of Cleveland's rich musical history.\" According to Carlo Wolff, his \"stage presence, charisma and wonderful voice are the makings of a national blues figure\". His harmonica style is influenced by the Chicago blues of the '50s, the British blues of the '60s, and American country and folk idioms. An official endorser of Hohner harmonicas since 1994, Dussault plays the Hohner Big River model in second position, or cross-harp style.\n\n\n== History ==\nDussault began his musical career in 1985 as a sophomore at Lakewood High School, with the help of David Treaster, a classmate and classically trained guitarist. The son of watercolor artist Richard Treaster, David Treaster exposed Dussault to B.B. King, Albert King, Freddie King, Johnny Winter, Stevie Ray Vaughan and the Allman Brothers. The two blues fans shortly teamed up with other classmates to form the short-lived Blues Junction, which performed at house parties, a battle of the bands and a high school talent show.\nDussault began to play professionally after graduating from Lakewood High in 1987. In the summer of that year, he sat in on harmonica with big band leader and CBS Records Recording Artist Al Serafini at a wedding reception the Dussault family was attending. Serafini, who over twenty years earlier had booked gigs for the Blackweles, a band that featured Colin's father, Artie Dussault, on bass, invited the younger Dussault onstage. Dussault then found work with various local bands including the Delgado Brothers, Bill Dawg and the Extraordinaires, and Hitman. Eventually, Hitman evolved into Colin Dussault's Blues Project, which debuted at the Ultimate Sports Bar in Lakewood on Saturday, May 13, 1989.\nThe band was soon playing all over Greater Cleveland. It now performs more than 300 shows a year at venues such as blues clubs, biker bars, and upscale wineries, from the Lake Erie Islands to upstate New York, and often opens up for national touring blues and rock artists. Its membership has included alumni of such well-known Cleveland bands as Moonlight Drive, the Saxons, Gary Lewis and the Playboys, Calabash, Mr. Stress Blues Band, Anne E. DeChant, Jehovah's Waitresses, the Pony Express Band, and I-Tal. The current lineup, besides Dussault, is charter member Jimmy Feeney (guitar); John Atzberger (bass, vocals); Brent Lane (keyboards); Steve Savesky (drums) and roadie Robbie Green aka Robo, the Dali-Robbie, The Robbie Lama, ElToro-Roho and The Emporror Robo-Eeato.\nIn 2010, Dussault allied with Tie-Dye Harvest's Jim Tigue and Michael Stanley Band and Wish You were Here bassist/vocalist Eric \"Eroc\" Sosinski to form Colin Dussault's Acoustic Side Project.\nIn 2018 Dussault cowrote, recorded and released a CD single titled \"A Song for our Children\". The song was written in the aftermath of the Parkland, Florida school shootings. Proceeds from the sale of the CD single were donated to Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America.\n\n\n== Performances ==\nThe band have opened for blues performers and rock groups including Johnny Winter, Glen Schwartz, Valerie Wellington, Big Jack Johnson and the Oilers, Joe Bonamassa, and Duke Robillard; Billy Branch, James Cotton, and Carey Bell; John Mayall and Chris Duarte, Jonny Lang, Buckwheat Zydeco, Robert Lockwood, Jr.; Bad Company and Eddie Money; Steppenwolf; Kim Wilson and the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Buddy Guy, Steve Miller and George Thorogood, Blue Öyster Cult, Ronnie Earle, Valerie Wellington, Robert Lockwood Jr., Chicago Legendary Blues Band, and Sugar Ray and the Broadcasters, Elvin Bishop Band with Little Smokey, Roomful of Blues, the Nighthawks, Anson Funderburgh and the Rockets, Bob Margolin's Rolling Fork Review, Hubert Sumlin and Levon Helm, and Michael Stanley.\nColin Dussault appeared with the band Nightbridge at a July 1998 political fundraiser for U.S. Senate Candidate Mary O. Boyle that featured an appearance by then first lady Hillary Clinton. Colin Dussault and his band also performed with the band Roosevelt and Bruce Springsteen at the 2004 Election Eve Rally for Presidential hopeful John Kerry held at Mall C in Downtown Cleveland on November 1, 2004. On November 26, 2004, Colin Dussault and his band appeared live on Cleveland's Fox 8 News Morning show performing \"Sweet Home Chicago\" with Dan Aykroyd in conjunction with the opening of the Cleveland House of Blues.\nColin Dussault has released 11 self-produced and self-marketed compact disc recordings to date on his Erica Records/Buddha Belly Productions label. Dussault has also appeared on copious other recordings by Cleveland artists as a session player. The band's music can be heard on Cleveland's WNCX 98.5 Classic Rock who continually include \"Fire and Rain,\" \"Good Booty and BBQ\",\" and \"Little Chicken Wing Girl\" in their playlists. \"Good Booty and BBQ,\" written by Greg Bandy along with Colin Dussault, has been covered by several local and national acts including Chicago's Howard and the White Boys who included the song on their 2007 CD \"Made in Chicago,\" released and distributed by Evidence Music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nColin Dussault, His Blues Project and Friends (1994)\nColin Dussault's Blues Project Recorded Live at the Brother's Lounge (1995)\nMoving On (1998)\nHighlights (2001)\nOfficial Bootleg-Live at Tri-C (2003)\nThe Best Of-Greatest Hits Collection (2004)\nNot Tonight Baby I've Got the Blues (2004)\nWatch This!

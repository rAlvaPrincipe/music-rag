Taylor Glasby of GQ stated that their \"smokey eye make-up, embellished jackets, chokers, and leather trousers, with bondage-style leather harnesses under double-breasted suits\", made it \"sensual, provocative, and divisive but Monsta X have developed a proud ownership of this duality\". The group's stylists, most notably Kim A Yeon and Kim Minseo have received praise for styling many of their \"heavy-hitting looks.\" Natalie Morin described the group's fashion for Refinery29 as \"usually some mixture of blacks, golds, and reds, faux leather, and dramatic, smokey makeup, with an aura around them that mere mortals dare not disturb\", accenting that the group \"fit closely in many ways to what Koreans would describe as the \"beast\" idol aesthetic – dark, edgy, traditionally \"masculine\" presenting – as opposed to the softer, cute \"flower boy\" aesthetic found among many male K-pop groups\".\nThe group was also commended for using traditional Korean inspired elements during their performances, including hanbok-inspired outfits and the use of the taepyeongso. Their modernized take on the men's hanbok, \"in black and gold prints flowing past their waists like a cape, with fitted pants of mostly gold designs, and the use of the Korean drums, was also highlighted\".

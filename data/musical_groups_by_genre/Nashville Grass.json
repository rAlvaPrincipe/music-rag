    "text": "The Nashville Grass was a bluegrass band founded by Lester Flatt in 1969, after the end of his partnership with Earl Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys. Flatt hired most of the Foggy Mountain Boys for his new band.\nOver the years, as with most bluegrass bands, the Nashville Grass saw numerous changes in personnel, including the addition of contemporary country music star Marty Stuart, who started with Flatt at the age of 13.  Lester Flatt continued to record and perform with the Nashville Grass until his death in 1979; at that time, Curly Seckler became leader of the band.\n\n\n== Members ==\nLester Flatt (guitar)\nJohnny Johnson (guitar, bass)\nJohn Ray \"Curly\" Seckler (guitar)\nRoland White (mandolin)\nMarty Stuart (mandolin, guitar, fiddle)\nVic Jordan (banjo)\nHaskel McCormick (banjo)\nKenny Ingram (banjo)\nBlake Williams (banjo)\nPaul Warren (fiddle)\nClarence \"Tater\" Tate (fiddle)\nBurkett \"Josh\" Graves (Dobro)\nJack Martin (Dobro)\nCharlie Nixon (Dobro)\nEnglish P. \"Jake\" Tullock(bass)\nJack Hicks (bass)\nPete Corum (bass)\n\n\n== References =="

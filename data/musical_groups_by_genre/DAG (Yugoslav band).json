Although short-lasting, they were one of the most notable representatives of the Yugoslav acoustic rock scene.\nThe band consisted of Dragan Popović (guitar, vocals) and brothers Grujica (percussion, vocals) and Aleksandar Milanović (guitar, vocals). Initially, the band performed acoustic music, but on the recording of their only studio album, Sećanja (1974), they played electric instruments. The album, featuring poetic lyrics written by lyricist Marina Tucaković, was praised by the critics, but saw little commercial success, and Popović left the band, DAG ending their activity soon after.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1972-1975 ===\nThe band was formed in 1972 as an acoustic trio consisting of Dragan Popović (guitar, vocals), and brothers Grujica (percussion, vocals) and Aleksandar Milanović (guitar, vocals).

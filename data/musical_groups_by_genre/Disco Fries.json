    "text": "Disco Fries is an American DJ and music production duo from New York consisting of Nick Ditri and Danny Boselovic.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn late fall of 2004, Danny Boselovic and Nick Ditri met as roommates in their freshman year at Berklee College of Music in Boston. Nick grew up on hip-hop and New York-centric dance music and ran an independent record label. Danny was a trombone player and fan of Radiohead and technology. They started experimenting on music together in their freshman year.\nThe duo has hit the Hypem #1 spot multiple times with their releases on labels such as Cr2, Strictly Rhythm, OneLove, and Vicious Recordings. After recently being named one of VIBE Magazine \"30 DJs to Watch in 2013\", Disco Fries partnered with Novation to create a Max for Live plug-in dubbed \"Konversate\" for use with the Launchpad in their live sets. In late 2013, Disco Fries became a FabFilter Endorsed Artist.\nIn 2018, their single \"U Make Me (Zack Martino & Disco Fries Remix)\" peaked at #1 on SiriusXM's BPM.\nIn 2019, “Concrete Heart,” their collaboration with Vassy peaked at #1 on both Billboard's Dance Music Charts and Media Base Dance Radio Charts, and has tracked as the #11th most played dance song of the year. This song including 2 of their other singles this year, \"Forever\" and \"Moonlight,\" are under consideration for nominations in the 62nd Grammy Awards. They've also had \"Moonlight\" and \"Forever\" in simultaneous rotation on several different SiriusXM channels, including BPM, Pitbull's Globalization, and their remix of Domenico's \"Sirens\" in rotation on Chill.\n\n\n=== Collaboration ===\nUpon his receipt of the DJ Mag and KLM DJ Legend Award, Tiesto released a free download where Disco Fries was featured called “iTrance.\" The Tiesto and Disco Fries collaboration first began as a rumor when an Instagram video emerged with the two acts working together in the studio. As of December 2013, \"iTrance\" has earned more than 500,000 plays on SoundCloud. In early 2014, Disco Fries were chosen by Tiësto and 7 Up to be one of their Bubbling UP DJs for the #7x7UP campaign.\nThe Disco Fries recently produced two tracks on Tiesto 'A Town Called Paradise,' both \"Wasted\" featuring Matthew Koma and \"Shimmer\" featuring Christian Burns (production and writing credit). “Wasted” went Gold as certified by the RIAA for digital sales in excess of 500,000 in the USA. They've also received co-write and composer credits on Krewella \"Live For The Night\" along with the members of Cash Cash.\n\n\n=== Autonomous ===\nAutonomous is the debut EP from Disco Fries. It was self-released on 6 April 2015 by Liftoff Recordings and was preceded by \"Head In The Clouds\" featuring 311 frontman Nick Hexum. Additional features on the release include Breathe Carolina, Raine Maida of Our Lady Peace and UK artist Hope Murphy. Autonomous entered the iTunes Dance Album Chart at number 76 and peaked Top 50. Upon its release, Autonomous received positive reviews from music critics ranging from Billboard and MTV to Dancing Astronaut and KROQ. Matt Medved of Billboard stated, \"On the release's lead single, \"Head in the Clouds,\" the producers buoy Hexum's upbeat verses and radio-ready chorus with a gentle blend of buoyant chord hits, tight percussion, and subtle vocoder refrains. It's a more unapologetically accessible sound than 311 ever struck, but the Fries succeed in setting Hexum's vocals within the electronic backdrop without it feeling too forced.\". The acoustic version of \"Head In The Clouds\" premiered on Guitar World via Acoustic Nation. Regarding \"All I Wanna\" with Breathe Carolina, Rao Paoletta of MTV stated, \"Disco Fries’ latest track will make you feel like you're at the club wherever you are, from Ibiza to the elliptical and have collaborated with electro-rockers Breathe Carolina to grace your eardrums with “All I Wanna.”. The Halogen Remix for \"Born Ready\" featuring Hope Murphy went #1 on Hype Machine.\n\n\n=== Touring ===\nIn 2013, Disco Fries performed over 75 shows around the world. Notable gigs have included playing alongside Tiesto at Hakkasan in Las Vegas, Icona Pop and Krewella at Stage 48 in New York City for WKTU KTUphoria and Tommie Sunshine at the Amsterdam Dance Event in The Netherlands. The duo also completed bi-annual tours in Asia, Australia, Indonesia and Canada with a string of dates throughout mainland China, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Sydney, Perth, Toowoomba, Adelaide, Alberta, Ottawa, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labradour. On June 29, 2014 The Disco Fries played WKTU's Ktuphoria with Calvin Harris, Cash Cash, Ariana Grande, and Jennifer Lopez In early 2019, Disco Fries went on tour with Tritonal on their U & Me tour, while the second half of the year has seen them touring in support of their \"Family Affair\" single.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2020\nRehash, Vol. 2\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n2015\nAutonomous featuring 311 front man Nick Hexum, Breathe Carolina, Raine Maida of Our Lady Peace and UK artist Hope Murphy\n2017\nDF\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n2024\n\"Our House\" (with Fatman Scoop & Bingo Players)\n2021\n\"Up Til Light\" (with Sm1lo)\n\"Feel Again\" (with Shanahan)\n\"15 Minutes\" (with Damon Sharpe)\n2020\n\"Give It Back\" (with Giiants featuring Allison Park)\n\"Forever Love\" (with Bingo Players featuring Viiq)\n\"Anybody\"\n\"Believer\" (with Giiants)\n2019\n\"Part Time\" (with Modern Machines and Lena Leon)\n\"Family Affair\"\n\"Forever\" (featuring Maline)\n\"The End (Want It All)\" (with Loax featuring Jaki Nelson)\n\"Concrete Heart\" (with Vassy) - Peaked at #1 on Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart and #1 on Media Base Dance Radio Chart.

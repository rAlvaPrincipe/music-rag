    "text": "Ivanushki International (written in Russian as \"Иванушки International\") is a Russian boy band founded in Moscow in 1994.\nThe band was conceived by record producer Igor Matviyenko, and initially consisted of Andrei Grigoriev-Apollonov, Kirill Andreev, and primary vocalist Igor Sorin. They performed under several names (such as \"Apollo–Soyuz\") before settling on \"Ivanushki International\", a name meant to represent their intended blend of Russian (\"Little Ivans\") and international musical influences, and itself written half in Cyrillic, half in the Latin alphabet, with the second word read as in English.\nTheir debut album, Конечно он (Konyechno on, Of Course It's Him), was released in 1996. It included three cover versions of songs from the 1980s – \"Вселенная\" (Vselennaya, \"The Universe\"), originally performed by Alexander Ivanov, and \"Рондо\" (Rondo, \"Roundabout\"), \"Этажи\" (Etazhi, \"Levels\"), and \"Малина\" (\"Malina\", \"Raspberry\") by the group Class. However, it contained several original songs, including the hits \"Тучи\" (Tuchi, \"Clouds\"), \"Колечко\" (Kolechko, \"The Ring\"), \"Где-то\" (Gdye-to, \"Somewhere\"), and \"Она\" (Ona, \"She\"). \nA remixed version of the album followed one year later, Konyechno on remixed.  Alongside the remixed versions, the album contained the new hit \"Кукла\" (Kukla, \"Doll\") and a cover version of the Lubeh song \"Дуся\" (Dusya).\nIvanushki's second studio album, Твои письма (Tvoi pisma, Your Letters), released later in 1997, repeated the existing formula of original material and covers of past hits. \nLater that year, Igor Sorin left to pursue a solo career, and was replaced by Oleg Yakovlev, who had appeared in the music video for \"Doll\".\nOn September 1, 1998, Sorin committed suicide, jumping from the window of his high-rise apartment, and died three days later. The following year, the group released Фрагменты жизни (Fragmenti iz zhizni, Fragments of Life), their tribute to him, which contained songs he had written prior to joining Ivanushki, as well as poems he had written, and a song dedicated to him, \"Я тебя никогда не забуду\" (Ya tyebya nikogda nye zabudu, \"I Will Never Forget You\").\nIvanushki released their first full album with Yakovlev as vocalist, Об этом я буду кричать всю ночь (Ob etom ya budu krichat' vsyu noch, I'll Shout About This All Night ), in April 1999. It was followed in 2000 by Подожди меня... (Podoshdi menya, Wait for Me), after which the group released their first compilation album, Ivanushki.Best.Ru.\nAlthough not having any studio album since 2002, Ivanushki kept on releasing singles; The latest songs of the Ivanushki International band: Tuchi Kruche recorded together with Khabib (Clouds are Cooler, Тучи Круче) (2022), Dve Zvezdi (Two stars, Две звезды) (2022).\nFormer member Oleg Yakovlev died on July 1, 2017, probably due to bilateral pneumonia or AIDS-related disease.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nCompilation albums\n\nLive albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial site\nIvanushki International discography at Discogs"

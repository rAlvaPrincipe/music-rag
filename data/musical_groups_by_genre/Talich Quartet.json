They have performed at the Prague Spring International Music Festival and Casals Festival.  Specializing in works by Czech composers, they have premièred works by Viktor Kalabis, Luboš Fišer and Luboš Sluka. \nThe quartet played for the first time in Paris on March 6 1975, with such success that they were invited to the United States in June 1976. However their North American debut is said to have been made in 1987.\nThey made many records for Calliope and at least one with Collins Classics. Their first Calliope recordings, of Dvořák String Quartets Opp. 61 and 96, and of the Mozart Clarinet Quintet with Bohuslav Zahradník and String Quartet, K 156, won the Grand Prix du Disque de l'Académie Charles Cros for 1977.  Their intégrale (complete cycle) of Beethoven quartets was recorded between the late 1970s and the early 1980s. The Mozart recording, and the Beethoven String Quartets Opp. 127 and 135 (CAL 1640), both won Diapason d'or awards.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTalich Quartet website\nCalliope website\nTalich Quartet discography at Discogs"

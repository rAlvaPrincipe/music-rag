    "text": "Ugress is an electronica project from Bergen, Norway, the main project of electronic musician Gisle Martens Meyer (GMM). Meyer started his music career in the early 1990s making Scream Tracker and Fast Tracker modules under the alias Gnosis. Among Meyer's other projects are Nebular Spool, Shadow of the Beat and Ninja9000 as well as scoring soundtracks for moving pictures and several TV-shows.\nUgress has released multiple albums, singles, and EPs to date. Their first five albums: Resound, released in 2002, climbed to the second place on the official Norwegian chart board. A second album, Cinematronics, was released two years later. It reached the third place on the same list. A third Ugress album titled Unicorn was released on January 28, 2008. On June 15, 2009, Ugress released their fourth studio album, called Reminiscience. Collectronics, a compilation album including previously unreleased material, was released in July 2010.\nUgress is notable for providing free mp3-versions of many of its songs through its web page and the web pages of associated acts like Nebular Spool.\nThe Norwegian word ugress means \"weeds\" (not as in cannabis).\n\n\n== Style ==\nUgress uses a lot of sample snippets from various artists, movies (in particular horror and science fiction movies) and TV shows.

    "text": "Acid Android (stylized as ACID ANDROID and formerly as acid android) is the solo project of yukihiro, drummer of the Japanese rock band L'Arc-en-Ciel. While yukihiro provides the vocals and many of the instruments himself, he also utilizes many support and guest musicians both in the studio and in live performances. The project is signed to yukihiro's Tracks on Drugs record label. To date Acid Android has released four albums and two mini-albums. The band, in contrast to L'Arc-en-Ciel, uses a harder, faster sound, more stage-lighting and mechanics to further energize their concerts.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band made their debut with a self-titled album in 2002. The EP Faults features Toni Halliday on vocals and appeared in 2003. The album Purification was released in 2006 with other band members contributing to the songs. Two releases appeared in 2010, the album 13:Day:Dream and the seven-track mini album Code. For 2017's D'erlanger Tribute Album ~Stairway to Heaven~, Acid Android covered \"After Image\" featuring D'erlanger's own Kyo.

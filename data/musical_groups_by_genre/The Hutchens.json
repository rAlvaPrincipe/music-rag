They were signed to Atlantic Records and released their debut album, Knock, Knock, in 1995. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album three stars out of five, writing that it \"showcases their laid-back country-rock to a fine effect.\"\nIts lead single, the title track, peaked at number 56 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.

Almost all music was made by Brundtland, Berge and Barlindhaug. They have released the albums Instinctive Travels (1996) on Parlophone and Skyjuice (1997) on Drum Island Records. The group dissolved in 1997, and Berge and Brundtland started Röyksopp in 1998.\nCritics have said that the music has a \"unique, polar mood\"  and that the skill level of the productions \"makes it very nice to be Norwegian, and make you wish that Tromsø was your hometown\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\nInstinctive Travels (1996)\nSkyjuice (1997)\n\n\n== See also ==\nRöyksopp\nSvein Berge\nTorbjørn Brundtland\nDrum Island\nAedena Cycle\nGaute Barlindhaug\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlanïa at Last.fm\nAlanïa discography at Discogs\nroyksoppsvarer.com from Archived.org\n\n\n== References =="

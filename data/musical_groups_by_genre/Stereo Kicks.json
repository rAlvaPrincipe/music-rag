    "text": "Stereo Kicks were an English-Irish boy band who were formed and were the twelfth contestant eliminated on the eleventh series of The X Factor in 2014. Stereo Kicks consisted of; James Graham, Jake Sims, Chris Leonard, Charlie Jones, Casey Johnson, Barclay Beales, Reece Bibby, and Tom Mann. Their debut single \"Love Me So\" was released on 21 June 2015 and charted at number 31 on the UK Singles Chart. Just a month later, however, having been together under a year, they announced they were disbanding due to their failure to land a record deal.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2014: Formation and The X Factor ===\nAll eight members of Stereo Kicks originally auditioned as soloists for series 11 of The X Factor in front of judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Mel B, but were all rejected at the bootcamp stage. They were formed by the judges because they felt they were rejects that they could work with. The group first sang together at bootcamp within hours of being put together; they performed a cover of the Snow Patrol song \"Run\". They received a standing ovation from all four judges with Cowell saying that they were one of the best boybands they had ever had on the show. As a result, they got through straight to the judges' houses stage, mentored by Walsh. At that stage they sang Justin Timberlake's \"Mirrors\" and later got sent to the live shows. The fans suggested names through the ITV website; they received over 46,000 entries. Stereo Kicks' reception has been very favourable with Cowell saying they were \"one of the best [groups] ever [to feature on the show]\" and the public comparing them to be \"as good as One Direction\" and their performance of \"Run\" reached 1 million views on The X Factor's YouTube channel a week after its upload on 28 September. Initially called the \"New Boy Band\", they later held a poll on the website to determine a new name and \"Stereo Kicks\" was chosen.\nStereo Kicks performed Katy Perry's \"Roar\" in the first week of the live shows. They landed in the sing-off during week two with Chloe Jasmine, but were saved when Walsh, Mel B and Cowell opted to send Jasmine home. They were in the sing-off again in week 4 against Lola Saunders. With Walsh and Mel B opting to save them, the result went to deadlock and Saunders was eliminated as the contestant with fewest public votes. With the eliminations of Blonde Electra and Overload Generation in week 1 and Only The Young in week 7, Stereo Kicks became Walsh's last remaining act in the competition. In the quarter-final, they were in the bottom two with Lauren Platt. The result went to deadlock, and were eliminated.\n\n\n==== Performances during the show ====\n\n\n=== 2015: Debut single and split ===\nOn 20 April 2015, Stereo Kicks announced their debut single \"Love Me So\".

In 2010, they signed a recording contract with Chicago-based Bloodshot Records.\n\n\n== Formation and early history ==\nStarted in 2005, under the name Whitey Morgan and the Waycross Georgia Farmboys, the original members included Whitey Morgan (a.k.a. Eric Allen) on vocals and guitar; Jeremy Mackinder on bass; and Dylan Dunbar and Jack Schneider on guitar and drums respectively. After establishing themselves in the Midwest Honky Tonk scene, the band recorded a self-produced EP which includes early versions of \"Goodbye Dixie,\" \"Prove It All To You,\" and \"If It Ain't Broke.\" The band soon signed a deal with Detroit's own Small Stone Recordings and went back into the studio to record a cover version of Van Halen's \"Runnin' with the Devil\" for the label's compilation album, Sucking the 70's.\n\n\n== Honky Tonks and Cheap Motels ==\nIn 2007, the band changed its line-up to Whitey Morgan on Vocals and Guitar, Benny James Vermeylen on Guitar and vocals – formerly of 3 Speed and South Normal, Jeremy \"Leroy\" Biltz on Guitar, Jeremy Mackinder on bass, and Mike Popovich – formerly of The Holy Cows, 3 Speed, and The OffRamps, on drums and officially becomes Whitey Morgan and the 78's.

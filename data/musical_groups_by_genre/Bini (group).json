    "text": "Bini (stylized in all caps; formerly Star Hunt Academy Girls or SHA Girls) is a Filipino girl group formed in 2019 through ABS-CBN's Star Hunt Academy (SHA). The group is composed of eight members: Aiah, Colet, Maloi, Gwen, Stacey, Mikha, Jhoanna, and Sheena.\nBini debuted on June 11, 2021, with their single, \"Born to Win\", after three years of training under SHA. Before their debut, the group released a pre-debut single, \"Da Coconut Nut\", on November 20, 2020. The group has since then gained wide recognition and has been dubbed as the \"Nation's Girl Group\" due to its significant impact on the public and Philippine pop music. They became the first Filipino pop group with the most monthly listeners on Spotify, and the first to top Billboard's Philippine Songs chart. They are also the first to receive the Billboard Philippines Women in Music \"Rising Star\" Award.\nOn June 9, 2024, Bini entered the Top Artist Global Chart on Spotify at 193rd place, making them the first Filipino artists to achieve the record. The group also became the first Filipino act to top the Spotify Philippines' Daily Top Artists chart on June 14, surpassing Taylor Swift. \nIn July 2024, Bini became the first Filipino pop act to perform at the KCON music festival, showcasing their single \"Cherry on Top\" at the pre-show of KCON LA at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. In November 2024, they became the first Filipino act to win the \"Best Asia Act\" award at the MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe group's name was taken from the Tagalog word binibini, which means \"young lady\", a nod to the group's vision to \"embody the idea of a modern Filipina –  sweet, fierce, independent, and informed\".\n\n\n=== Fandom ===\nThe fans of Bini are known as \"Bloom(s)\", often stylized as BL∞M(S), with the infinity symbol replacing the Os. This styling is inspired by the group's tagline, Walo hanggang dulo (Eight until the end). The name \"Bloom\" reflects Bini's journey and symbolizes the \"beginning of springtime, that there is always beauty after every cold trial\". It was chosen from fan suggestions during a special announcement livestream on February 13, 2021.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2018–2020: Formation through Star Hunt Academy ===\nAs part of his belief that \"Filipino talent has a place on the global stage\", Laurenti Dyogi, ABS-CBN's Head of Entertainment Production, had the thought of forming a training camp where youth aspiring to become superstars \"can develop or further hone their talents.\" In 2018, ABS-CBN launched Star Hunt Academy (SHA), which had 250 auditionees between the ages of 16 and 19 years old from all over the Philippines. From this pool of auditionees, with recommendations from talent scouts, the first set of female SHA trainees was selected, composed of 12 girls. While Dyogi initially planned to debut a nine-member idol girl group, it was eventually trimmed down to eight girls: Aiah Arceta, Colet Vergara, Maloi Ricalde, Gwen Apuli, Stacey Sevilleja, Mikha Lim, Jhoanna Robles, and Sheena Catacutan. Of the eight members, two—Sheena and Gwen—were originally housemates from Pinoy Big Brother: Otso.\nThe group trained from 2019 to 2020 under local coaches, who include Kitchy Molina, the professional vocal coach and former chair of the Department of Voice, Music Theater, and Dance at the University of the Philippines College of Music; Austrian-born dance coach Mickey Perz; and South Korean coaches from MU Doctor Academy.\nOn August 3, 2019, the group debuted as SHA trainees during the online pre-show of PBB Otso Big Night. They performed at their first mall show in Taguig on August 15, 2019. Later in 2019, they appeared at a National Youth Commission event where they were named youth ambassadors. They also participated in the 2019 Manila Southeast Asian Games thanksgiving celebration.\nIn May 2020, Dyogi released a performance practice video of the group singing and dancing to \"Ngiti\" (Smile) by Young JV and Gary Valenciano on Twitter to show their progress in training. In August 2020, the group participated in the Philippine K-pop Convention's Happy Hallyu Day 4 event, performing K-pop dance covers, including Red Velvet's \"In & Out\", Blackpink's \"How You Like That\" and Twice's \"More & More\".\n\n\n=== 2020: Pre-debut activities, \"Da Coconut Nut\" ===\nFor Bini's pre-debut single, MU Doctor Academy and South Korean music production group Vo3e collaborated to transform national artist Ryan Cayabyab's novelty song \"Da Coconut Nut\" into an electropop remake. In addition, MU Doctor Academy collaborated with choreographers Moon Yeon-joo and Kwak Seong-chan, who formerly worked with K-pop groups, to create the choreography.\nOn November 6, 2020, the official lyric video for their remake of \"Da Coconut Nut\", premiered on the group's official YouTube channel. It was followed by the release of the official music video on November 20. On November 21, Bini performed \"Da Coconut Nut\" live for the first time on the noontime variety show It's Showtime, where it was well received by the audience.\nOn December 4, 2020, Bini signed a contract with Star Magic and Star Music.\n\n\n=== 2021–2022: Debut with \"Born to Win\" ===\nOn May 4, 2021, Bini released their first official debut teaser through a QR code leading to an image that reads \"Are you ready for the Biniverse?\" This was then followed by multiple teasers leading to their debut.

They are known for their high-energy performances, intricate choreography, and vibrant visuals, which are influenced by K-pop aesthetics yet retain a distinct Filipino flavor. Their music often features catchy melodies and meaningful lyrics, as shown in their songs \"Salamin, Salamin\" (Mirror, Mirror) and \"Pantropiko\" (Tropical). Their EP, Talaarawan, was also praised for its luscious harmonies and adlibs, as well as for its witty and distinct tongue-and-cheek lyricism.\nBini's pre-debut single \"Da Coconut Nut\" (2020), was a genre-bending P-pop song that infuses the classic Filipino novelty song of the same name with electronic music influences. The novelty song was given a new flavor and made upbeat, fun, and light in Bini's version. The song was met with positive reception, with some praising the group's cohesive visual presentation and synchronized choreography, and distinct approach to Filipino pop music. It has also been noted that the group's choice of songs and musical styles reflect a distinguishable Filipino identity.\nBini's 2022 song, \"Huwag Muna Tayong Umuwi\" (Let's Not Go Home Yet), gained recognition among listeners, particularly the LGBT community for being a love song whose lyrics transcend gender boundaries, and was incorporated into the soundtrack of the 2022 romantic comedy film An Inconvenient Love.\n\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n\nGianna Sibal of Mega magazine praised Bini for championing the Philippine music industry. She wrote that Bini provides \"a broader appreciation of Philippine music on global platforms\". Likewise, Angela Nicole Guiral of Tatler Asia identified Bini as one of the top P-Pop acts in terms of pushing the future of the Philippine music industry forward. In November 2024, the Los Angeles Clippers' Spirit Dance Team performed \"Cherry on Top\", in celebration of Filipino Heritage Night. The number took place at Intuit Dome in California. Five of the featured dancers are Filipino-American.\nSibal also credited Bini's Roadtrip Adventures vlog series for bolstering local tourism. The series was made in collaboration with the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). Bini has been recognized for promoting Filipino culture, even in their English-language songs such as \"Cherry on Top\". Christa Escudero of Rappler described Bini as \"a great representation of the Philippines to the world\". \nApart from boosting national pride, Bini has been noted to represent diverse ethnic identities among Gen Z Filipinos as well. The members of the group hail from different regions and cultural backgrounds. Some of their songs, such as \"B HU U R\" from their first album Born to Win, feature different Philippine languages, including Ilocano and Visayan languages. In Escudero's feature about the Cebu leg of the Biniverse tour, a 22-year-old concertgoer was quoted as saying, \"Bini is a victory for us Bisaya, and a victory for our country\".\nMarielle Filoteo of Parcinq described Bini as a feminist girl group. She wrote that they \"celebrate femininity in every concept\". Maria Sophia Rosello of Art+ echoed the sentiment a year later, following the release of Talaarawan. She noted that the mini-album was released on International Women's Day and said that each track \"celebrat[es] female strength, resilience, and individuality\". Hannah Mallorca of The Philippine Daily Inquirer noted that the group's increased influence has led to them being invited to events focusing on female empowerment and other social issues. In the interview, the members affirmed that they want to empower women through their music and other ventures. Colet told the publication, \"As a young woman in the industry, I feel empowered that we're considered to talk about important topics. It hit me with a realization that we have a responsibility as public figures and our voice matters.\"\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Endorsements ===\nSince their debut, Bini has been on several endorsement deals, reflecting their broad appeal and influence, especially among Gen Z consumers.

    "text": "The Coral Reefer Band is the touring and recording band of American singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett (until Buffett's death in September 2023). The band's name alludes to both coral reefs (in line with Buffett's tropical-themed music) and \"reefer\" (slang for marijuana).\nFingers Taylor, an original Coral Reefer, would discover Buffett performing solo one evening at The Hub on the University of Southern Mississippi campus in 1970. This resulted in Taylor contributing harmonica accompaniment for part of the performance, the beginning of their long-term collaboration.\nThe band performed their final concert with Buffett on May 6, 2023, in San Diego, about three and a half months before Buffett's death in September of that year. On October 30, 2023, Mac McAnally stated in an interview that the Coral Reefer Band would continue touring and performing Buffett's music at his request, reiterating statements made by bandmate Robert Greenidge in a separate interview on September 9, 2023.\nThe band reunited for the first time since Buffett's passing on April 11, 2024, and served as the house band for the ‘Keep the Party Going: A Tribute to Jimmy Buffett’ concert at the Hollywood Bowl. At the concert, McAnally introduced Scotty Emerick as a full-time member of the group.\nIn May 2024, the band played their first full show after Buffett's death (not counting the Hollywood Bowl tribute concert) at the New Orleans Jazz Fest, where they were joined by guest Sonny Landreth, who had also worked alongside Buffett and the band on various occasions before Buffett's death.\nIn June, the band announced they would be doing three shows in August as part of the \"Keep The Party Going\" tour, at the Wharf Amphitheater in Orange Beach, Alabama, on August 1st; the Cadence Bank Amphitheater at Chastain Park in Atlanta, Georgia on August 2nd; and the Riverbend Music Center in Cincinnati, Ohio on August 4th. Proceeds from these shows went to the Buffett-founded nonprofit charity \"Singing for a Change.\"  Will Kimbrough, one of Buffett's occasional collaborators and songwriting partners, joined the band at this time.  All three shows were sold-out or close to sellouts including over 15,000 people attending the Cincinnati show. The band indicated more dates would be added in the future.\n\n\n== Current line-up ==\nAs of 2024, the band's lineup consists of:\n\nDoyle Grisham – pedal steel guitar (1974–1976, 1981, 1998–present)\nMichael Utley – keyboards (1975–present)\nRobert Greenidge – steel drums (1983–present)\nPeter Mayer – harmony and backing vocals, lead guitar (1989–present)\nJim Mayer – harmony and backing vocals, bass (1989–present)\nRoger Guth – drums (1989–present)\nJohn Lovell – trumpet (1992–present)\nMac McAnally – lead vocals, harmony and backing vocals, rhythm and lead guitars, slide guitar, dobro (1994–present)\nTina Gullickson – harmony and backing vocals, acoustic rhythm guitar (1995–present)\nNadirah Shakoor – harmony and backing vocals, lead vocals (1995–present)\nEric Darken – percussion (2011–present)\nMick Utley - harmony and backing vocals, keyboards (2022–present)\nScotty Emerick - lead vocals, harmony and backing vocals, guitar (2023–present)\nWill Kimbrough – lead vocals, harmony and backing vocals, guitar (2024-present; occasional guest 2003-2023)\n\n\n== Former members ==\nFormer members of the Coral Reefer Band include:\n\nJimmy Buffett – Vocals, rhythm guitar, ukulele (1974–2023; died 2023)\nRoger Bartlett  – harmony vocals, Acoustic guitar, electric guitar.

    "text": "Rushnychok (Ukrainian: РУШНИЧОК) was a Ukrainian-Canadian four-person music ensemble from Lachine, Quebec, Canada actively performing from 1969 to 1980 and later for small audiences. Considered the best Ukrainian diaspora ensemble of the 1970s, the four male performers comprising the band were sometimes referred to as the Ukrainian Beatles, and were descendents of Ukrainian emigrants.  \n\n\n== Band Members ==\nAndrij Harasymowycz -- vocals and guitar\nEugene (Ewhen) Osidacz -- accordion\nGeorge (Yurko) Sztyk -- bass guitar\nStepan (Stefan) Andrusiak -- drums\n\n\n== Active Years ==\n\n\n=== Band Name ===\nThe term rushnychok in Ukrainian can refer to an embroidered cloth handkerchief wrapped around couples' hands during weddings.  It is also the title of an original song composed by Platon Maiboroda with lyrics by Andrij Malyshko, and can refer to an embroidered cloth more generally, in this case an embroidered cloth used as a sign of motherly love.  This song, Rushnychok, from which the band shares its name, is featured as the first song on their first released recording.  When the group began performing, they played dance and party music, including performances at weddings, and were sometimes referred to as a zabava band. They would later perform internationally, including performance at the Ukrainian National Association's estate, Soyuzivka, in the Catskill Mountains of New York.\n\n\n=== Style ===\nRushnychok's musical influences included The Beach Boys, The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones as well as Winnipeg's D-Drifter 5 and Montreal's Sheremeta Band. Their music blended traditional styles featuring the accordion with more contemporary styles featuring guitars and percussion.   Their decision to perform in full Ukrainian folk costume together with their band's name, was unusual in that most Ukrainian immigrants of the time were reluctant to openly display their national heritage. \nIn the words of band member Stepan Andrusiak, the group sought to blend \"traditional sentiments and contemporary life.\". They considered their music to be fun and entertaining.  Andrusiak also reflected in 2020 that, \"at the core of our repertoire stood songs of valiant fighters for Ukraine’s freedom.\"\n\n\n=== First performance and later collaborations ===\nThe band's first performance was at a new Montreal restaurant and reception hall called La Steppe, on New Year's Eve 1969.  Prior to the band's released recordings, Andrij Harasymowycz's older brother, Youra Harasymowycz, was the original accordion player, but left the band to study dentistry.  This opened a space for Eugene Osidacz to join the group, who was recruited by Stefan Andrusiak following a university broom ball game.  Friend of Stepan Andrusiak and band member, George (Yurko) Sztyk, along with Andrij Harasymowycz and Eugene (Ewhen) Osidacz contributed to original song compositions, collaborating with playwright and poet, Borys Budny.\n\n\n=== Albums and songs ===\nDuring the period they were active, they released five albums in 1973, 1974, 1976, 1977, and 1980 entitled Volume One, Volume Two, Volume Three, Volume Four, and Volume Five (Special 10th Anniversary Limited Edition). \nSome of their songs including “Земле моя” (My Homeland), “Гей степами” (Song Of The Steppes), “Пісня про Тютюнника” (The Ballad Of Yuri Tjutjunnyk), and “Рушничок я тобі вишиваю” (An Embroidery For You) were considered to be anti-Soviet in nature and therefore illegal in the Soviet Union during the time the group was active.  Because of this, their recordings were smuggled into Soviet Ukraine because they were considered illegal.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nRushnychok I\n1973, Sage Promotions, RCA, LP\n\nRushnychok\nMarichka\nYasyny\nWhen Trumpets Play\nTwo Colors\nChervona Ruta\nSusidko\nThe Solitary Steed\nRozpriahayty Hloptsi Kony\nMy Loved One\nCarpathian Nights\nLubimsia / Lets Get Together\nLearn Well, My Brothers\nRushnychok II\n1974, Sage Promotions, RCA, LP\n\nThe Whistling Kozaks\nChaban\nThe Moon In The Sky\nMoyi Yasyny\nEyes As Dark As The Soil\nThe Mosquito And The Fly\nLytsar\nI Can See The Village\nA Mist In The Valley\nThe Storm\nMy Homeland\nRushnychok III\n1976, Sage Promotions, RCA, LP\n\nCanada's Rushnychok\nWe Are Young\nYou\nAh!

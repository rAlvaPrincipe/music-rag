    "text": "Light Asylum is a Brooklyn-based electronic music project from Shannon Funchess.\nHer music is heavily influenced by 1980s music and incorporates elements of darkwave, synthpop and post-punk. The Guardian compared Light Asylum to Nine Inch Nails and Depeche Mode.\n\n\n== History ==\nFunchess founded Light Asylum in 2007 and asked Bruno Coviello to join as keyboard player after hearing him play guitar for a friend's project.\nThe band released their first EP In Tension in 2010. The four-track EP was re-released in 2011 through indie label Mexican Summer. Their self-titled d√©but album was released in May 2012. It received generally positive reviews from Pitchfork, Fact, Mixmag, NME, XLR8R and The Quietus.\nCoviello left the project in 2012 shortly after the debut LP was released to pursue other things.\nFunchess has provided vocals for acts such as TV on the Radio, !!! and Telepathe. Funchess also collaborated with The Knife on the track \"Stay Out Here\" from the band's fourth album Shaking the Habitual in 2013.\nLight Asylum's song \"Dark Allies\" was used as the theme song of the 2019 podcast The Ballad of Billy Balls.\nIn 2022, Light Asylum performed at the Cold Waves music festival in Chicago and played two new songs. Funchess promised \"new music soon.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nLight Asylum (2012)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nIn Tension (2010)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Shallow Tears\" (2012)\n\"Heart of Dust\" (2012)\n\"A Certain Person\" (2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLight Asylum discography at Discogs"

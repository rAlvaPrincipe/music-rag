Claudio played three cover songs, two Prize Fighter Inferno songs, and a new song he had written a few days before. Claudio gave information on the new song, titled \"The Echomaker,\" saying that it was a demo for a project he and his wife were working on, a musical called \"Rosie Barbara and the Family Massacre.\" The title of the song came from the book of the same name that Claudio's wife was reading at the time, which he felt fit with the subject of the story. The setlist of that night was as follows:\n1. \"Your Love\" (The Outfield cover)\n2. \"Purple Haze\" (Jimi Hendrix cover)\n3. \"Wayne Andrews, the old bee Keeper\" (PFI song)\n4. \"The Echomaker\" (new song)\n5. \"Who Watches the Watchmen?\" (PFI song)\n6. \"Faithfully\" (Journey cover)\nOn their 2011 Neverender: SSTB tour, Coheed and Cambria played \"Who Watches The Watchmen?\" as part of their acoustic set.\nThe first ever Prize Fighter Inferno tour was announced on July 18, 2023, with 11 dates starting February 17th, 2024.

It contains many of the same recurring themes as the Coheed and Cambria story, such as love, the importance of children, and death. The album is being told from the point of view of the character Jesse, also known as \"Inferno\" (also referred to in the “Second Stage Turbine Blade” Comics as “The Prise Fighter Inferno”).\nThe name of the album, My Brother's Blood Machine, is a phrase that appears in Coheed and Cambria's In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3. This story is set in the past of the universe from the Amory Wars. In an interview with rock-sound.net in 2005, Claudio Sanchez has said that the two stories \"do connect, but not in the most obvious way.\"\nLong-arm and Butchie Bleam brothers brought together by physical distortion and social seclusion are about to find themselves in the running for the most unusual job in the world.....DEATH! Listen to the story unfold as we follow these two misunderstood yet maniacal minstrels of macabre in a neverending race for ultimate power. Listen to the disturbing details as the songs takes you through the hell that is the Blood Machine. This is a story being told in song......this is hell being unleashed through love and sound...... I am the hitchhiker doomed to tell the tale of Margretville, I am your Guide, I am the Prise Fighter Inferno.\nIn an interview posted by MTV News on September 29, 2006, Claudio went into much greater detail about the plot:\n\"Well, this story actually acts as a prequel to the Amory Wars,\" the center of the Coheed and Cambria mythology, Sanchez explains. The Inferno character, who appears in the Coheed concept as a man named Jesse, \"dies in the Good Apollo: Volume One, and is resurrected on present-day Earth. So he leaves the solar system that the story takes place in, and gets resurrected in the present day. But before he can tell the story of the Amory Wars, he needs to tell the story of the Blood Machine.\n\"The Blood Machine revolves around three families, one being the Bleam family, who are our horrific sort of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' family,\" he continued. \"There's the McCloud family — where we have our main character, Cecilia — and the Early family. And [Cecilia's] love interest is the son of that family, Johnny. And there are so many subplots. One, for example, talks about how Cecilia's father happens to molest her, and eventually she can't take it anymore and tries to convince Johnny to leave with her. She steals her two brothers, who happen to be twins, and Johnny decides not to go. So she ends up running away with the twins into the woods, where she meets the Bleam family.\"\nSanchez said that there are two Bleam brothers — Long-Arm and Butchie — who are horrific monsters. \"Their mother happens to be crazy, and she ends up telling these two kids that 'God has come to me with a higher calling for you — you need to be the new Death,' and she tells them that they have to go out and collect souls for God,\" he explained. \"And so, out of their mind, they're like, 'OK, so when a body dies, how do we get the soul out of it?' They construct this Blood Machine, which basically tears a body to shreds, and they think that releases the soul.\"\nSanchez said there are numerous subplots that will unfold as well, including the elaborate background of the Bleam kith: The family's patriarch, a meth addict, dismembers his wife when he catches her pinching from his stash, and her death sends the Bleam boys on a downward spiral toward complete madness.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial MySpace page\nEqual Vision Records"

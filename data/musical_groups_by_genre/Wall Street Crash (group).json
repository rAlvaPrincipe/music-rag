Performing music from the 1920s to the 1980s, they appeared regularly on British television and in three Royal Variety Performances.\n\n\n== History ==\nKeith Strachan had been the musical director of the TV production of Oh Boy, and formed the group in early 1980 from members of the cast. Peter Olsen joined six weeks later. The group made their live debut in March 1980 at the Country Cousin in King's Road, London. They were spotted by Gerry Maxim of MAM at a trade show, and he arranged for them to make their television debut on Saturday Night at the Mill.\nIn April 1981 the group had their own television show on BBC2, and in June 1981, a television special, The Music of Wall Street Crash, was broadcast on BBC1. The group's debut self-titled album was released in 1982. European Affair followed in 1983, which included original material. Their version of the song \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\" reached number 8 in Italy in 1983.

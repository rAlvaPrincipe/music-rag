    "text": "The Emotions are an American soul/R&B vocal group from Chicago. The group started out in gospel music but transitioned into R&B and disco music. The Emotions were named by VH1 as one of the 18 most influential girl groups of all time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nThe group was originally a gospel outfit known as the Hutchinson Sunbeams who toured the gospel circuit with their father Joe Hutchinson. The Sunbeams sang on Jerry Van Dyke’s “Children’s Gospel” television show and also occasionally performed in the concert with Mahalia Jackson. They eventually became an R&B/Soul act with a popular following in their hometown of Chicago, Illinois. Soon being renamed as The Emotions, they signed with the Memphis-based Volt imprint of Stax Records in the late 1960s. Under the production of Isaac Hayes and David Porter the group issued their 1969 debut album entitled So I Can Love You on Stax.\n\"So I Can Love You\" rose to no. 43 upon the Billboard Top R&B Albums chart. The album's title track got to No. 3 on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart and No. 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Another single entitled \"The Best Part Of A Love Affair\" rose to no. 27 upon the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart.\nDuring 1970, The Emotions released a single entitled \"Heart Association.\" That song reached No. 29 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. The girl group went on to release their sophomore LP entitled Untouched in 1972 upon Stax. A song from the album called \"Show Me How\" rose to No. 13 upon the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart.\nDuring 1972, the girl group also released another single called \"My Honey and Me.\" That song reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart.\nThe Emotions then started to work on their third studio album entitled Songs of Innocence and Experience. This LP was due to be issued in 1973, but was eventually shelved. The girl group went on to appear in the 1973 feature film Wattstax, performing the song \"Peace Be Still.\" The tune went on to be added to the movie's soundtrack. Wattstax was also nominated for a Golden Globe in the category of Best Documentary. With Stax becoming defunct in 1975, the group then left the record label altogether.\n\n\n=== Above and beyond ===\nThe group then joined up with Columbia Records where an association with Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire brought them their greatest level of success. With White and Charles Stepney on production, The Emotions issued in 1976 their third studio album Flowers on Columbia Records. Flowers rose to No. 5 upon the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 45 on the Billboard 200. The album was also certified Gold in the US by the RIAA. The LP's title track got to No. 16 on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart. Another single called \"I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love\" rose to No. 4 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart and No. 13 on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart.\nFollowing Charles Stepney's death in 1976, White took over producing the Emotions. During June 1977 the group issued their follow up album entitled Rejoice. The album reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top R&B Albums chart and No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart. Rejoice has also been certified Platinum in the US by the RIAA.\nWith the LP came the single “Don't Ask My Neighbors\" which got to the top ten on the Billboard R&B singles charts. Another song called \"Best of My Love\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Pop and R&B charts and won a Grammy for Best R&B Performance By a Duo or Group with Vocals, as well as an American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Single. \"Best of My Love\" has also been certified Platinum in the US by the RIAA.\nA compilation album entitled Sunshine was, in November 1977, released by Stax. Sunshine got to No. 39 on the US Billboard Top Soul Albums chart. Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone found the album \"is harder edged, more classically soulful than (Rejoice).\" John Shearlaw of Record Mirror exclaimed \"Old Emotions, new Emotions-they're just as good.\" Covers of Bill Withers' \"Ain't No Sunshine\" and Carla Thomas' \"Gee Whiz (Look at His Eyes)\" appeared on the album. Whilst the album cut \"Shouting Out Love\" peaked at No. 31 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart.\nDuring April 1978, the Emotions issued Sunbeam, their third studio album on Columbia. The album rose to No. 12 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 40 on the Billboard 200 chart. John Storm Roberts of High Fidelity stated \"\"Sunbeam\" sparkles with good tracks.\" Glenn Clark of The Morning Call wrote \"The best thing I can say about this LP is that I like it. The Emotions' brand of snappy and upbeat soul is good for my soul. Maurice White, guru of Earth, Wind & Fire, produced this album, and I think he has blended well the talent he has brought together.\" At this time, Wanda began dating Brothers Johnson keyboardist Wayne Vaughn, and the two composed \"Come into My World\" together. They were married in 1980 or '81, and continued to write songs as a team.\nSunbeam has been certified Gold in the US by the RIAA.

Jon Wall of Melody Maker wrote \"throughout Come into Our World The Emotions' superb vocal control, range and harmonic sense are displayed to maximum effect\". Wall also added \"Come into Our World is one of the most appealing albums I've heard since Off the Wall. I can't get the album off the turntable and I don't want to\". Bill Rhedon of The Baltimore Sun noted that the album has \"excellent material\" with \"simply steady, unvarying Coming at You, Soul.\" A song called \"What's the Name of Your Love?\" also got to no. 30 upon the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart.

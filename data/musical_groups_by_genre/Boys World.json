Each member was sent a direct message on Instagram about the opportunity to be in a girl group. Villaluz, the first member to be contacted, took over a month to respond to the message as she had doubts over the genuineness of the message. Kay added that it was also \"hard to believe\" and that they had a lot of conversations with KYN, but once it had come into motion, it felt right for her. Sonny Takhar, the founder of KYN, stated that as the group was formed, the existing members were in charge of who else was added to the lineup. After Villaluz followed Simpson, Kay, Caceres and Ruby; the group was formed on April 26, 2019. Boys World was revealed to the public when they posted on their TikTok account in January 2020, after the group got a house in Los Angeles together.

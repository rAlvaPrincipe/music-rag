    "text": "Oh Hiroshima are a post-rock band originally from Kristinehamn, Sweden formed around 2007 by Leif Eliasson and Jakob Hemström, who were later joined by Simon Axelsson and Hemström's younger brother Oskar Nilsson. The band is noted for its subdued electronic instrumentation, abstract guitar texturing, and use of vocal soundscapes.\nBeginning as an experimental music project between Eliasson and Hemström, Nilsson officially joined the group as their drummer in 2011 during the writing process for debut album Resistance Is Futile, having before recorded bass with the group. Axelsson joined the band that same year as their bass player.\nThe first releases by Oh Hiroshima were the demo EPs Empty Places Full of Memories and Tomorrow, released in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Their first album, Resistance Is Futile, was self-released digitally in 2011. Their second album, In Silence We Yearn, was self-released digitally in November 2015, and on 1 July 2016, Fluttery Records re-issued the album on CD. A vinyl version followed on 2 December later that year through Napalm Records. In 2018, the band's debut LP was re-issued physically as well—on CD by Fluttery Records on 22 February, and on vinyl by Napalm Records on 7 December.\nFounding guitarist Leif Eliasson departed from the band in July 2018. In October 2018, they announced that they had signed a deal with Napalm Records for their third album and on 26 July 2019, Oscillation was released. In January 2021, bassist Simon Axelsson announced he was leaving the band, but would join them on stage \"whenever possible\".\nOnce again a duo, the group released their new album Myriad on 4 March 2022 via Napalm Records. They also released a music video for the first single Humane.\nTheir 2024 album All Things Shining was released on Pelagic Records catalogue Pel262\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nJakob Hemström – guitars and vocals\nOskar Nilsson – drums\n\n\n=== Former ===\nLeif Eliasson – guitars, drums (early) (2011–2018)\nSimon Axelsson – bass guitar (2011–2022)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nResistance Is Futile (2011)\nIn Silence We Yearn (2015)\nOscillation (2019)\nMyriad (2022)\nAll Things Shining (2024)\nEPs\n\nEmpty Places Full of Memories (2009)\nTomorrow (2010)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOh Hiroshima on Bandcamp\nOh Hiroshima on X"

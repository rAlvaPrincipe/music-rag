    "text": "Foreign Beggars were an English hip hop and dubstep group. Since their formation in 2002, the group's trajectory had seen them evolve from an underground hip hop group to an electronic crossover act. The group consisted of four artists individually known as Orifice Vulgatron (Pavan Mukhi, vocals), Metropolis Graham (Ebow Enyan Graham, vocals), DJ Nonames (James Miller, turntables), and Dag Nabbit (Dag Torgersbraten, producer). Vulgatron and Metropolis combined with Noisia to make the side project and supergroup \"I Am Legion\". They released their collaborative album I Am Legion on 2 September 2013.\nForeign Beggars made their start producing several singles and albums on their own Dented Records imprint. In 2011 they teamed up with the Never Say Die label on The Harder They Fall EP. Following a diverse series of singles for mau5trap released in 2012, the group released its new album The Uprising on the deadmau5-helmed label. In celebration of the release of the album, Foreign Beggars went on UK and North American tours to showcase their new material in the live arena.\nOn 9 May 2019, the group announced via Facebook they were to disband after 17 years together, with Mukhi announcing a new solo project, PAV4N, around the same date.\nOn 18 April 2020, Foreign Beggars member Ebow Enyan 'Metropolis' Graham 'suffered an accident at home and died in the early hours of the morning'.\nOn 29 January 2021, the group's remaining members collaborated with Delhi-based hip hop duo Seedhe Maut and producer Sez on the Beat to release the song 'No Enema'.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOrifice Vulgatron and Dag Nabbit met in Dubai playing in metal, grunge and indie bands as early as 1993.

Dag Nabbit moved to Norway in 1998, Orifice Vulgatron to London in 1999, both continued to produce, promote and perform.\nDJ Nonames also met Metropolis at university in 2000. They soon joined hip hop and funk band Focused Few and began throwing warehouse parties and touring. Orifice Vulgatron was introduced to Nonames through DJ Gizroc, then part of the Mixologists Crew, whilst working on sound and lighting for \"The Wizard of Oz\", where Nonames was doing the entire sound with a Technics 1210, a vestax 05 and a \"Wizard of Oz\" vinyl.

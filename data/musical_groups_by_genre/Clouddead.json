    "text": "Clouddead (styled as cLOUDDEAD) was an American experimental hip hop group, consisting of Doseone (Adam Drucker), Why? (Yoni Wolf) and Odd Nosdam (David Madson).\nThe group's name came from a nonsensical knock-knock joke Drucker's sister told him when she was five years old.\n\n\n== Style ==\nClouddead's sound is notoriously hard to define, and although it is undoubtedly grounded in \"traditional\" hip-hop, influences as varied as ambient, electronica, psychedelic music, and indie rock can be heard.\n\n\n== History ==\nClouddead's first six 10-inch singles were compiled as a self-titled album, Clouddead, in 2001.\nPrinted on the sleeve of the single \"Dead Dogs Two\" is \"this is cLOUDDEAD number 9 of ten,\" indicating that as of Ten (2004), Clouddead have finished making music as a group.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\ncLOUDDEAD (2001)\nTen (2004)\nEPs\n\nThe Peel Session (2001)\nSingles\n\n\"apt.

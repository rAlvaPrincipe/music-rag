    "text": "Liricas Analas is a rap crew from the canton of Grisons, G R . Switzerland. Their first album, Analogia, is the first rap album in the Romansh language. Author and anthropologist Pascal Hofmeier notes that in choosing to rap in Romansh, a language spoken by only a few thousand people, yet instantly identifiable as Swiss, Liricas Analas takes the concept of Lokalpatriotismus (local pride), which is so prevalent in the Swiss hip-hop scene, to an extreme level. Their 2006 CD, AnalFaBad, contained the chart-topping song \"Siemis\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nPius aka pddp\nJust\nFlepp\nOrange aka Pumaranza\nSpoon\nDJ Gionson\nDJ Suit\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAnalogia (2004)\nAnalFaBad (2006)\nAnalectrica (2009)\nAnalium (2012)\nBanalitad (2016)\nLIRICAS ANALAS (2022)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLiricas Analas homepage"

    "text": "DVAS (Dietzche V. & the Abominable Snowman) was a Canadian electronic dance music group formed in 2003 in Edmonton by Canadian musicians Jered Stuffco and Darren Veres.\nThe group played their final live show on July 17, 2011. \n\n\n=== Macho ===\nMacho documents the group from its very beginnings with a number of its singles and some new and some not widely available tracks.\nMichael Douglas was the muse for Black Rain, one of 10 tracks on their latest collection, Macho. (Douglas also starred in a 1991 crime film of the same name.) \"The movie's great and Michael Douglas is an icon,\" smiles Darren Veres.  It's obviously a huge joke,\" adds Jered Stuffco.\nRecorded and mixed in Edmonton via computerâ€”the disc required patience, humor and, above all, high-speed internet connections and trust. Some songs required two weeks of edits and dozens of e-mails between band mates.\n\n\n=== Mixtapes and Remixes ===\nDVAS have released three Internet-only mixtapes, a slew of remixes, and the track \"Inner Sanctum\" featured on the 2009 France based blog turned label, Valerie: \"Valerie And Friends\" Compilation.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDVAS MACHO (2007, Pop Echo Records: CAN)\nSociety (2010, Upper Class Recordings: CAN)\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\n\n== External links ==\nDVAS Musique\nDVAS Myspace\nUpper Class Recordings"

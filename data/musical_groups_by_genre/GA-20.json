They primarily play Chicago Blues.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMatthew Stubbs formed GA-20 in early 2018 during a hiatus from playing guitar with Charlie Musselwhite, due to Musselwhite touring with Ben Harper. Stubbs sought to put a new project together to do blues gigs aside from his Psych-Rock group The Antiguas. Stubbs met vocalist Pat Faherty through his many local Boston gigs. Faherty was a regular at these gigs and even took guitar lessons from Stubbs. Early performances by the band had a rotating group of musicians with Faherty and Stubbs as the core members. Some early performances used different drummers and various other musicians including Matt Prozialeck on harmonica, sometimes playing as a four-piece band. They adopted the name GA-20 in early 2018. The group became a trio by 2018 consisting of two guitars and drums. About a year after their formation, they scored a deal with Karma Chief Records. The group has been described as a trio that plays stripped down 1950s/1960s-style Chicago blues with a lot of distortion and no bass.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter signing with Karma Chief Records in December 2018, the band released the single \"Naggin' On My Mind\"  which featured Charlie Musselwhite and Luther Dickinson.

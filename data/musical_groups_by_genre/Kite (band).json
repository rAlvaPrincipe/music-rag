    "text": "Kite are a Swedish synth-pop group composed of Nicklas Stenemo (The Mo, Melody Club) and Christian Berg (Yvonne, Strip Music, The April Tears). Originating from Malmö and now based in Stockholm, they are signed to Astronaut Recordings and have published six EPs since their debut in 2008, each of which was released on CD and as a limited vinyl record edition. They have performed at festivals including Recession Festival in Århus, Denmark, Arvika Festival and Putte i parken in Sweden, Wave Gotik Treffen in Leipzig, and Amphi Festival in Cologne.\nIn 2020 they released new music with producer Benjamin John Powers.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nTheir eponymous debut EP Kite was reviewed favorably by the Side-Line magazine comparing it to classic 1980s synth-pop acts such as Erasure or Yazoo, while the German Sonic Seducer noted singer Stenemo's distinctive voice.  The EP Kite III was lauded for its original sound by Side-Line and Sonic Seducer, the latter marking a darker tone in this release. The release Kite IV has been seen as a mix of classic 1980s synth-pop similar to OMD and modern, experimental sounds. Kite's sixth EP VI was released in 2015. It has been compared to the sound of Kraftwerk and Vangelis.\nThe 2010 single \"Jonny Boy\" reached position 49 in the Swedish charts.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Album ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Appearances ===\nSweat Boys \"Endlessly\" feat.

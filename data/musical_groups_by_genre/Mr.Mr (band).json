She had revealed that the idol in question had joined an already existing idol group back in November, which led to widespread speculations about his possible identity. One of these guesses included Mr.Mr's Hon, which led the group's agency Winning Insight to release their official stance on February 17.  The agency wrote:\n\"Transgender A's writing has nothing to do with Mr.Mr's Hon. These claims are groundless.  After checking for confirmation, we found out that A and Mr.Mr's Hon were friends that counseled each other about their concerns even before A became a transgender. There was a time they helped each other out financially, but they are not more than friends.\nContrary to A's assertions, the claims they were more than friends, they were living together, she introduced him to a host bar for work, and she filmed their sexual intercourse are all false.  Resulting from the controversial writing, Hon is having a hard time because of the shock and hurt he received from a friend whom he had trusted.  They are preparing to sue A for defamation.\"\nHon will now be leaving the group, as stated in his letter due to the controversy.\nIt was revealed that the transgender woman has lied about the controversy, 'A' issued her official apology regarding all of this.  She said in an exclusive interview with Sports Korea on February 18, \"The words I wrote are all untrue.  Firstly, in relation to causing this, I am sorry towards Hon and the people around him.  I did not know that the words I wrote when I was feeling down and in a drunken state would become such a huge problem as this.  There are definitely no such things as videos.\"\nIt turned out that she and Hon had been friends even before she had undergone surgery. However, while Hon was preparing to debut as a singer, he had stopped contacting her, which made her sad and resulted in her writing these untrue claims after having a few drinks.\nShe said, \"I was frustrated that Hon did not contact me and grew more distant after becoming a singer.  Since we communicated so well, we were friends who would give each other a lot of advice about our problems and lean on each other.  I think that is why I was even sadder after Hon debuted as a singer.  The content in my writing was based on an acquaintance's situation; I only wrote it as if it were my personal situation because I had drunk alcohol.\"\nLastly, A said, \"After this incident happened, I had a phone conversation with Hon.  I was grateful that Hon did not hold me responsible nor did he rebuke me, which made me feel even more apologetic.  No matter the circumstances, I acknowledge that I caused this huge situation and made a mistake.  In addition, I am greatly reflecting on this so I hope I will not be sued. Hon told me he was talking with his agency, but I hope with all my heart for favourable arrangements.\"\nDue to this Hon left the group after this controversy, he wrote \"I'm sorry because I think I worried and disappointed a lot of people. A, who wrote the controversial post, and I were friends since a long time ago. But I wanted to say for certain that things in the post such as that I worked at a host bar, had financial troubles, had a video, and dated A are not true.\"\nHe added, \"After A wrote the post drunk, she checked it again a few hours later and said that she thought she made a mistake. Since she wrote it in a personal space, I didn't think there would be any problems. I told her not to think about it, and hung up. I don't want to sue an old friend. If the writings are true, I'd be embarrassed, but I didn't live my life like that. But it's true that MR.MR's image was hurt by this. So I decided to leave MR.MR.\"\nThe label reported saying \"Our label and the MR.MR members have decided to follow Hon's decision. We will not stop our support and encouragement so Hon can start anew. We're sincerely sorry for worrying our fans, and please support Hon and MR.MR members after this difficult decision.\"\n\n\n=== Dissing SM Entertainment ===\nWhen Mr.Mr. came back with the self-titled single, it also bore the same name as Girls' Generation's comeback EP Mr.Mr. which was released four days before. This raised suspicions by fans whether or not the boy group were mocking the girl group. Regarding this connection to Girls' Generation, a rep of Mr.Mr told that Asia Economy that the rumours were true. Mr.Mr's new single included lyrics such as: \"How could you do that when I'm right here? / Girl, you come out so easily from behind the curtain / Not me, but another mistake, Mr.Mr / I bet you're amused by my embarrassment,\" and, \"I become faint for a main like you / Am I loser and are you a winner? / We're going the same path / I must have looked small from your high perch / Is that why you did that to me?\"\nThe group's agency WinningIn Sight CEO, released an official position on the group's diss song towards Girls' Generation's title track name on March 5. They mentioned the controversial diss's rumours were true. They also mentioned that the diss was directed towards Girls' Generation's company SM Entertainment.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nDoyeon (도연)\nChangjae (창재)\nTey (태이)\nSanghyun (상현)\nJaemin (재민)\nJin (진)\nJiwon (지원)\nHon (혼)\nRyu (류)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMR.MR Official Website"

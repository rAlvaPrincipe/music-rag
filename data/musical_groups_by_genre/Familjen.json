    "text": "Johan Tommy Karlsson (born April 10, 1976 in Hässleholm) is a Swedish techno/electropop artist who uses the alias Familjen (Swedish: [faˈmɪ̌lːjɛn], \"The Family\").\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKarlsson grew up in Hässleholm, Skåne (the same town as fellow electronica producers Andreas Tilliander and Stefan Thor (Folie)), but is currently based in Malmö. In his youth as a synthpop fan he also formed bands with Sophie Rimheden from nearby Bjärnum and joined the industrial act Morticians with Stefan Thor and Andreas Rimheden. Karlsson has previously produced Swedish indie band David & the Citizens.\nKarlsson describes his music as indie-techno:\n\"I'm pretty fed up with guitar - Indie and techno can get a bit monotone after a while.\"\nAll his lyrics are in Swedish, or the southern dialect of Scanian to be more precise. He performs live with Andreas Tilliander on synthesizer.\nBoth the album and the single Det snurrar i min skalle are released on Tellé in Norway, the same label as Röyksopp, Annie and Kings Of Convenience. Creative Vibes Recordings released the album in Australia in 2008.\nIn October 2007 Familjen won the Swedish web-based music competition Rampmusic (competitions were also held in Norway and Denmark). Some unexpected help came from the file sharing community The Pirate Bay, who on their website encouraged their visitors to vote for him (without Karlsson's knowledge).\nBoth music videos directed by Karlsson feature a previously shown image overlaid with a hand-drawn heart for the last few seconds.\nIn 2015 he produced the ...Baby One More Time-single by the Swedish singer Tove Styrke, a cover of Britney Spears's hit song released in 1998.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2007: Det snurrar i min skalle\n2008: Huvudet i sanden\n2010: Mänskligheten\n2012: Allt På Rött\n2018: Kom\n\n\n=== EP ===\n2006: Familjen EP on Adrian Recordings\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2006: \"Första/Sista\" on Adrian Recordings\n2006: \"Hög luft\" on Adrian Recordings / Hybris\n2007: \"Kom säger dom\" on Adrian Recordings / Hybris\n2007: \"Det snurrar i min skalle\" on Adrian Recordings / Hybris / A:Larm (Denmark) / Tellé (Norway) / Creative Vibes (Australia)\n2007: \"Huvudet i sanden\" on Adrian Recordings / Hybris / Tellé\n2010: \"När planeterna stannat\" on Adrian Recordings / Hybris\nOthers\n2014: Göra slut med gud (from Så mycket bättre - Season 5 - Ola Salo Day)\n2014: Regn hos mig (from Så mycket bättre - Season 5 - Orup Day)\n\n\n=== Videos ===\n2007: \"Det snurrar i min skalle\" (English translation: \"My mind is spinning\") Directed by Johan Söderberg.

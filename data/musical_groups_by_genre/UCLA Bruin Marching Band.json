    "text": "The Solid Gold Sound of the UCLA Bruin Marching Band represents the university at major athletic and extracurricular events. During the fall marching season, this 250-member band performs at the Rose Bowl for UCLA Bruin home football games. Pregame shows by the band aim to build crowd energy and enthusiasm with traditional UCLA songs like \"Strike Up the Band for UCLA\", \"Bruin Warriors\", and \"The Mighty Bruins\". Throughout the game, the band performs custom-arranged rock and pop songs, as well as the traditional fight songs and cheers of the university. The UCLA Varsity Band appears at basketball games and other athletic contests in Pauley Pavilion. In 2018, the Bruin Marching Band was featured on the Muse album \"Simulation Theory\" performing the Super Deluxe version of the song \"Pressure.\"\nThe UCLA band program, which includes the Marching and Varsity Bands, the Wind Ensemble and the Symphonic Band, is in the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music. Band appearances at athletic events are funded primarily by student registration fees, a direct allocation from the Chancellor's Office and donations to the Solid Gold Sound Club.\nIn 1993, the UCLA Bruin Marching Band was awarded the Sudler Trophy, an award bestowed on one university marching band every year. Described by a Los Angeles Times reporter as \"[t]he Heisman Trophy of the collegiate band world\", the award does not represent the winner of any championship, but rather a band surrounded by great music and tradition that has become respected nationally.\nAll marching members and teaching assistants in the Bruin Marching Band are full-time UCLA students.\n\n\n== Style ==\n\nThe UCLA Marching Band marches in a style with low mark times and glide steps. Field formations include fast moving precision drill progressions, letter blocks, pictures, concert arcs, and the famous Cursive UCLA formation. The band performs many different styles of shows, depending upon the occasion.\nThe exception to the drum corps marching style is the traditional pregame \"run-on\" where the band rapidly high-steps onto the field into the block letter U-C-L-A formation.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1925, at the Vermont Avenue campus, the UCLA Marching Band originated as a 50-piece ROTC unit under the direction of W. G. Powell. The band was part of the welcoming group when John Philip Sousa visited Los Angeles in 1928, and were directed by Sousa in the performance of \"Stars and Stripes Forever\". At that time, the director was Ben Laietsky, a member of Sousa's band. The band remained a military group until 1934. In 1935, under the direction of Leroy Allen, the group became an integral part of campus life, providing music at rallies and games. The original uniforms were military style, with military caps and waist-length capes.\nUnder directors C. B. Hunt and Patton McNaughton, the band increased in size to 128 members by 1947.\n\n\n=== Clarence Sawhill and Kelly James 1952-1982 ===\nIn 1952, Clarence Sawhill became director of bands. F. (Freeman) Kelly James became the director of the marching band, a position he would hold until suffering a stroke at the UCLA-Cal football game in 1980. Sawhill and James grew the UCLA band program to include a 100-piece Concert Band, an 80-piece Symphonic Wind Ensemble, a 144-piece Marching Band, and a 60-piece Varsity Band.\nIn the 1950s the UCLA Marching Band uniforms were gold/yellow jackets with navy blue pants, blue shakos and white shoes. The band marched in a military style. The band appeared in color on the cover of the November 26, 1956 issue of Sports Illustrated. It is one of the few so honored beginning with the University of Oklahoma marching band (1954), the Princeton University Band (1955), and later, The Ohio State University Marching Band (1958). This marks the first appearance by any UCLA organization on the cover of the magazine.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s the band emulated the Queen's Guard. The band had a similar marching style, including the distinctive arm swinging, but also having the high \"chair\" step. The uniform pants were school colors blue and black trim, and imitation bearskin (or tall busby) hats. In the early 1960s, the uniform coats were gold. later the uniform coats were dark blue. The shoes were black with white spats.\nIn 1961, the band made a European Tour which included performances in Denmark, France, Austria, Germany, England and Switzerland.\nIn 1972, women were admitted to the UCLA Band, as well as other college marching bands around the country as a response to the Title IX educational amendment. Many marching bands, including the UCLA Band, had women members or a women's auxiliary unit during World War II, but the bands gradually became all-male organizations after the war.\nIn 1973, the band wore gold jackets, navy blue pants, navy blue turtleneck sweaters, and no hat, for one game. They were never used after that.\nIn 1977, the school purchased new uniforms that were royal blue with yellow trim. The large overcoats had a white front with block vertical UCLA letters. There were tall white plush busby hats with blue and yellow plumes.\n\n\n=== Thomas Lee and Gordon Henderson ===\nIn 1982, Gordon Henderson was appointed Director of the Marching and Varsity Bands. \nIn 1985, the band ordered newly designed uniforms, in the current military style. These uniforms were designed with band member input to replace the brightly colored 1977 uniforms. The uniforms consisted of navy blue wool trousers and coat with gold trim and white, knee-length, gold capes on the left shoulder. The shoes were changed to white. White gloves were standard as well. The large bearskin hats were replaced by Shako hats with white 12\" feather plumes. An all-powder blue uniform was prototyped, but rejected in favor of the navy blue. The color guard did wear powder blue uniform coats and skirts similar in style to the new uniforms for two years.\nIn 2007 the band was outfitted with new uniforms at the USC game. The coats were the then official \"True Blue\" color adopted by UCLA in 2004. Other elements from the 1985 uniforms were retained.\nIn 1985, Thomas Lee came from the University of Texas to be the Director of Bands and Director of the Wind Ensemble.\nThe UCLA Bruin Marching Band was the 1993 recipient of the Sudler Trophy, presented by the John Philip Sousa Foundation in recognition of the Band's tradition of excellence and innovation.\nThe band became part of the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music in 2007 when the departments of Music, Ethnomusicology and Musicology were combined. Musician and recording executive Herb Alpert gave $30 million to UCLA in November 2007, the single largest individual gift to music higher education in the western United States.\nLee retired from UCLA in 2012, and Dr. Travis Cross was appointed the new Wind Ensemble conductor in 2013.\nHenderson retired in 2020 as Director of Bands after 38 years of service to UCLA.\n\n\n=== Ken Fisher ===\nKen Fisher was appointed the new Marching Band Director in 2023.\n\n\n== Traditions ==\nFor the football pregame show, the UCLA Marching Band traditionally opens with the Bruin Fanfare, an adaptation of the 20th Century Fox Fanfare. Then follows Strike Up The Band for UCLA, a gift from George and Ira Gershwin to UCLA. It was adapted from their showtune \"Strike Up the Band\", and was presented to UCLA at an All-University Sing held in Royce Hall during Fall 1936. The Star Spangled Banner is played by the band in concert formation. Then the band moves into the script UCLA formation to the tune of Bruin Warriors. The band marches off the field to The Mighty Bruins, composed in 1984 by Academy Award-winning composer Bill Conti to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the UCLA Alumni Association.\nFollowing all athletic contests, the band plays the UCLA Alma Mater \"Hail to the Hills of Westwood\". After victories, this is followed by \"Rover\".\n\n\n== Away game appearances ==\nThe entire UCLA Bruin Marching Band travels to the San Francisco Bay area each fall for either the Stanford or Cal game. This tradition began in 1931, when the band traveled to the Stanford game by ship from Los Angeles.

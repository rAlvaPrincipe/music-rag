It was active between 2009 and 2016.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOrties, a musical duo from Bures-sur-Yvette, a suburb of Paris, started their musical careers at the age of 15. Taking inspiration from Baudelaireâ€™s Les Fleurs du mal, they adopted the name \"Orties\" (meaning \"nettles\" in French). Initially, the band explored gothic rock, but their sound evolved to incorporate rap music with French lyrics. They described this fusion of genres as the \"Nouvelle Chanson Francaise\" (New French Song).\nIn October 2010, Orties released their first EP titled La Boum under Believe Music. One of their controversial tracks, \"Plus putes que toutes les putes\" (Bitchier than any bitches), remixed by Lecter from Booty Call Records, gained attention when it was included in Skrillex's essential mix on BBC Radio.\nIn February 2013, Orties released their debut album, Sextape, through Nuun Records.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nOrties garnered support from various media outlets, including Technikart and mainstream publications such as Elle Magazine and Glamour. In June 2016, they were featured in a four-page spread in Les Inrockuptibles' special issue, with acclaimed authorMichel Houellebecq as the main contributor.\nOn 23 June 2016, Orties released a new single titled \"SEXEDROGUEHORREUR,\" accompanied by a music video directed by Jean Bocheux. The single showcased their unique style and continued exploration of the Nouvelle Chanson Francaise genre.\nFurthermore, Orties had plans to release their second album, also titled Nouvelle Chanson Francaise, in mid-2017, indicating their commitment to further develop and expand their musical endeavors.\n\n\n== References =="

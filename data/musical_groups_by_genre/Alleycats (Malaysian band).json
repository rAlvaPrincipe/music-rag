    "text": "The Alleycats is a Malaysian pop band which was formed in 1969, and gained popularity in the late 1970s. It consists of musicians from Penang who were popular in their home state earlier on in their career.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere were earlier line-ups of this band but the original line-up mentioned were the ones that took the Alleycats to great height of achievements musically. The Alleycats was always on top of the musical scene in Malaysia even before it was signed up as a recording band.\nThis line-up secured a performance contract in the Mocambo Club situated in Central, a business sector on Hong Kong island in 1976. It was supposed to be a three-month contract but the band's success in wooing the crowd earned it three yearly contracts bundled with TV and concert appearances as means of promoting the band. It became a hit with the locals in Hong Kong. It was not until it left Hong Kong to start a new performance contract in Singapore that the band was spotted by major recording companies.\nThe Alleycats started out in 1978 by signing a contract with Polygram Records-Philips to produce an album. It went to Hong Kong to record its album in Dragon Studio. Later, Lion Studio in Singapore was responsible for mastering the Alleycats' albums. Its first released album was Terima Kasih (Thank You) which featured cover songs of R&B hits from the Anglosphere, but also had originals like their first single Senandung Semalam (lit. 'Yesterday's Serenade'). Their 1990 album C.I.N.T.A. represented a departure from pop music into rock.\nThe existence of this band was vital to the Malaysian music industry. With more than twenty recordings, it had contributed to the development of the Malaysian music industry and is still regarded as one of the legendary Malaysian pop music bands of all time in the country. Despite the  changes, the band is still active in performing and recording. The Alleycats have a strong fan base from all walks of life in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nDavid Arumugam - vocals (1969 - present)\nGlenville Charles Salay - vocals\nPriyadashini Loganathan (also known as Dasha Loga) - vocals\nDavid John - drums\nNazaruddin Abdullah - lead guitar\nLoh Kum Swee (also known as Jimmy Loh) - bass guitar\nPrawing Aroonratana (also known as Mike Prawing) - keyboards\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nLoganathan Arumugam - vocals (1969 - 2007); died 2007\nTan Chin Hock - drums\nShunmugam Arumugam - lead guitar\nChester Anthony Passerella - saxophone\nKhoo Fook Sin and Grenville Pereira (Gren) - keyboards\nFrank Ong - bass guitar\nRamesh - lead guitar\nTheir music is said to be influenced by Air Supply, Phil Collins, Bee Gees, Billy Joel, David Gates & Bread, Santana and Paul McCartney.\nMost of the Alleycats albums were produced by Eric Yeo.

    "text": "Totally Gourdgeous are an Australian folk band, in which the members' instruments are manufactured from gourds made by the group's Penelope Swales. They formed in Melbourne in 1998, with Swales on guitar, stomp box, hulusi, aslatuas, mandolin, vocals; Andrew Clermont on fiddle, guitar, mandolin and vocals; Carl Pannuzzo on drums, guitar and vocals; and Mal Webb on fretless bass guitar, mbira, gourd trumpet and vocals. The group made their live debut at the 1999-2000 Woodford Folk Festival, and have become popular mainstays of folk and country festivals around Australia. The group have released five albums, the two most recent of which being distributed by MGM. During performances and recording the members alternate lead and backing vocals, typically depending on who wrote each song. Their music style ranges from folk-rock and country to soul and funk, and their lyrics, whilst typically comedic or tongue-in-cheek in nature, frequently cover topics including peace, conservation, philosophy, love, and activism.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAndrew Clermont – fiddle, guitar, mandolin, vocals\nCarl Pannuzzo – percussion, drums, guitar, vocals\nPenelope Swales – guitar, stomp box, hulusi, aslatuas, mandolin, vocals\nMal Webb – bass guitar, mbira, gourd trumpet, vocals\nThe members take turns as lead vocalist and backing vocalists.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nTotally Gourdgeous (2000) – Independent (GRD1)\nD'vine (2002) – Independent (GRD2)\nThe Stroke of Midnight (2005) – Independent (GRD3)\nPun Kin (2011) – Independent/MGM Distribution (GRD4)\nGourd in the Act (2020) – Independent/MGM Distribution (GRD5)\nPlus 3 DVDs\nThe Bazaar Clips (2007)  – Independent - Live @ Woodford Folk Fest\nShades of the Vine (2014) Independent - Live @ Enrec Studio\nThe Ripe Stuff - Independent - Live @ West End, Brisbane\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website archived from the original on 28 February 2015, accessed on 6 December 2018."

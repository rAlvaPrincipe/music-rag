    "text": "I were a Norwegian black metal supergroup formed in 2003. The band featured Immortal frontman Abbath, Enslaved guitarist Ice Dale, Gorgoroth bassist TC King and former Immortal drummer Armagedda. I released their debut studio album, Between Two Worlds, in 2006 and performed their sole show at the Hole in the Sky festival in Bergen that same year. Although work had begun on songs for a follow-up album, the band ceased to exist following the release of their debut album due to the members' commitment to their other bands. \n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing Immortal's split and hiatus in 2003, frontman Abbath began working on new material and enlisted Enslaved guitarist Ice Dale to assist with pre-production. The duo started rehearsing with original Immortal drummer Armagedda and were later joined by Gorgoroth bassist TC King. The band's first and only live show took place at the Hole in the Sky festival in Bergen on 26 August 2006. I's debut album, Between Two Worlds, was released on 3 November 2006 in Europe and 14 November 2006 in the United States through Nuclear Blast Records. The band's sound was described as \"a fusing of the mammoth black metal anthems of the mighty Immortal and a pronounced rock 'n' groove component that borrows from the likes of Motörhead.\" In December 2006, Abbath stated that he had started working on new songs for the next album, although no further comment has been made on the project since. During that same year, Immortal reformed for a series of shows and later began work on a new album. In 2015, Abbath left Immortal and formed an eponymous band along with former I bassist TC King. Abbath has regularly covered the I track \"Warriors\" live since 2015.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAbbath Doom Occulta (Olve Eikemo) – vocals, guitar\nIce Dale (Arve Isdal) – guitar\nTC King (Tom Cato Visnes) – bass\nArmagedda (Gerhard Herfindal) – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBetween Two Worlds (2006)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (archived)\nOfficial band page at Nuclear Blast"

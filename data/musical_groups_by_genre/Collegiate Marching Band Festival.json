    "text": "The Collegiate Marching Band Festival, also called the CMBF, is an annual event held in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The festival showcases college and university marching bands of all sizes and styles from across the Northeastern United States. \nFirst held in 1996, the event typically takes places in early October at J. Birney Crum Stadium, a renowned venue for marching band and drum corps performances and the largest high school football stadium in the Mid-Atlantic United States. \nThe festival is not a competition, but an opportunity for fans and band members alike to view bands that perform a variety of shows and exhibit different performance styles.\n\n\n== Management and sponsors ==\nThe festival is currently managed by Vivace Productions, Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Different Styles ==\nWhile many of the participating bands perform contemporary “ corps style” shows using roll-step marching, other performance varieties abound. Morgan State University, from Baltimore, Maryland, performs a high-energy show typical of southern HBCU bands.  Lehigh University and Penn State University, both of which have participated in the past, perform traditional \"Big Ten\" style shows with a high-step marching technique (the coincidence that Penn State is in the  Big Ten). Other bands, including Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Kutztown University, West Chester University, The University of Delaware, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, have developed unique styles all their own: the corps-style type with the roll-step and other drill techniques. Boston University’s Terrier Marching Band used the corps-style type, but it was disbanded in 2016, due to lack of football.\n\n\n== Traditions ==\nCelebrating its 21st occurrence in 2016, the festival has a number of traditions, which spectators and performers have come to anticipate on an annual basis.\nOrder of performance\n\nThe order of performance is rotated on an annual basis although it still follows a pattern where smaller-sized bands perform early in the day and larger bands perform later. As a custom, the first band to perform also plays the National Anthem to signify the start of the festival.\nVendors\n\nThe festival features an area for vendors to set up information booths. Vendors have included companies involved in the marching arts, drum and bugle corps from both Drum Corps International and Drum Corps Associates, and recruiting tables for participating schools.\nConcessions\n\nJ. Birney Crum Stadium boasts some eccentric food choices. Among them can be found fried pierogies and giant Hawaiian Shave Ices that resemble softball-sized snow cones. Many festival-goers make these treats a regular part of the annual event.\nMusical Organizations\n\nThe Collegiate Marching Band Festival is traditionally staffed by the Eta Rho chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi and the Zeta Upsilon chapter of Tau Beta Sigma. Members of these organizations from several chapters use the festival as a time to gather together and socialize while engaging in their own particular traditions.\nAdditional musical fraternities such as Phi Mu Alpha also congregate at this time.\nAlumni and members of area drum corps gather and socialize at the event; most notably the Reading Buccaneers gather annually at the end of the event on or near the field. \nStudents, staff, and alumni from the participating bands take this opportunity to commingle with other members and before all the schools depart. \nMany of the organizations sing their respective hymn/song before departing the festival.\nTubas/Sousaphones\n\nAfter the last band performs, the tuba and sousaphone players from several of the larger bands congregate at the center of the field to play traditional tunes, socialize with each other, and generally put on a humorous display for the exiting crowds.  This congregation is called \"The Clusterfun\".\n\n\n== Performing Ensembles (2003-2014) ==\n\n\n=== 8th Annual CMBF ===\nSunday, September 21, 2003 - Order of Appearance\n\nKutztown University Marching Unit\nLehigh University – Marching 97\nLebanon Valley College – The Pride of the Valley\nGettysburg College – Bullet Marching Band\nBoston University – Terrier Marching Band\nCalifornia University of Pennsylvania Marching Band\nMillersville University – Marauder Marching Band\nShippensburg University – Red Raider Marching Band\nShepherd University – Ram Band\nMorgan State University – The Magnificent Marching Machine\nIndiana University of Pennsylvania – The Legend\nLiberty University – The Spirit of the Mountain\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst – Minuteman Marching Band The Power and Class of New England\nMansfield University – The Pride of Pennsylvania\nUniversity of Delaware – Fightin’ Blue Hen Marching Band\nWest Chester University – Incomparable Golden Rams Marching Band\n\n\n=== 9th Annual CMBF ===\nSunday, October 10, 2004 -

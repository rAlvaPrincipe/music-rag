    "text": "The Real Nasty is a Berkeley, California country/rock music-based band.  The band's members are Ryan Lukas (the main songwriter, lead vocals, upright bass), Sean Williams (electric guitar) and Brian Huston (percussion). The music has been described  as \"countrified rock\", and draws from a range of musical genres including bluegrass, world music, and country music.\nIn 2009, The Real Nasty was signed to Ninth Street Opus, an independent record label out of Berkeley, CA. They immediately released Paper City, a double disk album. The disks were EP's unto themselves as they each had their own title and genre. The Sticks contained country while Downtown was rock-based. In October 2010, the follow-up to Paper City was released. Strangers and Friends was described as compelling fusion of countrified rock. October 2011 saw the release of their third studio album, Dirty Dollars, which incorporates elements of rock, country, blues, funk, and soul.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Real Nasty was formed in Berkeley, California, in 2009.

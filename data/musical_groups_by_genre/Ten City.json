    "text": "Ten City (derived from intensity) is an American, Chicago, Illinois-based R&B and house music act, that enjoyed a number of club hits and Urban radio hits in the late 1980s and early 1990s and was one of the first exponents of deep house. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nFormerly known as Ragtyme, the group comprised vocalist Byron Stingily, guitarist Herb Lawson and keyboardist Byron Burke and were augmented by producer Marshall Jefferson. The group was signed by Atlantic Records and released the album Foundation in 1989, which became the group's only album to cross over, peaking at No. 49 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.\nTen City is best known for the singles \"Devotion\", \"Right Back to You\" and \"That's the Way Love Is,\" which hit No. 1 on the US dance chart and No. 8 on the UK Top 40 in 1989. Stingily, who left the group and became a successful solo artist, re-recorded the song and brought it back to No. 1 on the US dance chart in 1999.\nIn 2021, Stingily teamed up with producer Marshall Jefferson to release \"Be Free\" on Ultra Music, the first single in 25 years to be credited to Ten City. Its parent album, Judgment, was nominated for a Grammy Award that year in the category of Best Dance/Electronic Album.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nThe Best of Ten City (Ibadan, 2001)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one dance hits (United States)\nList of artists who reached number one on the U.S. dance chart\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTen City discography at Discogs \nTen City at AllMusic\nByron Stingily 2012 Audio Interview at Soulinterviews.com"

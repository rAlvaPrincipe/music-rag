Psyclones are a long-standing band with a diverse sound, ranging from punk/post-rock/synth-pop to electronic industrial/ambient music. They released their Greatest Hits (1981â€“1991) CD which spans over a decade of intensely rich, enthusiastic music and lyrics that exemplify an era in their creative past.  Sounds range from hardcore punk/grunge/rock to industrial-core noise rock. Most of the tracks are very dance worthy. The overall sound is heavy and harsh, \"musical mayhem.\" Psyclones also put out many lps and singles on other their own label Ladd-Frith.

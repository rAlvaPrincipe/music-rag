    "text": "Kalafina (カラフィナ) is a Japanese vocal group formed by composer Yuki Kajiura in 2007, mainly to perform theme songs for the anime The Garden of Sinners, but later expanded to include many other theme songs for other anime shows and films including the Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Black Butler, The Heroic Legend of Arslan and Fate/stay night franchises. They released five albums that have charted in the top 10 for Oricon. Kalafina disbanded in 2019, but regrouped on October 3, 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group first appeared in January 2008 with two original members from Yuki Kajiura's FictionJunction project, Wakana Ōtaki and Keiko Kubota, whose membership was not confirmed until the first Dream Port 2008 concert held on April 29, 2008. In May 2008, it was announced that two more vocalists, Maya Toyoshima and Hikaru Masai, would be added to the project. Kalafina moved to the Sacra Music record label under Sony Music Entertainment Japan in April 2017. In 2009, Toyoshima left the group, resulting in a trio. In an interview with the group at Anime Central, the concept of Kalafina differs from FictionJunction in that Kajiura does not perform on stage with the singers, but serves as an off-stage producer and songwriter.\nWith Yuki Kajiura leaving her agency Space Craft Produce in 2018, news agency Oricon reported that the group was expected to continue even with Kajiura leaving. Space Craft has further announced that concerts and 10th anniversary film's plans would still move forward. Despite the band being expected to disband in spring, Space Craft reported to the official fan club that only one member will leave Kalafina. Although rumors said that Hikaru would leave the group, Sports Hochi reported that the member that would leave the group was Keiko, and that official news about who was leaving the group would be announced at the end of March 2018. It was confirmed on April 13, 2018 on Kalafina Lineblog that Keiko had officially left the group as of April 1, 2018. Following this, Hikaru left the agency as of October 20, 2018, although she did not state that she left the group. Finally, on March 13, 2019, Space Craft announced Kalafina's break up.\nOn October 3, 2024, Keiko, Wakana, and Hikaru announced that they have reunited due to fan support, with a concert planned for their anniversary on January 15, 2025 in Tokyo Garden Theater with Satoshi Takebe as their music producer. On the same day when the reunion was announced, Yuki Kajiura revealed that she had not been informed beforehand and wrote, \"I think that from now on, everyone in Kalafina has decided to leave me as their producer and to walk their own path as a new Kalafina without my knowledge.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Main vocalists ===\nKeiko (ケイコ, born December 5, 1985): Like Wakana, she is also a member of Kajiura's FictionJunction project and worked alongside her under the name FictionJunction KEIKO.

    "text": "Job Karma is a post-industrial-ambient band from Wrocław. It was created in 1998 by Maciej Frett (born 1973) and Aureliusz Pisarzewski (born 1974). In the first period (before 1999) Jacek Groszek (born 1973) was also a member of the band.\nPerformances of the group have the form of audiovisual art. Visuals are done by Arkadiusz Bagiński (born 1969) – an artist dealing with drawings, performances and visual arts.\nJob Karma makes their music using sound generators and electric analogue-digital instruments, the band also fits trance rhythms, ambient textures, samples, fragments of movie dialogues and archival radio transmissions into it.\nThematically the Job Karma's compositions are focused on negative aspects and dangers of modern civilization, addressing social, political and religious issues.\nFrom 2000 the band realizes the project „Rytuał\" (Ritual), in which during live performances they join the music and music materials together with sacral and industrial architecture.\nFrom 2001 Maciej Frett and Arkadiusz Bagiński are the organisers of the Wrocław Industrial Festival.\nThe musicians are in good relations with In The Nursery band and the Sheffield based record label Redroom. Their 2005 album Strike included a cover version of the track Radioactivity by Kraftwerk and a I'll Watch You Drown remix by Matt Howden of Redroom studios.\nMatt Howden and Job Karma have released a new album in May 2012, Anthems Flesh, under the band name  7JK – Sieben Vs.

Jimmy Iovine\nsigned them to his Interscope label. The name of the group was changed to Clique Girlz because there was already a group called \"Clique\". On\nMarch 28, 2008, they went to Tokyo, Japan to work on their first full-length album, Incredible.\nThe following month, they released a three-song EP. That summer the girls did several shows at Six Flags and other\nvenues opening for artists including Drake Bell and Demi Lovato, performing songs from the girls' upcoming album.

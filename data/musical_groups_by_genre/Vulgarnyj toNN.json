The group was composed of rAp, Ksandra, CLassic, Kore, and OST.\nThe band disbanded in 2011.\n\n\n== History ==\nVulgarnyj toNN was established on July 27, 2005. Initially, the band consisted of rAp and OST. In 2006, Ksandra, a singer, and CLassic, an MC, joined the band. Kore became a member in 2009. In the same year, OST relocated to Moscow and collaborated with the bands Rynochnye Otnosheniya (Russian: Рыночные Отношения) and Chernaya Ekonomika (Russian: Чёрная Экономика). He released a solo album and multiple tracks in collaboration with those bands. Although OST's contributions to Vulgarnyj toNN became minimal, he is still officially considered a band member.\n\n\n== Participations in rap-battles ==\n\n\n=== Hip-Hop.Ru Battles ===\nVulgarnyj toNN participated in several rap-battles, both as a team and individually. In 2007, the band reached the finals of the \"5th command battle Hip-Hop.Ru,\" but was defeated by Mychanie Yagnyat (Russian: Мычание Ягнят), led by the renowned rap artist Maestro A-Sid.\n\n\n=== Team battle \"Ostatsya v Zhivyh\" ===\nIn 2007, Vulgarnyj toNN won the team battle \"Ostatsya v Zhivyh\" (Russian: Остаться в Живых, Russian for Lost), hosted by RapVladivostok.ru.

Among them, only CLassic achieved significant success. In the first InDaBattle, CLassic reached the semi-final but was defeated by the eventual winner, Chet, largely due to disagreements with one of the judges, David Nuriev (Russian: Давид Нуриев), known by the pseudonym Ptaha. However, CLassic then participated in the \"InDaBattle\" festival, which included winners and semifinalists of the battle, along with special guests.\nCLassic also competed in the second InDaBattle.

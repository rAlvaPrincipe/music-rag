    "text": "The Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra is one of the oldest youth orchestra programs in the United States, having performed its first concert under the direction of Stanley H. Levin in 1945 at Carnegie Music Hall in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA.  The idea of an independent youth orchestra in Pittsburgh originated with the student musicians that participated in the Music Festival of the In-and-About Pittsburgh Music Educators Club.   It is most often represented by its initials, PYSO, affectionately pronounced “Pie-So” by members, alumni and supporters.\nThe first President of the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra was Vira I. Heinz (sister-in-law of Howard Heinz) who held that position until 1981.  After a brief hiatus (1948 to 1953) the Orchestra was reorganized by Mrs. Heinz and Marie Maazel, mother of conductor Lorin Maazel. Karl Kritz, Assistant Conductor with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, became Music Director. Rehearsals and concerts were held at Pittsburgh’s Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall until 1971, when the Loew's Penn Theater in downtown Pittsburgh was renovated and renamed Heinz Hall. At that time the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra became affiliated with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. PYSO made its home at Heinz Hall, at which it gives four free concerts a year, but it also undertakes international tours.\n\n\n== Music Directors ==\nMusic Directors of the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra were Stanley H. Levin (1945–1948),\nKarl Kritz (1954–1962), Herbert Grossman (1962–1963), Haig Yaghjian (1963–1965), Ronald Ondrejka (1965–1966), Phillip Spurgeon (1966–1969), Michael Semanitzky (1969–1976), Thomas Michalak (1976–1978), Victoria Bond (1978–1980), Michael Lankester (1980–1986), Andreas Delfs (1986–1988), Stephan Lano (1988–1991), Barbara Yahr (1991–1994), Arthur Post (1994–1997), Edward Cumming (1997–2002), Daniel Meyer (2002–2009), Lawrence Loh (2009–2015), Francesco Lecce-Chong (2015–2018), Earl Lee (2018-2021), and Jacob Joyce(2022-present).

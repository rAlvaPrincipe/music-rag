    "text": "Sugar Jones was a Canadian all-female pop group created on the first season of the Canadian version of Popstars in 2001. It consisted of five members chosen from thousands of contestants who auditioned all over Canada in hopes of gaining a spot in the group. In 2001, they released their debut and only album, which was self-titled, in the summer of 2001, that featured the singles \"Days Like That\" (a cover of the Fierce song) and \"How Much Longer\", both gaining fair amount of airplay on Canadian Radio throughout 2001. Sugar Jones studio album was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. After mostly local Canadian success, Watson would leave the group in March of 2002 to be with her husband, singer Remy Shand. The remaining members would briefly continue on, as they had their sights set for the UK market. However, this venture saw little to no success, and Sugar Jones would ultimately disband in 2003.\n\n\n== After disbanding ==\nAfter disbanding, each member pursued various interests, with Julie and Andrea both releasing solo albums in 2008. \nJulie has since married and has 2 children, as well as shifted careers to interior design and home renovation, starting a home renovation company with her husband. \nAndrea continues to work in music as an administrator in arts & event services.\nSahara MacDonald released an album independently and starred in several theatre productions, including Toronto's production of We Will Rock You. \nShe is now a yoga instructor. \nMaiko Watson released her solo album, Sweet Vibration, in 2009, which received Best Urban Album at the 2010 Western Canadian Music Awards.

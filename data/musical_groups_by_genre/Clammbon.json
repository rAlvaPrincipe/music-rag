    "text": "Clammbon (クラムボン, Kuramubon) is a Japanese musical trio, consisting of vocalist/keyboardist Ikuko Harada, bassist Mito and drummer  Daisuke Itou. The group, originally formed in 1996 when the three were students of the jazz department at SHOBI College of Music, made their major label debut on Warner Music Japan three years later. Their music is characterized by their quirky sound combining jazzy chord progressions with J-pop and electronica influences. They left their major label and went indie in 2015. \nThe name Clammbon is taken from a fictional character in the Kenji Miyazawa novel Yamanashi.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Original albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Other albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website  (in Japanese)\nClammbon discography at Discogs \nDramatickers, unofficial English fansite"

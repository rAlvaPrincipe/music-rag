    "text": "Wagëblë are a Senegalese hip hop act. Their debut album was released in 2003.\n\n\n== About ==\nWagëblë is made up of Eyewitness, aka Lamine Kandji and Waterflow, aka Papa Moussa Lo, who began making music together in 1997. Wageble are from Thiaroye, a ghetto on the outskirts of Senegal's capital, Dakar. According to the group, they represent the disenfranchised youth of Senegal and Africa, and work towards social change in Senegal.\nAccording to Wagëblë, their style draws on the tradition of the griot - a Senegalese storyteller, oral historian and social critic. Their lyrics take aim at issues like social injustice, political corruption and conflict, while also covering personal topics like love and family. Their name, Wagëblë is a Wolof word that means \"from the ghetto.\" It is also an acronym for Wax Aduna Gëddu Ëttu Baatin Lemu Ëlëk – an expression of the group's philosophy about truth and the spreading of knowledge.\nWagëblë describe their music as Rap Afro - a style heavily influenced by American hip hop, but focusing on themes that speak to, and about, Africa. Their music mixes rap, poetry and spoken word with hip hop beats and traditional African instruments.  Wagëblë rap in Wolof, French and English.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Wageb' Rap New Generation (2003) ===\nIn 2003 Wagëblë released their first studio album, Wageb' Rap New Generation, in collaboration with manager Fred Russel and producer Tom Roger Rumblin' from Norwegian label Two Thou Entertainment.

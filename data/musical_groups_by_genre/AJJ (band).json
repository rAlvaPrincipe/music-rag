    "text": "AJJ is an American folk punk band from Phoenix, Arizona, originally formed in 2004 as Andrew Jackson Jihad. Their lyrics handle themes of shyness, poverty, humanity, religion, addiction, existentialism, and politics. Singer/guitarist Sean Bonnette and bassist Ben Gallaty co-founded the band, and have remained its only constant members throughout. The band has released nine studio albums to date, with their most recent, Disposable Everything Else, having been released on June 14, 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAJJ (formerly known as Andrew Jackson Jihad) was formed by Sean Bonnette, Ben Gallaty, and drummer Justin James White, who left the band soon after. They recorded the band's first LP, Candy Cigarettes & Cap Guns, released through the Audioconfusion Manifesto label in 2005.\nOn April 15, 2006, the band played as part of the 2006 New Times Music Showcase, nominated for Best Americana Band, and won a Best of Phoenix award later that year.\nThey released a split LP with Ghost Mice on Plan-It-X-Records in 2007. Following this, Asian Man Records issued their second full-length album, People Who Can Eat People Are the Luckiest People in the World, on September 11, 2007.\nIn 2008 the band was a part of the Asian Man Records' \"Making Punk Fun Again\" tour with The Queers, Bomb the Music Industry!, Lemuria, and Kepi Ghoulie. 2008 also saw the release of \"Only God Can Judge Me\", a mostly acoustic EP on Plan-it-X Records.\nIn 2009, the band's third record, Can't Maintain, was released by Asian Man Records. They toured the US with Kepi Ghoulie and Partners in 818. At this point, the band consisted of Bonnette, Gallaty, Deacon Batchelor on drums, and Preston Bryant on guitar and keyboards.\nIn 2010, the band toured the US with Blunt Mechanic, Europe with Kepi Ghoulie, and the west coast with Royal Monsters.\n2011 had the band go on their second European tour. They also played festivals such as Plan-It-X Fest and the Asian Man Records 15th Anniversary. Mark Glick joined the band, rounding out the sound with cello parts. The fourth full-length album, Knife Man, was released on September 20 by Asian Man Records and on cassette by Lauren Records. In support of this record, the band was part of a full US tour with Frank Turner and Into It. Over It.\n2012 was a busy year of extensive touring. In March, the band toured with Laura Stevenson and ROAR, which was quickly followed by another tour in April with Joyce Manor and Treasure Fleet. In September, the band did a short string of shows with Against Me! and Joyce Manor, followed by a full US tour with Future of the Left and Jeff Rosenstock.\n2013 saw yet another busy year for the band. In April, Bonnette went on a solo tour with Ian Graham of Cheap Girls. He also collaborated on a track with Sole that was released in May. In September, the band's first live album, \"Live at the Crescent Ballroom\", was released by Asian Man Records and on cassette by Lauren Records. In November, the band embarked on a west coast tour with The Gunshy. In June, the band had recorded a new album entitled Christmas Island with John Congleton and members of their full touring lineup Preston Bryant and Deacon Batchelor. The album was released on May 6, 2014, on Side One Dummy Records.\nIn 2016, the band officially changed their name from \"Andrew Jackson Jihad\" to AJJ (a moniker that many of their fans had been using to refer to them for several years). In a statement on the band's website, Bonnette wrote \"1.) We are not Muslims, and as such, it is disrespectful and irresponsible for us to use the word jihad in our band's name. 2.) We no longer wish to be a living reminder of the president Andrew Jackson. Interesting historical figure as he was, he was an odious person and our fascination with him has grown stale.\"\nOn June 28, 2016, AJJ announced their 6th studio album, The Bible 2, along with a tracklist and pre-order bundles. The band also released a music video for the album's lead single, \"Goodbye, Oh Goodbye.\" The clip is a style parody of the viral video approach to music videos made by the band OK Go. On 1 August 2016, the music video for \"Junkie Church\" was released.\nIn 2017, the band released an EP on Lauren Records of new material entitled Back in the Jazz Coffin, consisting of acoustic songs. They also released Decade of Regression, a live album as a Record Store Day exclusive.\nIn August 2017, after Chris Clavin of Plan-It-X Records was \"accused of and acknowledged a pattern of sexual abuse\", AJJ took their music off of the label and re-released it themselves.\nOn October 30, 2019, AJJ announced a new studio album titled Good Luck Everybody. This announcement coincided with the release of \"A Poem\", the lead single from the album. After three more singles and two music videos, for \"Mega Guillotine 2020\" and \"Loudmouth\", Good Luck Everybody was released on January 17, 2020. Unlike previous releases, Good Luck Everybody is self-published under a newly formed label entitled \"AJJ unlimited LTD\". Later that year, following the release of the album, the band shared a cover of Silver Jews' \"Candy Jail\" for the Songs That Saved My Life initiative as well as a stand-alone single \"Horsehair Vase\" – backed with a cover of \"You, Swan, Go On\" by Mount Eerie. This structure followed for the band's next standalone single in 2021, \"I Wanna Be Your Dog 2\" – which was backed with a cover of Guided by Voices' \"Motor Away\".\nIn December 2022, the band shared a new song titled \"The Baby Panda\", which features backing vocals from Laura Stevenson. The following month, the band would announce their eighth studio album Disposable Everything – along with the release of its title track and another new song, \"Dissonance\" – as well as their signing to Hopeless Records. The album, released in May 2023, also featured \"I Wanna Be Your Dog 2\" and \"The Baby Panda\". It was their first album to include drummer Kevin Higuchi as a full-time member of the band, having been inducted officially the year prior.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

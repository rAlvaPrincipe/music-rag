    "text": "Necronomidol was a Japanese idol heavy metal group, formed in 2014. They have been on more than three international tours and have performed in over 12 countries.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe group is a prominent act in the alternative idol and kawaii metal movements. Their name is taken from the Necronomicon, the famous fictional grimoire featured in the work of H. P. Lovecraft, combined with the Japanese words for magic (魔, ma) and necromancy (ネクロ魔, nekuro ma), and \"idol\". Necronomidol has performed once at the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival and twice at CthulhuCon, in 2018 and 2020. A number of composers have worked with them, such as Mr. Perkele, who has worked on tracks such as \"Ritual\" and \"Dawnslayer\". The group is managed by Ricky Wilson, an American expat living in Tokyo. They began with visuals inspired by a traditional Japanese \"shrine maiden\" look with \"haunting\" overtones, first seen in their earliest videos from 2014, but their image later incorporated elements of the Cthulhu mythos as well as modern Japanese and Western horror.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nNecronomidol's style has been described as fusing J-pop with genres ranging from industrial music to punk rock to dark wave to witch house to shoegazing to, most notably, heavy metal, specifically the style of black metal. Because of this, they have been described as kawaii metal and post-black metal.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nNemesis (2016)\nDeathless (2017)\nVoidhymn (2018)\nvämjelseriter (2021)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nFrom Chaos Born (2016)\nDawn Slayer (2017)\nStrange Aeons (2018)\nScions of the Blasted Heath (2019)\nl'appel du vide (2022)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Ikotsu Moufubuki\" (2015)\n\"Reikon Shoumetsu\" (2015)\n\"Etranger\" (2015)\n\"Exitum\" (2015)\n\"TUPILAQ\" (2020)\n\"Santa Sangre\" (2020)\n\n\n== Members ==\nKaede (2014)\nKagura Nagata (2014)\nAisa Miyano (2014)\nRio Maeda (2014)\nSetsuko Henmei (2014–2015)\nRū Tachibana (2014–2015)\nKaren Kusaka (2015–2016)\nHotaru Tsukumo (2014–2016)\nSari (2014–2019, left to focus on solo work)\nHina Yotsuyu (2015–2019, left to join MANACLE)\nKunogi Kenbishi (2019)\nRisaki Kakizaki (2014-2020 left to join MANACLE)\nRei Imaizumi (2016–2020, left to join MANACLE)\nHimari Tsukishiro (2017–2022)\nMichelle (2019–2020)\nShiki Rukawa (2020-2021, left to focus on solo work, her YouTube channel)\nRoa Toda (2020-2021, left after originally going on hiatus, has collaborated with Shiki on Shiki's YouTube channel)\nMaria Hoshizora (2021, left because of health issues)\nNana Kamino (2020-2021)\nTowa Amou (2021-2022)\nHisui Kurogane (2022)\nMeica Mochinaga (2021-2022)\nMalin Kozakura (2021-2022)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== References =="

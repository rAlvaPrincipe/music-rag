    "text": "Nebulossa (Spanish pronunciation: [neβuˈlosa]) is a Spanish electropop duo from Ondara, consisting of singer María \"Mery\" Bas (born 29 December 1967) and keyboardist and producer Mark Dasousa (born 5 May 1975).\nOn 3 February 2024, the duo won the Benidorm Fest 2024 with the song \"Zorra\", earning the right to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2024, where they finished in 22nd place.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBas and Dasousa have been married for over 20 years. Together they have two children.\nNebulossa formed in 2018. The name of the group alludes to nebulae (nebulosa in Spanish and in Portuguese ) because on a trip to Port Ainé they went to an astronomical observatory where they constantly mentioned them. The double S is a symbolic reference to the Catalan language, where many words use this spelling.\nIn 2022, as a trio together with Ophelia Alibrando, they participated in Una voce per San Marino, San Marino's preselection contest for the Eurovision Song Contest 2023, but did not progress past the audition stage. Nebulossa competed in Benidorm Fest 2024, the Spanish selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024, with the song \"Zorra\". They placed first in their semi-final on 30 January 2024, qualifying for the final of the Fest, which they won. Nebulossa then participated on 9 May at the Malmö Arena in the second semi-final, joined by Ana Villa who played percussion with luminous drumsticks.  During the grand final, held on 11 May, Nebulossa performed in eighth place,  ​but after adding the votes of the specialized jury and the televote they obtained a total of 30 points, placing 22nd.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n== References =="

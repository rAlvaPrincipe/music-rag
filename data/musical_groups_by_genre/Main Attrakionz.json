    "text": "Main Attrakionz is an American hip hop duo from Oakland, California, composed of rappers Mondre M.A.N. (Damondre Grice) and Squadda B (Charles Glover).\n\n\n== Career ==\nGrice and Glover met in the seventh grade when they were both kicked out of math class, and began recording raps together. The two have continued to collaborate and have become known as significant players in the \"cloud rap\" movement, which features \"a splinter sound that's ethereal and often hooked around cascading synth lines and amorphous beats\".\nOn March 2, 2012, Main Attrakionz released Cloudlife, a collaborative EP with Jel and Zachg. On October 22, 2012, the duo released their first album, Bossalinis & Fooliyones, which was noted in Spin to have \"nine-song run from 'On Tour' to 'Bury Me a Millionaire' is as impressive as anything on a rap record this year\". On their review of the album, Pitchfork said of the duo, \"here are two guys who clearly love to rap and work hard at it, taking a style they can call their own, and presenting it in a more user-friendly way. More often than not, they make it work\".\nOn March 11, 2013, the duo collaborated with Montreal-based production duo, Grown Folk and Berlin dubstep artist, Kuedo to release the Cloud City EP, which SF Weekly noted as \"probably one of their more out-there collaborations to date\". On June 30, 2015, the duo released 808s & Dark Grapes III, which was produced by Friendzone.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBossalinis & Fooliyones (2012)\n808s & Dark Grapes III (2015)\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\nSelf Made Classic Vol. I: Zombies on tha Turf (2009)\nMain Attrakionz Hip Hop (2009)\nRackstylin' 101 (2010)\nBest Duo Ever: The Greentape (2010)\nBlood Money (2010)\nWardrobe Music (2010)\nTwo Man Horror Film (2011)\nBlackberry Ku$h (2011)\nChandelier (2011)\n808s & Dark Grapes (2011)\n808s & Dark Grapes II (2011)\nChandelier Redux (2012)\nTag Champz Bundle (2012)\nBest Duo Ever: The Bricktape (2013)\nMain Attrakionz x Tynethys (2013) (with Tynethys)\nMain Attrakionz Niggaz (2013)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nNiggas on the Run Eatin (2011)\nCloudlife (2012) (with Jel and Zachg)\nCloud City EP (2013) (with Grown Folk)\nJeffro (2013)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Perfect Skies\" / \"Chuch\" (2011)\n\"Rap Paradise\" (2012)\n\"Zombies on the Turf Pt. 2\" (2012)\n\"Women We Chase\" (2012)\n\"Green Ova to the Top\" (2012) (with Shady Blaze)\n\"Do It for the Bay\" (2012)\n\"Higher\" (2015) (with Danham)\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\nSpaceghostpurrp - \"StonerGang Raiders\" from Blvcklvnd Rvdix 66.6 (2011)\nShady Blaze - \"Hood Nigga\" from Rappers Ain't $#!% Without a Producer (2011)\nSortahuman - \"Stonergang\" from Lysergic Bliss (2011)\nPeaking Lights - \"Marshmellow Yellow Remix\" from Remixes (2011)\nASAP Rocky - \"Leaf\" from Live.

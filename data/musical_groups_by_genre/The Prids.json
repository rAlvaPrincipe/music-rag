    "text": "The Prids are an American post-punk/indie rock band based in Portland, Oregon, led by former couple David Frederickson and Mistina La Fave. AllMusic described them as specializing in \"a moody form of indie rock influenced by '80s college radio stalwarts\",. and their influences include the Smiths, Unrest, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Built to Spill, Wire and Sonic Youth.\nThe Prids are known for following a strong DIY ethic, including the home recording of several of their records, booking their own tours and running their own Portland label collective, This-A-Way Records.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Prids were founded in the small town of St. Joseph, Missouri, in 1995 by Frederickson (guitar, vocals) and La Fave (bass, vocals). \nFrederickson moved to St. Joseph from Riverside, California after meeting a friend in rehab, with whom he’d started writing his first songs. He soon met La Fave, who attended one of his early shows. They eventually struck up a romance and formed The Prids soon after. The band name was a reference to a pet name that Frederickson had for La Fave. The group continued to develop in Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, and in Lincoln, they befriended Harry Dingman III, guitarist of 1980s post-punk band For Against.\nThe band relocated to Portland in November of 1999 over their mutual love of the band Team Dresch, and released their debut EP, Duracraft, in 2000 on the Death Tech Music label, featuring cover artwork by Dingman. In a contemporaneous live review, the Portland Mercury described the Prids as: \"Imagine if My Bloody Valentine and New Order decided to collaborate when they were both at their peaks\".\nThe Prids have performed with the likes of TV On the Radio, The Faint and Franz Ferdinand. Deerhunter played their first-ever show opening for The Prids in Atlanta, Georgia. The Prids played one of their earliest shows at the legendary Satyricon. \nTheir second EP, Glide, Screamer, was self-released in 2002, and The Prids released their debut full-length album, Love Zero, on May 6, 2003 on Luminal Records. The band went on to release two 7-inch singles on Luminal: \"Let It Go\" and \"Shadow and Shadow.”\nThe Prids signed with New York-based label Five03 Records, and released a second album, ...Until the World Is Beautiful (August 29, 2006) and a third EP, Something Difficult (October 9, 2007). \nOn July 20, 2008, the Prids were involved in a serious highway accident while driving south from San Francisco to Los Angeles. All four members and two of their significant others were injured to varying degrees, and their van and gear were destroyed. In the aftermath of the accident, fans and friends worldwide donated over $16,000 to help the band with medical bills and equipment costs, and Five03 released a digital-only benefit/tribute album, Dots to Connect: The Music of the Prids, featuring Prids covers by A Place to Bury Strangers, the Suffocation Keep (with Brett Nelson of Built to Spill), The Upsidedown, Entertainment, Helvetia (band) and others.\nIn 2009, the Prids issued the song \"Break\" on a split single with Lookbook. The band's third album, Chronosynclastic, featuring guest appearances from Doug Martsch of Built to Spill and Jason Albertini of Duster, was released on the Velvet Blue Music label on June 11, 2010.\nIn 2015, the Prids celebrated their 20th anniversary as a band, and in 2018 they released their fourth album, Do I Look Like I’m In Love? produced by Sean Flora (The Shins, Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, The Black Keys). \nThe Prids will release their fifth full-length album I Only Care About You and Me on Sept. 7, 2024, on This-A-Way Records. The album was produced by Larry Crane, and will include the first single, “Tell You Nothing.” \n\n\n== Members ==\nDavid Frederickson - guitar, vocals (1995–present)\nMistina La Fave - bass, vocals (1995–present)\nGeordie Thompson - drums (2019–present)\nCass Yates - keyboards, bass (2014–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nTrenor Rapki - keyboards (1998-2001)\nJairus Smith - drums, keyboards (1998-2004)\nLee Zeman - drums (2002-2005, 2009-2015)\nEric Hold - keyboards (2004-2007)\nJoey Maas - drums (2005- 2009)\nMaile Arruda - keyboards (2007-2015)\nGordon Nickel - drums (2015-2019)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nLove Zero (2003, Luminal Records; 2006, This-A-Way Records)\n...Until the World Is Beautiful (2006, Five03 Records)\nChronosynclastic (2010, Velvet Blue Music; 2011, This-A-Way Records)\nDo I Look Like I'm In Love?

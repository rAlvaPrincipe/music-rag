His father was not a musician but owned an extensive record collection which included classical music, which influenced David at a young age. Prior to college, Hattner attended the Interlochen Arts Camp in 1980 and from 1982 to 1984. He then spent three years at the Interlochen Arts Academy where he studied with Richard MacDowell and Frank Kowalsky, graduating in 1986. He has stated that his experiences at Interlochen inspired him to become a professional musician and conductor. In the summer of 1987, following his freshman year at Northwestern University where he studied clarinet performance under Robert Marcellus, Hattner was selected to perform at the Spoleto Music Festival in Italy. In 1988 he placed second in the International Clarinet Association's Young Artist Competition and was selected to be a member of the American-Soviet Youth Orchestra.

In April 2010 the Philharmonic was awarded the Oregon Symphony's Patty Vemer Excellence in Music Education Award, marking the first time the recognition for inspiring students was presented to an organization. Hattner accepted the award on the orchestra's behalf. In order to make use of all musicians in the Philharmonic as often as possible, Hattner often uses Romantic music and symphonies and ballets from the early 20th century in his programs. The Philharmonic began offering chamber orchestra concerts during his tenure.\n\n\n== Style and interests ==\nHattner has said of his conducting style, \"It is generally somewhat of a collaborative process between myself and the musicians, having been a player myself. I'm fairly specific about what I'm asking for in terms of the tempos and the phrasing, but bits of individual expression comes from the hearts and minds of the players themselves. I don't try to micromanage every detail.\" In addition to conducting and clarinet performance, Hattner has participated in multimedia work with silent film both nationally and internationally. He continues to perform clarinet in ensembles such as 45th Parallel, Martingale Ensemble and other projects.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of clarinetists\nList of Northwestern University alumni\nMusic education for young children\nMusic education in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo: David Hattner's appearance Archived 2010-11-01 at the Wayback Machine on Oregon Public Broadcasting's Oregon Experience"

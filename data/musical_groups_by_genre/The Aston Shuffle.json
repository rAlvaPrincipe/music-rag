    "text": "The Aston Shuffle is the name of Australian electronic music producer and DJ Vance Musgrove. They were initially a group until Mikah Freeman left in 2021, with Musgrove continuing on as a solo artist. In addition to DJ gigs and a recording career, the group hosted a weekly radio show on the ABC's Triple J on Friday nights called Friday Night Shuffle.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nThey rose to prominence with several remixes in 2006–2007 of Claude VonStroke's \"The Whistler\", Rocket Men's \"Candy\" and Chris Lake's \"Carry Me Away\", and released their debut single \"For Everyone\" in 2007 through the Ministry of Sound Australia's label Hussle Records, which was featured on the Ministry of Sound 2008 Annual.\nTheir music was regularly featured on Ministry compilations, with remixes of Pnau's \"Baby\", Terry Poison's \"24 Hours\" (featured on So You Think You Can Dance) and dance/alternative hip-hop smash hit \"Dance wiv Me\" from Dizzee Rascal and Calvin Harris. They also released their second single \"Stomp Yo Shoes\" that year working with Tommie Sunshine, and worked on their first compilation album for Ministry of Sound Australia, Mashed Four.\nIn 2009, the duo mixed the second disc of Ministry's Clubber's Guide to 2009, which also premiered their third single \"Do You Want More\". To close out a successful 2009, they were voted the number 3 DJs in Australia in the Sony inthemix50 and mixed disc 2 of The 2010 Annual for Ministry of Sound, which peaked at number 1 on the iTunes albums chart. They were voted the #1 DJs of inthemix50 in 2010, the same year they launched their Friday Night Shuffle radio show.\nTheir debut album Seventeen Past Midnight was released on 15 April 2011 and received a four-star review in Rolling Stone. Their track \"Your Love\" featured Eden Boucher of Lovers Electric on vocals, the first of two such collaborations. In 2012 a remix of their song \"Won't Get Lost\" by fellow Australian producer Tommy Trash was released as \"Sunrise (Won't Get Lost)\". It held the #1 spot on Beatport's chart for three consecutive weeks and was played by DJs such as David Guetta, Tiesto, Hardwell and Swedish House Mafia. On 2 February 2013, they supported Swedish House Mafia on their \"One Last Tour\" shows in Sydney and Melbourne. \"Won't Get Lost\" was also remixed by Rüfüs Du Sol and Flume.\nOn 28 March 2014, the duo released their second studio album, Photographs. It featured the gold-selling single \"Tear It Down,\" which was co-written with Amanda Ghost and nominated for an APRA Award in the category of Best Dance Work. The album also featured vocals from Mayer Hawthorne, Joel Compass, Kaelyn Behr, Elizabeth Rose, Lila Gold, Alice Katz from Youngblood Hawke, and Will Heard. In 2015, The Aston Shuffle Spotify Sessions, a live recording taken from one of the shows on their Photographs album tour, was released.\nIn 2016, they released the tracks \"High with You\", \"Only 1\" and \"Make a Wrong Thing Right\" on The Magician's Potion Records. The tracks were played by Pete Tong, Oliver Heldens and Martin Solveig. That year they also supported The Magician on a run of US and European tour dates.\nIn 2016 Grammy-Award winning R&B singer Maxwell asked The Aston Shuffle to remix his song \"All the Ways Love Can Feel\" from his album blackSUMMERS'night (2016). The remix was released that year by Columbia Records.\nIn 2017, they performed at Belgium's Tomorrowland and Hï Ibiza and released a number of singles, including two new tracks on Potion Records, \"Pass You By\" and \"Alpha Love\", and a collaboration with LO'99, \"Birthman\".\nAlso in 2017, they launched Only 100s, a monthly mix series that showcases their absolute favourite tracks of the month. The duo have also done events under the Only 100s name, with a 2017 tour of Australia featuring UK acts TCTS and Icarus and a 2018 event in New York, where Vance has been based since 2015.\nFrom 2017–2018 they toured internationally, then played 10 Australian cities in May 2018 on their \"ID Tour\" showcasing some of their new and upcoming material. In 2018 they were again invited to perform at Tomorrowland, alongside Pete Tong, Claptone, MK, and The Magician.\nOn 16 July 2021, Mikah Freeman announced his departure from the group, with The Aston Shuffle continuing on as a solo project. \n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== AIR Awards ===\nThe Australian Independent Record Awards (commonly known informally as AIR Awards) is an annual awards night to recognise, promote and celebrate the success of Australia's Independent Music sector.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nAvicii - \"Broken Arrows\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nAzari & III - \"Reckless With Your Love\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Modular]\nBunny Lake – \"Into the Future\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Klein]\nC-Jay & D-19 featuring Michelle Chirers – \"Nether Cutter\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nChris Lake – \"Carry Me Away\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Nervous]\nClaude VonStroke – \"The Whistler\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Dirty Bird]\nDatarock – \"Amarillion\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Nettwerk]\nDave Robertson – \"My Yellow Self\" (Knights of The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nDizzee Rascal featuring Calvin Harris & Chrome – \"Dance wiv Me\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Ministry of Sound]\nDom Dolla - \"You\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nElliphant featuring Skrillex - \"Spoon Me\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nEmpire of the Sun – \"DNA\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [EMI]\nFatboy Slim - \"Sunset [Bird of Prey]\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nFitz and the Tantrums – \"The Walker\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Atlantic]\nFull Mental Slackers – \"Auto Riot\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nGrafton Primary – \"All Stars\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nGreen Velvet – \"Shake & Pop\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nGrum – \"Can't Shake This Feeling\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Heartbeats]\nJames Harcourt – Gaila Melon (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nJoe Goddard featuring Valentina - \"Gabriel\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Greco Roman / DFA]\nJunior Jack - \"E-Samba\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nKissy Sell Out – \"Garden Friends\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nLes Gillettes - \"Pompeii\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nLondon Grammar – \"Wasting My Young Years\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Ministry of Sound]\nLost Valentinos – \"Nightmoves\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [etcetc]\nLostep – \"Villain\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nThe Magician (musician) - \"SHY\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nMalente – \"Killer Applikation\" (The Aston Shuffle Badonkadonk Remix) [Moonbootique]\nMalente vs. Azzido Da Bass – \"They're Killin' It\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Dim Mak]\nMaxwell - \"All The Ways Love Can Feel\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nN.A.S.A featuring Kanye West, Lykke Li & Santigold – \"Gifted\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nThe Nu Coalition – \"Born for the Nightlife\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nOwl Eyes – \"Golden Lies\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nPnau – \"Baby\" (The Aston Shuffle Just Whoah Remix) [etcetc]\nPompeii – \"Les Gilettes\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Kitsuné]\nThe Presets – \"Goodbye Future\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Modular]\nRhys – \"Hot Summer\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nRocket Men – \"Candy\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nShena – \"Electrosexual\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nSneaky Sound System - \"We Love\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Modular]\nThe Subs – \"Don't Stop\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\nTensnake featuring Fiora - \"Automatic\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Armada Music]\nTerry Poison – \"24 Hours\" (The Aston Shuffle A-Bomb Remix)\nThe Knocks featuring St. Lucia - \"Modern Hearts\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix) [Interscope]\nTronik Youth – \"Disko Suks\" (The Aston Shuffle Remix)\n\n\n=== Remix EPs ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nMashed Four (2008, Ministry of Sound) – Disc 2 of 2\nClubber's Guide to 2009 (2009, Ministry of Sound) – Disc 2 of 3\nThe 2010 Annual (2009, Ministry of Sound) – Disc 2 of 3\nDestroy (2010, Ministry of Sound) – Disc 1 of 2\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nBrowsing all articles tagged with The Aston Shuffle\nWon't Get Lost EP (96 Bulls Remix) [Plant Music]"

    "text": "Jack the Radio is an indie roots rock band based in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nIn addition to gaining a strong regional following, the band has had success placing its music on TV shows both nationally and internationally. The band's singer, George Hage, has also been drawn into a Marvel Comic. Additionally, the band's most recent album, Badlands, inspired the creation of a craft beer, Badlands Black Rye IPA, released in October 2015 by the North Carolina–based Mystery Brewing Company.\nJack the Radio was founded by Hage and A.C. Hill in 2005 when they were roommates at North Carolina State University. They wrote songs together in their dorm rooms and recorded a self-titled EP.\nThe band added new members in 2009 and released their first full-length album, Pretty Money, in 2011. The band's second album, Lowcountry, came out in 2012. In 2014, the band won the regional competition known as Last Band Standing.\nIn 2015, Jack the Radio released its third studio album, Badlands. It features special appearances by Elizabeth Hopkins of Delta Rae and BJ Barham of American Aquarium. The online music site The Vinyl District called Badlands \"a powerful mix of swampy, country rock and soaring, indie sensibilities,\" while the regional publication  Indy Week praised it as \"one of the finest big-time rock records to come from the area in recent years.\" In 2023, the band released the song \"This World\" as a tie-in with the I Hate Fairyland graphic novel Gert's Inferno.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nPretty Money (2011)\nLowcountry (2012)\nLive at Amplified Art / Devil in Here (2013)\nBadlands (2015)\nCreatures (2020)\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\"Carolina Mud\" – HBO, Boardwalk Empire, Season 2 recap; USA Networks, Graceland, Season 2 Episode 8\n\"Pretty Money\" – USA Networks, Necessary Roughness, Season 3 Episode 9\n\"Truck Stop Man\" – Discovery Channel, Gator Boys, Season 2 commercial\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\"Downstream\" – Where We're Meant to Be (2016)\n\n\n=== Commercials ===\nFocus Home Interactive – video game trailer (2013)\nSquarespace – 60-second commercial (2013)\nWeber Grill Seasoning – 60-second commercial (2014)\nKraftig Beer – 30-second commercial (2014)\n\n\n=== Comics ===\n\"This World\" – I Hate Fairyland: Gert's Inferno (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJack the Radio"

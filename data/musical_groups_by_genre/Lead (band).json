    "text": "Lead () is a Japanese hip-hop dance and vocal group, initially formed under the name Rhymix in Osaka, Japan in March 2002. They went through two name changes before debuting as \"Lead\" in May 2002 under the Pony Canyon sub-label Flight Master. The group consists of Shinya Taniuichi, Keita Furuya, Akira Kagimoto and, formerly, Hiroki Nakadoi.\nUpon debuting on July 31, 2002 with \"Manatsu no Magic\", the group experienced early success due to their dancing and vocal skills at a young age. The release of their second single \"Show Me the Way\" earned the group the Best Newcomer Award during the 44th Japan Record Awards. Their debut album Life on da Beat took the No. 5 spot on the Oricon charts.\nIn 2010, the group moved from Flight Master to the parent label of Pony Canyon with their single \"Speed Star\".\nBeginning with the single \"Wanna Be With You\" (2012), the group began a string of top-charting singles. The single peaked at No. 3 on Orion and their singles have continued to chart in the top five. Their album The Showcase (2016) became their highest-charting album at No. 2 and their following album Milestone (2018) became their longest-charting album, remaining on the charts for seven weeks.\nIn 2013, leader and lead vocalist Hiroki Nakadoi left the group after feelings of inadequacy. The last single he was featured in was \"Still\", and he officially left the group after their 2012 Upturn tour.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut and formation of Lead ===\nHiroki Nakadoi, Shinya Taniuchi and Akira Kagimoto all attended the CALESS Vocal & Dance School (キャレスボーカル&ダンススクール) in Osaka, Japan, where they met each other and became good friends. By March 2002, they began doing live street performances on the streets of Shiroten at Osaka Castle Park under the dance unit name of \"Rhymix\" (リミックス). By May 2002, they renamed the group from \"Rhymix\" to \"flow\" and began performing by Kyobashi Station. After the name change, the three decided to recruit a fourth member.\nMeanwhile, on April 13, 2002, the Kyushu/Fukuoka Joint Starlight Audition (九州・沖縄合同スターライトオーディション) was being held in Okinawa by Rising Production on a search for new talent. At the time, Keita Furuya and another contestant, Seimi Senoe (瀬上聖未), were declared winners out of the 8,751 hopefuls that auditioned. flow tracked down Keita and he soon joined the group on May 18, 2002.\nOn May 23, 2002, the group underwent another and final name change, officially becoming \"Lead\", whereas they had hoped to become a \"leading group\" of the age.\n\n\n=== 2002–2007: Debut, Life on da Beat and television roles ===\nAround early July 2002, Lead held their first live street performance as four-member group Lead at Osaka Castle Park to demonstrate their skills with dancing, singing and rapping. The event was deemed a success for the group with around 7,000 attendees. Lead also became the opening act for budding group w-inds for their first live tour, 1st Message.\nLead soon released their first single \"Manatsu no Magic\" on July 31, 2002.\nThe release of their second single, \"Show Me the Way\" helped the group take the spot as Best Newcomer Award during the 44th Japan Record Awards, alongside the group Day After Tomorrow and soloists Mika Nakashima and Sachika Shino. In April the following year, they released their debut album, Life on da Beat. It charted at No. 5 on the Oricon Albums Charts, giving the group more success in their early year.\nTheir following single \"Fly Away\" also charted in the top ten at No. 10. Charting for seven weeks, it became, at the time, their longest-running single. \nIn 2003, the group performed the song \"Get Wild Life\". The song would become the theme song for the 2004 film Kamachi, which all of the members would take part in, with Shinya being the titular character. The film was based on the life of Kamachi Yamada, a young savant who rebelled against the Japanese educational system. He created many works, which was come upon by his family after his untimely death in 1977.\nLead was also featured in the 2003 film Boutaoshi!, alongside fellow label-mates Flame and other Pony Canyon artists.

The single failed to break into the top 20 on the Oricon Singles Charts and became their lowest selling single, barely selling 3,000 copies. The single was followed by their first compilation album, Lead Tracks: Listener's Choice. The track list for the album consisted of songs between their 2002 debut with \"Manatsu no Magic\", up until \"Sunnyday\", which was released one week prior at the end of July. The songs for the album were voted on by fans throughout East Asia, including Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. Songs with the highest vote were placed on the album.\nOn August 5, 2009, they released their 16th single \"GiraGira Romantic\".

When Nakadoi finalized his decision, with full support to the others as a group, they chose to stay together due to the constant support of their fans. Before retiring in the entertainment industry, Nakadoi acquired a hairdresser's license and was active as a freelance hairdresser after retirement. He would later open his own salon in 2019.\nIn 2013, they released the singles \"Upturn\" and \"Green Days/Strings\". Both singles peaked in the top five at No. 5 and 4, respectively.

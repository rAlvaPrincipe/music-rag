    "text": "Hikaru Genji (光GENJI（ひかるゲンジ）) was a Japanese pop music idol group named after the character Hikaru Genji of The Tale of Genji. They were managed by Japanese talent agency Johnny & Associates from 1987 to 1995.\n\n\n== History ==\nUntil the appearance of another pop group represented by Johnny & Associates (Hey! Say! 7) in 2007, Hikaru Genji held the record for the youngest male group to top the Oricon singles charts. In 1988, Hikaru Genji became the second artist in history to monopolize the top three spots on the Oricon singles chart and the third artist in history to dominate the top two spots on the charts. They also won the Japan Record Award in the 30th Japan Record Awards for their song \"Paradise Ginga\" that same year, making them the second Johnny's artist to win the award after Masahiko Kondo and the last before Johnny & Associates established a policy that would decline all future nominations of awards from organizations such as the Japan Record Awards and the Japan Academy Awards.\nIn 1994, Mikio Osawa and Hiroyuki Sato left the group and the remaining members formed Hikaru Genji Super 5, which disbanded a year later. Of these five, Kazumi Morohoshi and Junichi Yamamoto have since left the company. Only Atsuhiro Sato and Kohji Uchiumi currently remain with Johnny & Associates as Akira Akasaka was arrested for possession of methamphetamine on October 28, 2007, and was subsequently fired.\n\n\n== Members ==\nHikaru\n\nKohji Uchiumi (内海（うちうみ） 光司（こうじ）, Uchiumi Kōji, born January 11, 1968): Leader\nMikio Osawa (大沢（おおさわ） 樹生（みきお）, Ōsawa Mikio, born April 20, 1969): Vocal\nGenji\n\nKazumi Morohoshi (諸星（もろほし） 和己（かずみ）, Morohoshi Kazumi, born August 12, 1970): Center\nHiroyuki Sato (佐藤（さとう） 寛之（ひろゆき）, Satō Hiroyuki, born November 2, 1970): Vocal\nJunichi Yamamoto (山本（やまもと） 淳一（じゅんいち）, Yamamoto Jun'ichi, born February 28, 1972): Main Vocal\nAkira Akasaka (赤坂（あかさか） 晃（あきら）, Akasaka Akira, born May 8, 1973): Vocal\nAtsuhiro Sato (佐藤（さとう） 敦啓（あつひろ）, Satō Atsuhiro, born August 30, 1973): Vocal\n\n\n== Hikaru Genji Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Star Light\"\n\"Glass no Jūdai\" (ガラスの十代)\n\"Paradise Ginga\" (パラダイス銀河)\n\"Diamond Hurricane\" (Diamond（ダイヤモンド）ハリケーン)\n\"Tsurugi no Mai\" (剣の舞)\n\"Chikyū wo Sagashite\" (地球をさがして)\n\"Taiyō ga Ippai\" (太陽がいっぱい)\n\"Kōya no Megalopolis\" (荒野のメガロポリス)\n\"Little Birthday\"\n\"Co Co Ro\"\n\"Waratte Yo\" (笑ってよ)\n\"Kaze no Naka no Shonen\" (風の中の少年)\n\"Kiseki no Megami\" (奇跡の女神)\n\"Winning Run\"\n\"Growing Up\"\n\"Take Off\"\n\"Lila no Saku koro Barcelona\" (リラの咲くころバルセロナへ)\n\"Meet Me\"\n\"Ai Shite mo ii Desu Ka\" (愛してもいいですか)\n\"Kimi to Subayaku Slowly\" (君とすばやくSLOWLY)\n\"Yūki 100%\" (勇気100%, Courage 100%)\n\"Boys in August\"\n\"Kono Aki...

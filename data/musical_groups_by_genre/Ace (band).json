    "text": "Ace were a British rock band who enjoyed moderate success in the 1970s. Their membership included Paul Carrack, who later became famous as a vocalist for Mike + The Mechanics and as a solo artist. Ace were perhaps best known for their hit single \"How Long\", which was a top 20 single in the United Kingdom in 1974, and reached no. 3 in the United States and Canada in 1975.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe band formed in December 1972 in Sheffield as \"Ace Flash and the Dynamos\", but soon shortened the name to \"Ace\". The members were assembled from various professional bands. Carrack and Terry Comer had previously played with Warm Dust, and Alan \"Bam\" King with Mighty Baby and before that the 1960s band The Action. Fusing elements of pop and funk, Ace achieved popularity on the pub rock circuit. \nBefore the recording of their debut album, Five-A-Side, the former drummer of Bees Make Honey, Fran Byrne, replaced Steve Witherington. The single \"How Long\" was taken from this record, and was a significant chart success, achieving a top 20 place in the UK Singles Chart, and reaching number three in the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in the spring of 1975. The Five-A-Side album did well on its own too, peaking at number 11 on the Billboard 200. Carrack, the band's keyboardist and chief songwriter, sang lead on \"How Long\", while follow-up singles were sung by other band members.\nAce eventually moved to the United States, replacing Phil Harris with Jon Woodhead in June 1976, and releasing their third and final album No Strings in January 1977. Unlike earlier Ace LPs, the latter featured Carrack's vocals, with Carrack singing lead on the two singles issued from the album. The singles didn't chart and Ace disbanded in July 1977, when Carrack, Comer and Byrne all joined Frankie Miller's backing band.\nIn addition to his solo career, Carrack has since played with Eric Clapton, Nick Lowe, Roger Waters and his The Bleeding Heart Band, Roxy Music for the Manifesto album and tour, Squeeze in the early 1980s, and Mike + The Mechanics, for which he is best known. His solo re-recording of \"How Long\" became a UK top 40 hit again in 1996.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPaul Carrack (born 22 April 1951, Sheffield, Yorkshire) – keyboards, vocals (1972–1977)\nAlan \"Bam\" King (born 18 September 1946, Kentish Town, London) – rhythm guitar, vocals (1972–1977)\nTerry \"Tex\" Comer (born 23 February 1949, Burnley, Lancashire) – bass (1972–1977)\nPhil Harris (born Philip Harris, 18 July 1948, Muswell Hill, London) – lead guitar, vocals (1972–1976)\nSteve Witherington (born 26 December 1953, Enfield, Middlesex) – drums (1972–1974)\nFran Byrne (born 17 March 1948, Dublin, Ireland) – drums (1974–1977)\nJon Woodhead – lead guitar, vocals (1976–1977)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nSix-A-Side (1982)\nHow Long: The Best of Ace (1987)\nThe Very Best of Ace (1993)\nThe Best of Ace (Varèse, 2003)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of 1970s one-hit wonders in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPeel Sessions – 25 March 1975\nAce discography at Discogs\nAce at IMDb"

Hailing from Chicago, Bint's music has been described as \"gently wistful, dust-kicking psychedelia\" and \"dreamy heart warming folk\" with \"simple, heartfelt melodies\". One Little Plane's debut album, Until (2008), featured production from Kieran Hebden. Hebden also produced the follow-up, Into the Trees (2012).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nUntil (2008)\nInto the Trees (2012)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"She Was Out in the Water\" (2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOne Little Plane on Myspace"

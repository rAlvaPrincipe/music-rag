    "text": "Out of the Blue, also known as OTB, was an American jazz ensemble founded by Blue Note Records in the 1980s as a showcase for the label's younger musicians. The group was formed in 1984, releasing four albums and touring extensively over the next five years. Their most commercially successful album was 1986's Live at Mt. Fuji, which reached #9 on Billboard magazine's Top Jazz Albums chart. The lineup changed occasionally over this time, and the group disbanded in 1989 after its members moved on to solo careers.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMichael Philip Mossman - trumpet\nKenny Garrett - alto saxophone\nRalph Bowen - tenor saxophone\nHarry Pickens - piano\nRobert Hurst - bass\nRalph Peterson, Jr. - drums\nKenny Davis - bass\nSteve Wilson - alto saxophone\nRenee Rosnes - piano\nBilly Drummond - drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nOut of the Blue (Blue Note, 1985)\nInside Track (Blue Note, 1986)\nLive at Mt.

    "text": "Love You to Death (formerly: The Pettit Project) was a pop punk band from Toronto, Ontario, Canada formed in 1999, signed to Affluence Music Group.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Pettit Project was featured on the Drive-Thru Records stage of the Vans Warped Tour in 2002. They've played with several established bands over the years, including Fefe Dobson, similar-sounding pop group Hellogoodbye, and appeared on a mini-tour with Hedley (band) in 2006.\nThe Pettit Project was featured in season 2, episode 4 of the Canadian television series Radio Free Roscoe, \"These Bossy Boots are Made for Walking\", in 2004, where Lily, played by Kate Todd, attempts to arrange an interview with the band for RFR. An interview is arranged over the phone with Scott Komer, however it doesn't go well. Komer begins to express his frustration for having to always answer the same questions, so Ray decides to take control in an attempt to save the interview. Ray then visits Mickey's where The Pettit Project is preparing for their live set; He explains to the band how he's trying to make amends with his friend. The Pettit Project then performs their song \"99 Lives\" at the school dance, followed by a cover of Lily's song \"Don't Tell Me What To Do\", repairing Lily and Ray's friendship.\nThe Pettit Project became a major player on the web with over 119,000 plays on MySpace; 150,000 plays on MP3.com; and 240,500 plays on PureVolume.\nThey became Love You to Death, in February 2008, as a response to their frustration with people being unable to accurately pronounce or spell their band name. An example of this would be \"Petite Project\".\nLove You to Death opened for Silverstein (band) at the El Mocambo, in April 2010, for the Decade (Live at the El Mocambo) show.\nWith fifteen releases over the past sixteen years, their members have included musicians that went on to be in Avril Lavigne’s band, Not By Choice and Boys Night Out.\nLove You to Death announced they were breaking up in November 2015 after releasing their final EP \"Our Final Release 'Cause Paul's Dead\".\nThe Pettit Project reunited in July 2014 with Scott Komer and former band members: Alison \"the ton\" Morris and Boys Night Out lead vocalist Connor Lovat-Fraser to record their live-off-the-floor album, \"The Secret Diary of Allan's Kid\", with the help of drummer Sam Guaiana and bassist Paul Shields. The album was released in August 2016 and features songs from the band's early years.\nScott Komer and Sam Guaiana have reunited with former Pettit Project member Bob Anderson to form the Toronto-based punk band Terror Ruins Birthdays.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Secret Diary of Allan's Kid (2016)\n(As 'The Pettit Project')\n\n\"As Soon As We're Back Home\"\n\"You're Champagne, and I'm Shiznit\"\n\"I'll Bury You at Makeout Creek\"\n\"Used (To Being Alone)\"\n\"Even If You Don't\"\n\"Katie\"\n\"Simple Song, Simple Plan\"\n\"Bury Me at Makeout Creek\"\n\"Scott And Connor Are Both Dorks\"\n\"When Scott Got Dumped\"\n\"Guess I Gotta Guess\"\n\"Oh, I'll Get Her Alright\"\nIf You Want to Make God LOL, Text Him Your Plans (2013)\n\"Beacon, Lighthouse, Marco Polo\"\n\"Throwdown!\"\n\"Jack and Jager\"\n\"Kickin' Ass and Rippin' Throats\"\n\"Finishing Moves (ft.

    "text": "Club Dogo is an Italian rap group from Milan that consists of Gué Pequeno and Jake La Furia, and beatmaker Don Joe.\nThe group grew out of the friendship between rappers Gué Pequeno (whose stage name was Lucky Luciano) and Dargen D'Amico in 1999. Originally the group's name was \"Sacre Scuole\" and its members were the two aforementioned rappers and Jake La Furia, whose stage name was originally Fame.\nIn 2001, after their first and only CD (3 MC's al Cubo), the group was disbanded due to quarrels between Jake and Dargen.\nIn 2005, Club Dogo formed the crew named Dogo Gang, including other MCs and DJs from Milan that gradually joined the collective.\nClub Dogo stopped producing music together in 2014, although none of the three members ever stated the group was officially disbanded. Club Dogo announced their return on stage as a group through a video published on their social media on 20 October 2023. The video featured Milan's mayor Giuseppe Sala.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nAs Sacre Scuole\n\nAs Club Dogo\n\nAs Dogo Gang\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Other projects ===\n2005: Don Joe & Grand Agent – Regular (EP)\n2005: Guè Pequeno & Deleterio – Hashishinz Sound Vol. 1 (EP)\n2005: Marracash & Dogo Gang – Roccia Music Vol. 1 (mixtape)\n2006: DJ Harsh & Guè Pequeno – Fast Life Vol. 1 (mixtape)\n2009: DJ Harsh & Guè Pequeno – Fast Life Vol. 2 (mixtape)\n2012: DJ Harsh & Guè Pequeno – Fast Life Vol. 3 (mixtape)\n2011: Don Joe & Shablo – Thori & Rocce\n2011: Guè Pequeno – Il Ragazzo d'Oro\n2013: Guè Pequeno – Bravo Ragazzo\n2013: Jake La Furia – Musica Commerciale\n2015: Guè Pequeno – Vero\n2016: Jake La Furia – Fuori Da Qui\n2017: Gué Pequeno – Gentleman\n2018: Gué Pequeno – Sinatra\n2019: Gué Pequeno – Gelida Estate (EP)\n2020: Gué Pequeno – Mr. Fini\n2020: with Emis Killa – 17 (Album)\n2021: Gué Pequeno – Fast Life Vol.4\n2022: Gué Pequeno – GVESVS\n2022: Jake La Furia – Ferro del mestiere\n2023: Gué – Madreperla\n\n\n== See also ==\nItalian hip hop\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site\nOfficial Myspace"

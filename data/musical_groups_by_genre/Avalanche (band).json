From the late 1980s and during the 1990s the couple lived and worked in Germany and France. They currently live in Aurskog-Høland, Norway with their two children.\nKjetil Røsnes is owner of Planet Orange Production, a music production company based in Aurskog.\nIn 1989 the duo had their biggest hit with the song \"Johnny, Johnny Come Home,\" written one year earlier, in France, where it was the number-one single for eight weeks (sold ~700,000). It was also successful in their home country of Norway.\nKjetil Røsnes and Kirsti Johansen wrote \"Santa Maria\" a successful song both for Dutch singer Tatjana and singer Samantha Fox.\nThey later launched a side-project called K + K.\nIn 2007 the Blue Moon Band participated in Melodi Grand Prix (MGP) with \"Goodbye to yesterday\", written by Kjetil + Kirsti.\nA year later Avalanche were in MGP with the song \"Two Monkeys (On The Roof)\". The song was written in 1997 when the couple lived near Cannes, France. However, they could not be at the MGP 2008 together because Kirsti was ill.

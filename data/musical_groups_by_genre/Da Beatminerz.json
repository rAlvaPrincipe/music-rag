    "text": "Da Beatminerz are an American hip-hop production crew from Bushwick, Brooklyn, known for their dark, gritty sound that is very popular with the underground hip-hop scene.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe crew, originally composed of brothers Mr. Walt (born June 2, 1968) and DJ Evil Dee (born May 24, 1971), formed in 1992, making their production debut with Evil Dee's group Black Moon, on its debut single, \"Who Got Da Props?\" The duo produced the entirety of Black Moon's acclaimed debut album, Enta Da Stage, in 1993, then continued production work with Black Moon's Buckshot and his crew Boot Camp Clik. In 1995, along with its third official member, Baby Paul, the group produced the entirety of Smif-N-Wessun's debut album, Dah Shinin'. It continued work with fellow Boot Camp members Heltah Skeltah and O.G.C. in 1996, contributing multiple beats for their respective debuts, Nocturnal and Da Storm. In the late 1990s, da Beatminerz expanded its client list, producing popular hip hop artists such as Afu-Ra, Black Star, Eminem, Flipmode Squad, M.O.P., De La Soul, Mic Geronimo, and O.C.\nAlso in 1996, they appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD, America is Dying Slowly, alongside Biz Markie, Wu-Tang Clan, and Fat Joe, among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as \"a masterpiece\" by The Source magazine. \nBy 2001, the crew expanded to five members, with producers Rich Blak and Chocolate Ty joining Baby Paul, Evil Dee, and Mr. Walt. That year, the group released its debut album, Brace 4 Impak, on popular independent label Rawkus Records, featuring guest appearances from Royce Da 5'9\", Black Moon, Ras Kass, Diamond D, Cocoa Brovaz, Pete Rock, Talib Kweli, Freddie Foxxx, Jean Grae, and Naughty by Nature. The album's lead single, \"Take That,\" became a hip hop hit in 2001, hitting the Top 5 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. By 2004, the crew narrowed back to its original members, Evil Dee and Mr. Walt, and the duo released its second album, Fully Loaded w/ Statik, on Copter Records. In the new millennium, the group has crafted beats for artists such as Akrobatik, Big Daddy Kane, Black Moon, Boot Camp Clik, Craig G, Dilated Peoples, Jean Grae, KRS-One, Naughty By Nature, Smif-N-Wessun, and Wordsworth. Currently, Da Beatminerz are running their own internet radio station.

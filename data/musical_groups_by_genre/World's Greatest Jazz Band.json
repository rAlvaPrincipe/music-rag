    "text": "The World's Greatest Jazz Band was an all-star jazz ensemble active from 1968 to 1978.\nDick Gibson founded the group at his sixth Jazz Party, an annual event. The group performed mostly Dixieland jazz and recorded extensively. It was co-led by Yank Lawson and Bob Haggart, and did early jazz standards alongside contemporaneous pop songs done in a Dixieland style. Though the group disbanded in 1978, the name was revived several times by Lawson and Haggart for limited engagements.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\nExtra!

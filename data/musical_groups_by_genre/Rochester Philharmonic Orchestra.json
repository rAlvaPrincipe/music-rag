Its primary concert venue is the Eastman Theatre at the Eastman School of Music.\n\n\n== History ==\nGeorge Eastman, founder of Eastman Kodak Company, founded the orchestra in 1922, with Eugene Goossens and Albert Coates as the first principal conductors of the orchestra, in a joint appointment.  Other past music directors of the orchestra included Erich Leinsdorf, who made several recordings with the orchestra that increased its profile.  From 1939 through 1964, the Rochester Philharmonic, usually supplemented by faculty members of the Eastman School, often recorded under the names Eastman-Rochester Orchestra under the direction of Howard Hanson and Eastman-Rochester Pops under Frederick Fennell.\n\nFrom 1990 through 2008, the RPO had its summer residency at the Bravo! Vail Valley Music Festival, in Vail, Colorado.\nIn September 2010, the RPO named Arild Remmereit as its 11th music director, effective September 2011. In November 2012, the RPO board voted to terminate Remmereit's contract two years early,  Remmereit stood down as music director after the 2012–2013 season. September 1, 2014 Ward Stare became the music director. He stepped down from the position at the close of the 2020–2021 season.\nIn 1994, Andreas Delfs first guest-conducted the orchestra.  In January 2021, the orchestra named Delfs its next music director.\nThe RPO sponsors the Rochester Philharmonic Youth Orchestra (RPYO), founded in 1970 and composed of Rochester-area student musicians in the eighth through twelfth grades. Under the direction of James Mick, the RPYO performs three concerts annually, including one side by side with the RPO. Members of the RPO serve as mentors for the Youth Orchestra.  In 2000, the orchestra named Michael Butterman its principal conductor for education and outreach, the first position of its kind in the country.  Jherrard Hardeman was appointed in 2023 as the RPYO Music Director.\nJeff Tyzik has served as the orchestra's principal pops conductor since 1994.

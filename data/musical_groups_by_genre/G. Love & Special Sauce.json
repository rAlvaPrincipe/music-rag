    "text": "G. Love & Special Sauce is an American rock band from Philadelphia. They are known for their unique, \"sloppy\", and \"laid back\" sound that encompasses blues, hip hop, rock, and soul. The band features Garrett Dutton, better known as G. Love; Jeffrey Clemens on drums; and Jim Prescott on bass.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band formed in January 1993, when Dutton was performing at a Boston bar, The Tam O'Shanter. There he met drummer Jeffrey Clemens. Dutton and Clemens began working as a duo, and were joined a few months later by bassist Jim Prescott, and became the house band at The Plough and Stars in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1994, they released their self-titled debut album on Okeh Records. On the strength of the single \"Cold Beverage\", due in part to the song's rotation on MTV, the album nearly went gold. Trying to capitalize on the success of the album, the group subsequently toured heavily, eventually landing a spot on the H.O.R.D.E. tour.\nIn 1995, they released their follow-up album Coast to Coast Motel. Although it did not sell as well as the first album, it is considered by many critics as the stronger of the two. On tour following the release of the second album, the group nearly broke up, due to disagreements about the group's finances. Deciding on a hiatus the three members went their separate ways, working on various side projects.\n\nBy October 1997, the group had reconciled their differences and released their third album, Yeah, It's That Easy, which along with their own work, showcased their collaboration with several other bands and musicians, including All Fellas Band, Philly Cartel, King's Court, and Dr. John. This soul-influenced album was more similar to their debut album than their previous release.\nSoon after G. Love & Special Sauce set out on another world tour, returning to Philadelphia in 1999 for the release of their fourth album, Philadelphonic. Philadelphonic was followed up with Electric Mile in 2001, an album that shows the wide-ranging influences of the trio, incorporating hip-hop, funk, psychedelica, blues, and soul in equal and ambitious measure. Ever the road band, Mile was followed by extensive touring. During this time they performed as the house band for Comedy Central's show Turn Ben Stein On, which ran from 1999–2001.\n\nIn summer 2005, the band featured in an advertisement for the launch of Coca-Cola Zero, featuring the group's own unique version of the noted Coca-Cola advertising song \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\". On June 24, 2008, Superhero Brother was released. On January 15, 2009, G. Love announced on the band's website that bassist Jimi \"Jazz\" Prescott is no longer a member of the band. On January 21, 2014, G. Love posted a release containing the announcement of the album Sugar, and stating that Jimi Prescott had returned to the band.  In 2014 Cadillac released a commercial featuring \"Come Up Man\".\n\n\n=== Solo albums ===\nG. Love has released four solo albums. His first, The Hustle, was the first G. Love release under Jack Johnson's Brushfire Records banner. Johnson had been a guest on the Special Sauce album Philadelphonic. G. Love performed a series of shows in 2004 with Jack Johnson and fellow Brushfire Records artist Donavon Frankenreiter, and the trio also found time to issue a live EP.

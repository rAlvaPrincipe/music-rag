    "text": "A Fragile Tomorrow is an American alternative/powerpop band from Charleston, South Carolina, United States, formerly from Montgomery, New York. The group formed in 2003 and included brothers Sean Kelly, Dom Kelly, and Brendan Kelly. In 2006, bassist Shaun Rhoades joined the group. The band has put out six studio albums, most recently the critically acclaimed  Make Me Over in 2015 and Generation Loss in 2019. As of 2020, they were working on their seventh record and third MPress Records release. The band has shared the stage with/opened for Indigo Girls, The Bangles, Matthew Sweet, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Garrison Starr, Antigone Rising, K's Choice, Drivin N Cryin, Continental Drifters, Blues Traveler, The Cowsills, Danielle Howle, Susan Cowsill, Amy Ray, and more.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nThe band was first formed by brothers Sean, Dominic, and Brendan Kelly. Sean and Dominic are two of triplets, all diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy as infants, and their fraternal triplet died when they were 6. After first becoming a band in 2003, three years later, they had enough material for an  album, which led to their 2006 debut. Soon after the release, bassist Shaun Rhoades was added to the group. After ending their recording/management contract with Audem Records in early 2007, the band began work on their sophomore release Beautiful Noise, which was released independently in 2008. Touring in support of this release led to the band deciding to relocate from their hometown of Montgomery, NY to Charleston, SC.\nThe band began recording the follow-up to 2008's Beautiful Noise, titled Tripping Over Nothing, which was produced by South Carolina musician Danielle Howle in the summer of 2009. The album features guest appearances once again by Peter Holsapple and Susan Cowsill, as well as Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls. Consistent touring in Charleston, coupled with time spent in the area recording their third album, prompted the band to relocate to the Charleston area in late 2009, where they have since remained.\nThe album was released on February 23, 2010.

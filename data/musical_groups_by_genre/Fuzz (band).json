    "text": "Fuzz is a rock band from San Francisco, California, United States, formed in 2011. The band consists of Charles Moothart (vocals, guitar), Ty Segall (vocals, drums) and Chad Ubovich (vocals, bass guitar).\nCreated as an outlet for Moothart's affection for hard rock riffs, Fuzz began as collaboration between Moothart and Segall, while Moothart performed in Segall's live band. In 2012, they released two singles, \"This Time I Got a Reason\" and \"Sleigh Ride\", and were joined by the bass guitarist Roland Cosio.\nIn October 2013, the band released its first album, Fuzz. While touring the album, Ubovich (Meatbodies and Mikal Cronin Band) replaced Cosio on bass guitar. In October 2015, Fuzz released a second album, entitled II, written in a more collaborative manner than the band members were used to. In October 2020, a third album, entitled III, was released.\n\n\n== History ==\nRegarding the band's origins, vocalist and guitarist Moothart noted that the project began at his home. \"I was sitting in my house one day, before I was in Ty's band or anything, wondering how hard it would be to write a hard rock song. I was trying to figure out if it'd be ridiculous, or sound like shit. I just tried and then eventually showed the stuff to Ty. He was stoked on it and then we tried to jam together. It was really more to have fun. He mentioned playing drums. We wanted to play music like that, just to see if it was possible.\"\nThe band's first album was released in 2013.\nWhen joining the band, the bass guitarist Ubovich noted that the writing process for II differed from previous collaborations and projects with one another. \"We all kind of did something we’ve never done before, which was write together as a band. That was a first for all of us. Usually in our respective projects it’s all about writing on our own, and that process. This time we tried something definitely new.\" Still in Rock tied the album with Mac Demarco's Another One for the third best album of 2015.\nIn July 2020, \"Returning\", the first song from the band's third album was released. The album, entitled III, was released on 23 October 2020.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nFuzz (2013)\nII (2015)\nIII (2020)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nLevitation Sessions (2021, The Reverberation Appreciation Society)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n\"This Time I Got A Reason\"/\"Fuzz's Fourth Dream\" – 7\" (2012, Trouble In Mind)\n\"Sleigh Ride/You Won't See Me\" – 7\" (2013, In the Red)\nLive in San Francisco EP – 12\" (2013, Castle Face Records)\n\"Sunderberry Dream\"/\"21st Century Schizoid Man\" – 7\" (2013, In the Red)\n\"Till the End of the Day\" (Kinks cover) – 7\" (2014, Famous Class)\n\n\n== References =="

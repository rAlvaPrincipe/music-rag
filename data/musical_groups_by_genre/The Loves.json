    "text": "The Loves were a heavily 1960s influenced pop band, formed in 2000 in Cardiff, Wales. Their debut album Love was released on Track and Field Records in 2004, but attracted generally hostile press coverage, and was commercially unsuccessful. Recorded mostly by Simon Love alone, their second album Technicolour was released in 2007 on Fortuna Pop. The band recorded four Peel sessions between 2001 and 2002: three in Maida Vale and one at Peel Acres (on Valentine's Day 2002).\nTheir third album, Three, (also released on Fortuna Pop) featured guest appearances from Rob Jones aka The Voluntary Butler Scheme, Delia Sparrow, Hefner's Darren Hayman and Harry Hill's TV Burp writer Daniel Maier. The Loves fourth and final album, ...Love You, was released on Fortuna Pop in 2010. It features The Velvet Underground's Doug Yule as the voice of Jesus. \"Bubblegum\" and \"December Boy\" were the double A sided single taken from the album in July 2010.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nAll are 7\" vinyl unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\"Little Girl Blues\" / \"She'll Break Your Heart\" CD (Boobytrap, 2001)\n\"Boom-a-Bang-Bang-Bang\" (Track and Field, 2001)\n\"Just Like Bobby D\" (Track and Field, 2002)\n\"Shake Your Bones\" (Track and Field, 2003)\n\"Xs and Os\" / \"She'll Break Your Heart...Again\" (Fortuna Pop!, 2006)\n\"One-Two-Three\" (Fortuna Pop!, 2007)\n\"The Ex-Gurlfriend\" (Fortuna Pop!, 2009)\n\"December Boy\" / \"Bubblegum\" (Fortuna Pop!, 2010)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nLove (Track and Field, 2004)\nTechnicolour (Fortuna Pop!, 2007)\nThree (Fortuna Pop!, 2009)\n...Love You (Fortuna Pop!, 2010)\nClench (Due 2014, since cancelled)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nA Very Fortuna Christmas Vol 2 (Fortuna Pop, 2002, contains a cover of John Lennon's \"Cold Turkey\")\nPow!

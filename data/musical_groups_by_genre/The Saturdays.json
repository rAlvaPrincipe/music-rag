The lineup consists of Frankie Bridge, Una Healy, Rochelle Humes, Mollie King, and Vanessa White. They were formed through Fascination Records, a sub-division of Polydor Records, which gave them an instant record deal with the label. As soon as the contract was finalized, the Saturdays went on tour with Girls Aloud during their Tangled Up Tour. The group's music style is pop, but throughout their career, their management has experimented with dance-pop and electropop. Songwriters and producers Ina Wroldsen, Steve Mac, Camille Purcell, and Quiz & Larossi have helped create their music. In July 2008, The Saturdays released their debut single and first Top Ten hit, \"If This Is Love\". Their debut album, Chasing Lights, released the same year, charted at number nine on the UK Albums Chart; it was certified platinum by the BPI and produced three more top ten singles: \"Up\", \"Issues\", and \"Just Can't Get Enough\". \"Work\" was also released from the album.

In 2010, the Saturdays released a mini album, Headlines!, which contained the top 10 hits \"Missing You\" and \"Higher\", the latter of which featured guest vocals from Flo Rida.

No drums were ever put down.\" Headlines! was released in 2010, which was the band's first Extended play on the EP, the band have made use of auto-tuning on their vocals, most notable on \"Missing You\" and \"Higher\" They said about the music on Headlines! \"We finished [Wordshaker] and we'd come across some songs that we were really excited about.

They said; \"I think every artist needs to, sort of, reinvent themselves and we don't want any track to sound like it could have been on our previous albums. It's going to be a step up from the last album but we'll keep it The Saturdays-esque.\" The band described the song's lyrics as \"playful\" with a \"drop-out chorus\" and the song is often labelled \"it's a very cool\" by the band.

    "text": "The Harlem Blues and Jazz Band is a  jazz ensemble active since the 1970s.\nThe band was initiated by Al Vollmer in 1973, noting that a significant pool of jazz musicians who had played in the 1920s and 1930s lived in New York City and had retired as musicians. Its first bandleader was Clyde Bernhardt, who was replaced in 1980 by Bobby Williams. The band is touring in the US and in Europe since 1976 and has edited several LPs and CDs.

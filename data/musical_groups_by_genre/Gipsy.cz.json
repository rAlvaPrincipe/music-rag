    "text": "Gipsy.cz is a Czech Romani hip hop group. They performed at the Glastonbury Festival in 2007 and represented their country at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, with the song \"Aven Romale\". The band plays a combination of hip hop and traditional Romani music, sung primarily in the Romani language, with some lyrics in Czech and English. As of 2013, they have released four studio albums.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings; Romano Hip Hop: 2004–2008 ===\nIn 2004, rapper Radovan \"Radek\" Banga released the solo album Ya favourite Cd Rom and later met violinist Vojta Lavička and brothers Jan (upright bass) and Petr Surmaj (guitar and accordion), with whom he formed the group Gipsy.cz. They rose to fame in 2006 with the single \"Romano Hip Hop\", from the album of the same name, which reached the MTV World Chart Express and was later certified Gold in the Czech Republic. Also in 2006, the band won Discovery of the Year at the Anděl Awards.\nIn 2007, they took part in the Czech preliminary round for the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Muloland\", but only reached second place. Later that year, Gipsy.cz was the first Czech group to perform at the Glastonbury Festival. Additionally, their song \"Jednou\" was included on the Gypsy Groove compilation album published by Putumayo in 2007.\nAt the 2008 Český slavík, they won the Rising Star of the Year award.\n\n\n=== Reprezent, Desperado, Upgrade: 2008–2013 ===\nIn June 2008, Gipsy.cz released their second studio album, Reprezent. It reached second place on the World Music Chart in Europe, remaining there for four weeks. The song \"A na závěr si s námi dejte trochu té Čunárny\" stimulated discussion, as the title and lyrics mocked politician Jiří Čunek, who is known for his anti-Roma comments. In order to avoid a possible lawsuit, Gipsy.cz eventually released an alternate version of the song, without the offending lyrics.\nThe band took part in the Czech preliminary round for the Eurovision Song Contest in 2008, but again failed to qualify.\nJan and Petr Surmaj left Gipsy.cz in January 2009, and after filling out the vacant musical seats, the band finally succeeded in their repeated attempts to represent the Czech Republic at the Eurovision Song Contest in Moscow, Russia, with their song \"Aven Romale\". They finished last in the first semi-final, without receiving a single point.\nIn February and March 2011, Gipsy.cz toured Australia as part of the Karavan Festival. In April of the same year, their third studio album, Desperado, was released. Two years later, the band issued their fourth record, Upgrade.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\nCurrent\n\nRadoslav Banga aka Gipsy – vocals\nTomáš Baroš – electric upright bass\nJan Sochor – accordion\nViliam Didiáš – violin\nPast\n\nVojta Lavička – violin, vocals\nNoemi Fialová – violin, vocals\nTibor Žida – guitar, vocals\nMatěj Černý – bass\nOliver Lipenský – drums\nPetr Surmaj – guitar, accordion\nJan Surmaj – electric upright bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\nRomano Hip Hop (2006)\nReprezent (2008)\nDesperado (2011)\nUpgrade (2013)\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2005 Anděl Awards\nBest Hip Hop Album nomination\n2006 Anděl Awards\nBest Album in the World nomination\nBest New Artist nomination (won)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nGipsy.cz on Indies Scope\nDocumentary about Gipsy.cz on Czech Television"

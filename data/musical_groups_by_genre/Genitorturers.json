    "text": "The Genitorturers are an American industrial metal band with influences extending into the 1990s hardcore punk and electronic music. They proclaim themselves to be \"The World's Sexiest Rock Band\".\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginating in Orlando, Florida, the band was founded by lead singer Jennifer \"Gen\" Zimmerman while attending Rollins college.  Originally called The Festering Genitorturers, the band consisted of Marisa (vocals), Yvonne (guitar), Gen (bass), Larry (guitar) and Mike (drums).  Their first performance was at the Ocean Club in Cocoa Beach, Florida, in late 1986.  Also on the bill was Declared Ungovernable, Belching Penguins, and The Rhythm Pigs.  Shortening their name to The Genitorturers, the band underwent various personnel changes and progressed in the 1990s Florida \"hardcore\" music scene, with contemporary bands such as Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids, who also became a success in later years.  According to the band's official biography, \"What emerged would be a band that would go beyond shaking up the house that 'Mickey' built and extend to paving the way and breaking ground for performance based music artists thereafter worldwide\".\nIn 1993, IRS Records owner Miles Copeland III sent his assistant Nick Turner (former drummer for The Lords of the New Church) to see the band perform. The quality of the performance, as well as their musical style containing fused elements of hardcore punk, metal and industrial electronics, led them to a record contract. Soon after that, they recorded 120 Days of Genitorture.  After recording this album, Morbid Angel bassist/vocalist David Vincent (Gen's husband) joined the Genitorturers on bass. He left Morbid Angel in 1995, after the album Domination, to join his wife's band.\nThe band has extensively toured the United States, Japan, and Europe, and is internationally renowned for its exploits and erotic show content.\nBy the time of their second album Sin City in 1998, Genitorturers had gained a notable reputation with their flamboyant BDSM-themed shows resulting in the band appearing in various television features in the USA; including VH1, Fox News, Hard Copy, HBO's Real Sex and Playboy TV's Sexcetera.\nThe Flesh is the Law EP includes the track \"Lecher Bitch\", which was also included in the November 2004 video game Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines. Earlier releases included Machine Love, which contains a cover of Divinyls' hit \"I Touch Myself\", which was produced by Dave Ogilvie and Rob Zombie producer Scott Humphrey.\nIn 2004, Genitorturers featured in a 12-page spread in the monthly pornographic publication Hustler, the magazine's only multi-page spread with a rock band.  Hustler described Genitorturers as \"the world's sexiest band\".\nIn 2006, they toured Australia with Dead Inside the Chrysalis.\nThe band's last album, Blackheart Revolution, was released in 2009.  In 2014, Genitorturers celebrated over 20 years since the release of their debut album by going on tour, '20 Years of Depravity'. On Halloween 2020, during a livestream, Genitorturers debuted their first song in 11 years \"Scars & Stripes Forever\".\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nGen – lead vocals (1986–present)\nEric Griffin – guitars, backing vocals (2009–present)\nKriz D.K. – drums (2011–present)\nAbbey Nex – bass, backing vocals (2004–2009, 2022–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nGuitars\nYvonne Lievano – guitars (1986–1989)\nScott Beckey – guitars (1989–1991)\nJerry Ôutlaw – guitars (1991–1994)\nChuck \"Chains\" Lenihan – guitars (1995–2002)\nBizz – guitars (2003–2009)\nBass\nPaweł Mąciwoda – bass (1990)\nDavid \"Evil D\" Vincent – bass, backing vocals (1990–1992, 1994–2004)\nSean Colpoys – bass (1992–1994)\nRyan Seelbach – bass, backing vocals (2009–2022)\nDrums\nAW Reckart – drums (1991–1993)\nHoward 'H-Bomb' Broadnax – drums (1993–1997)\nRacci Shay – drums (1997–2001)\nAngel Bartolotta – drums (2001–2005, 2006–2009)\nJoe Letz – drums (2005–2006)\nSean Davidson – drums (2009–2011)\nKeyboards\nJames Creer – keyboards (1994–1995)\nVinnie Saletto – keyboards (1995–1999)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n120 Days of Genitorture (1993)\nSin City (1998)\nBlackheart Revolution (2009)\nRemix albums\nMachine Love (2000)\nExtended plays\nFlesh Is the Law (2002)\nTouch Myself EP (2009)\nVideos\nSociety of Genitorture (VHS) (1997)\nThe Society of Genitorture (DVD) (2001)\nLive in Sin (DVD) (2007)\nMovie soundtrack appearances\nThe Society of Genitorture (1997)\nRaging Hormones (1999)\nBike Week Exposed (2003)\nVampire Clan (2002)\nVideo game soundtrack appearances\nTrue Crime: Streets of LA (2004)\nVampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines (2004)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nGenitorturers at AllMusic\nGenitorturers discography at Discogs"

    "text": "L'Impératrice (French pronunciation: [lɛ̃peʁatʁis]; \"The Empress\") is a French pop and nu-disco band formed in 2012 in Paris. The group was founded by Charles de Boisseguin (keyboardist) and at first included Hagni Gwon (keyboards), David Gaugué (bass guitar), Achille Trocellier (electric guitar) and Tom Daveau (drums). Flore Benguigui (vocals) joined the band in 2015 and left in 2024. She was replaced by Louve.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nL'Impératrice released their first, self-titled EP in 2012, followed by a second (Sonate Pacifique) in 2014, and then a third (Odyssée) in 2015. The latter was re-edited a year later under the name L'Empereur, in a slower version of the original, inspired by a fan's mistake of playing the album at the wrong speed. An acoustic version using violin, cello and acoustic guitar was also released, in February 2017. \nThe band received the Deezer Adami Fans' award in 2016.\nIn 2016, a single, \"Vanille Fraise,\" was released, based on a sample by the soul singer Anita Ward.\nThe band then joined the independent label microqlima, releasing an EP title, Séquences, in June 2017. Remixes of its songs, one by the Australian group Parcels, were released that September.\nOn 17 October 2017, the band released \"Erreur 404\", the first single off their first full-length album, Matahari.  L'impératrice appeared on the French television show Quotidien on TMC on 9 January 2018.\nThe band performed at La Cigale on 12 October 2017, and then at the Casino de Paris on 3–4 April 2018. It completed a French tour between February and May 2018. An extension of this tour took place between October 2018 and January 2019.\nOn 21 June 2018, during the Fête de la Musique, the band performed at the French National Assembly. The band released their second album Tako Tsubo in 2021 and their third album Pulsar in 2024. The band played Coachella in April 2022 and 2024.\nOn 26 September 2024, it was announced via Instagram that singer Flore Benguigui would be leaving the band, citing physical and mental health reasons, as well as \"profound personal, artistic and fundamental disagreements between the other members of the band and me.\" On 1 October 2024, the band revealed their new singer, Louve. Benguigui further elaborated on her departure an in interview with Mediapart, claiming that she was \"constantly being controlled, especially by two of the band members and the manager\", who would humiliate and scream at her in front of other band members, at one point losing her voice from being mistreated. The rest of the band denied the claims.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nMatahari (2018)\nTako Tsubo (2021)\nPulsar (2024)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nL'Imperatrice (2012)\nSonate pacifique (2014)\nOdysee (2015)\nL'Empereur (Odysee Slow Version) (2016)\nSequences (2017)\nSequences (Remixes) (2017)\nDreaming of You (2018)\nSubmarine (Remixes) (2021)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Sonate pacifique\" (2014)\n\"Vanille fraise\" (2016)\n\"Erreur 404\" (2017)\n\"Dreaming of You\" (Vibes4YourSoul Remix) (2018)\n\"Vacances\" (Yuksek Remix) (2018)\n\"Histoire d'un soir (Souvenirs d'été)\" (2018)\n\"Geisha\" (2018)\n\"Matahari\" (Red Axes Remix) (2018)\n\"Là-haut\" (2018)\n\"Stand on the Word\" (Le Grand Noël) (2018)\n\"Entre-deux\" (Onra x Pomrad Remix) (2018)\n\"Exit\" (2020)\n\"Fou\" (2020)\n\"Voodoo?\" (2020)\n\"Anomalie bleue\" (2020)\n\"Peur des filles\" (2021)\n\"Hématome\" (2021)\n\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" (InVersions 80s) (2021)\n\"Everything Eventually Ends\" (2022)\n\"Heartquake\" (2023)\n\"Me da igual\" (2024)\n\"Danza Marilù\" (2024)\n\"Any Way\" (featuring Maggie Rogers) (2024)\n\"Sweet & Sublime\" (featuring Erick the Architect) (2024)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nL'Impératrice on Facebook\nL'Impératrice on Instagram\nL'Impératrice's channel on YouTube"

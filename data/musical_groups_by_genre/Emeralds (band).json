    "text": "Emeralds is an American electronic music trio founded in 2006 by members John Elliott, Steve Hauschildt and Mark McGuire. The band was based in Cleveland, Ohio and then in Portland, Oregon, United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nEmeralds' sound has been noted for drawing from Ambient music, minimal music, and Kosmische.\nJohn Elliott, Steve Hauschildt and Mark McGuire began playing music together under the name Fancelions in 2005 in Cleveland's western suburbs of Bay Village and Westlake. Shortly thereafter, they re-formed as Emeralds, playing their first show under that name in June 2006. Since then the group has released over forty recordings on various independent labels. The album Does It Look Like I'm Here?, released on Editions Mego in 2010, is their most widely known release to date. It received the Best New Album designation from Pitchfork Media, the Album of the Year award from Drowned in Sound, and accolades from many other publications. Mark McGuire and Steve Hauschildt also perform and record under their own names, while John Elliott does so under a number of monikers including Outer Space and Imaginary Softwoods. The band also maintains multiple labels including McGuire & Elliott's Wagon, Hauschildt's Gneiss Things and Elliott's curated imprint Spectrum Spools.\nEmeralds were invited by Godspeed You! Black Emperor to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in December 2010 and again in 2012 by The Afghan Whigs.\nIn April 2009, the band opened for Throbbing Gristle's reunion tour in Chicago and New York.\nFrom 19 September through 31 October 2010, the band opened for Caribou on a North American tour.\nIn January 2013, Emeralds announced that Mark McGuire had left the band.  Though initially expected to continue as a duo, just weeks later Steve Hauschildt announced his own departure, saying that \"the band is now over\".\nAfter a decade-long absence; in November 2022, Primavera Sound announced the band have reunited and will perform at the original Barcelona and new Madrid locations of the 2023 Spanish music festival.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSolar Bridge (Hanson Records, 2008) - CD/LP\nEmeralds (Hanson Records, Wagon/Gneiss Things, 2009) - CD/LP\nWhat Happened (No Fun Productions 2009, Editions Mego 2010) - CD/2xLP\nDoes It Look Like I'm Here?

    "text": "De/Vision is a German synth-pop musical group formed in 1988. The band started as a quartet consisting of Thomas Adam, Steffen Keth, Stefan Blender, and Markus Ganssert. Blender left the band in 1991 and Ganssert departed in 2000. The name De/Vision is a play on words. The majority of the band's lyrics are in English, but they have had some songs in German.\nIn 2000, Keth started a side project as the vocalist with Green Court, called 'Green Court featuring De/Vision'. The band with remaining members Keth and Adam were then signed to Drakkar Records and Sony BMG in Europe, and Dancing Ferret Discs in North America.  The band is currently signed to Metropolis Records in North America. Since 1994 the band has released a new studio album of original material roughly every 1.5 years, until their 2012 album Rockets and Swords.\nIn 2009, the band started their own label, Popgefahr, primarily to release their own works as a response to the difficulty of garnering label support.\nOn 25 May 2018, the single \"They Won't Silence Us\" was released, and on 22 June, the new studio album Citybeats was released by the band. The LP was supported by a tour that started on 21 April 2018 and ended on 2 February 2019.\n\n\n== Members ==\nSteffen Keth - vocals, composition (1988-present)\nThomas Adam - synthesizer, songwriting, vocals (1988-present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nMarkus Ganssert - synthesizer, songwriting, composition (1988-2000)\nStefan Blender - synthesizer, composition (1988-1991)\n\n\n=== Touring members ===\nMarkus Koestner - drums (2005-2007, 2012–present)\nLars Baumgart - guitars (1998-2007)\nAchim Färber - drums (2000-2004)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\n1994 : World Without End\n1995 : Unversed In Love\n1995 : Antiquity\n1996 : Fairyland?\n1998 : Monosex\n1998 : Monosex (Instrumental)\n2000 : Void\n2000 : Void (Instrumental)\n2001 : Two\n2001 : Two (Instrumental)\n2003 : Devolution\n2003 : Devolution (Instrumental)\n2004 : 6 Feet Underground\n2004 : 6 Feet Underground (Instrumental)\n2006 : Subkutan (Deluxe)\n2006 : Subkutan (Instrumental)\n2007 : Noob\n2007 : Noob (Instrumental)\n2010 : Popgefahr\n2010 : Popgefahr + Bonus USB Stick\n2010 : Popgefahr (Instrumental)\n2011 : Popgefahr (Remixes)\n2012 : Rockets and Swords\n2012 : Rockets and Swords (Instrumental)\n2013 : Strange Days - World Without End (CD 1)\n2013 : Strange Days - Unversed In Love (CD 2)\n2013 : Strange Days - Unversed In Love (CD 3)\n2016 : 13\n2016 : 13 Extended\n2016 : 13 Extended (MCD)\n2016 : 13 Extended (Remix)\n2016 : 13 Extended (Instrumental)\n2016 : Two (Deluxe Edition)\n2017 : The Firing Line (Vocal Apollo Lovemachine Remix) EP\n2018 : Citybeats\n2018 : Citybeats (Limited Edition)\n\n\n=== EP, Tracks & Compilations ===\n1990 : Your Hands On My Skin EP\n1992 : Boy On The Street EP\n1993 : Try To Forget EP\n1994 : Dinner Without Grace EP\n1994 : Love Me Again EP\n1995 : Blue Moon EP\n1995 : Dress Me When I Bleed EP\n1995 : Unversed In Love + Bonus CD\n1996 : I Regret (Promo )EP\n1996 : I Regret EP\n1996 : Sweet Life EP\n1996 : Treasury...EP\n1998 : Hear Me Calling EP\n1998 : Strange Affection EP\n1998 : Strange Affection - Remixes EP\n1998 : We Fly...

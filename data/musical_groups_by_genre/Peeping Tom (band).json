    "text": "Peeping Tom were an American rock project led by Mike Patton, active between 2000 and 2007. They released one eponymous album and three singles on Ipecac Recordings. The project featured a rotating cast of musicians, including Amon Tobin, Massive Attack, Dub Trio, Odd Nosdam, Norah Jones, Bebel Gilberto, Dan the Automator, Rahzel, and Kool Keith.\nPeeping Tom has been called Patton's most mainstream-accessible work since his days with Faith No More.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Peeping Tom project was conceived in 2000 by singer Mike Patton (Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Fantômas, Tomahawk) and named after the 1960 film of the same name. Work on the self-titled album began in 2000, but it was delayed six years due to Patton's recording and touring work with his numerous other projects. Additionally, around this time, he collaborated with Björk on her 2004 album, Medúlla, and acted in the film Firecracker. The album was finally released in 2006, through Patton's own label, Ipecac Recordings.\nThe entire record was written by Patton together with various collaborators, including Norah Jones (\"Sucker\"), Kool Keith (\"Getaway\"), and Massive Attack (\"Kill the DJ\").\nThe first single was \"Mojo\", which featured Dan the Automator and Rahzel. It was accompanied by a music video featuring Danny DeVito, Mark Hoppus of Blink-182, and Rachel Hunter.\nIn 2023, Ipecac published the single \"Pre-School Love Affair\", which had previously been a B-side on \"Mojo\".\n\n\n== Musical style and influences ==\nPeeping Tom's music encompasses rock, heavy metal, experimental pop, pop, trip hop, alternative hip hop, underground hip hop, and hip hop.\n\n\n== Collaborators ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\"Mojo\" (2006)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPeeping Tom discography at Discogs \nAllmusic: Biography"

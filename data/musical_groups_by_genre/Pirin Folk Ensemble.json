It consists of a folk orchestra, a dance troupe, and a women's choir. The ensemble strives to preserve Bulgarian culture by performing traditional music and dance from throughout Bulgaria. It has performed over 6500 concerts in 50 different countries, and produced numerous LPs, CDs, videos, and songbooks.

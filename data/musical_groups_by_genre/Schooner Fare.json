    "text": "Schooner Fare is a  Maine-based folk band, consisting of Steve Romanoff (vocals, six and twelve-string guitar, five-string banjo), Gregory \"Chuck\" Romanoff (vocals, twelve-string guitar, tenor banjo), and formerly Tom Rowe (vocals, bass guitar, tin whistle). Schooner Fare performs primarily original maritime and traditional folk music. They perform throughout Maine and North America, and their songs are played by radio stations and satellite radio worldwide.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTom Rowe and brothers Steve and Chuck Romanoff were born and raised in southern Maine, and all attended the University of Maine.  Steve Romanoff earned a Ph.D. in humanities at New York University and taught at both high school and college level. Chuck earned a master's degree in counseling before becoming a social worker. Rowe majored in music, and was a high school band conductor and choral director.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRowe and the Romanoffs were members of a folk-rock bar band that split up because of differences in musical direction. That band, Devonsquare, was founded by the Romanoffs in 1964 and became a six-piece band. In 1975, Rowe and the Romanoffs founded Schooner Fare. Steven Romanoff says that the group's name refers to \"the relation of the price of passage to what's on board. To the victuals you eat.\"\nIn their early years, Schooner Fare focused on sea songs. Although they broadened their repertoire, their nautical songs have remained popular. Schooner Fare performs both traditional and original songs, sometimes updating the traditional works to more modern versions. Their regional radio hits include \"Portland Town\" and \"Salt Water Farm\" which they wrote about Maine's disappearing coastal farms. Schooner Fare's style has been compared to the Limelighters, the Chad Mitchell Trio, and the Journeymen.\n\nSchooner Fare's first performance was on Maine Public Television in November, 1975. Schooner Fare has performed throughout the United States, although their summer appearances are restricted to Maine. They appeared regularly at the Calgary Folk Music Festival. The band performed live on Good Morning America. Approximately a third of Schooner Fare's annual performances have been fund-raising concerts on behalf of nonprofit organizations. In 1984, music critic Bud Newman described Schooner Fare as \"the best folk group to come along in 20 years\". The band was described by a critic in The Boston Globe:Schooner Fare, balancing sturdy, three-part harmonies with standup, three-part comedy proved to be everything the old Kingston Trio should have been but never was: entertaining and infectious, without feeling unduly rote or slick. Or wearing matching shirts.\nSchooner Fare released their first album, Day of the Clipper, in 1978. Their album Alive was a live performance in Portland, Maine. Other albums included the 1987 Home for the Holidays, with songs in Hebrew, French, German, and Spanish, and SchoonerKids in 1997 with songs for younger listeners. On their 1989 album, Classic Schooner Fare, the group was accompanied by the Portland Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Mike Braz who also wrote the orchestral arrangements. The albums And Both Shall Row (2005) and Roots and Wings (2010) were recorded by the Romanoff brothers  after Rowe's death. Schooner Fare has its own record label, Outer Green Music Company, established in 1984, which publishes their albums.\nRowe, who had throat cancer, died of a heart attack in January, 2004. The Romanoff brothers continued performing as Schooner Fare. The first tribute concert for Tom Rowe took place in Portland on May 8, 2004, and became an annual event.\n\n\n== Albums ==\nDay of the Clipper - 6/1/1978\nCloser to the Wind - 6/1/1981\nAlive! - 6/1/1983\nWe the People - 7/10/1985\nThe First Ten Years - 6/1/1986\nHome for the Holidays - 10/1/1987\nClassic Schooner Fare - 6/1/1989\nSigns of Home - 8/1/1990\nFor the Times - 6/1/1993\nFinnegan's Wake - 6/2/1995\nSchooner Kids - 6/1/1997\nA 20th Anniversary Party - 6/1/1999\nOur Maine Songs - 6/15/1999\nAnd Both Shall Row - 10/1/2005\nRoots and Wings - 7/15/2010\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSchooner Fare home page"

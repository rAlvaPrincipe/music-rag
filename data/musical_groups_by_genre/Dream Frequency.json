    "text": "Dream Frequency are an English electronic music group, formed in Preston, Lancashire, England. Founded by Ian Bland in the late 1980s as one of his numerous projects, together with American singer Debbie Sharp, the duo performed initially at local events in the English rave clubs such as Shelley's.\nIn early 1992, the project gained their first hit single with \"Feel So Real\", which peaked at No. 23 on the UK Singles Chart. Shortly thereafter, \"Take Me\" reached No. 39 in the UK chart; the latter was released as a promo in the United States but failed to chart there. In 1994, their further efforts \"Good Times\" / \"The Dream\" (No. 67) and \"You Make Me Feel Mighty Real\" (No. 65) also made brief forays into the UK chart.\nAt the time, Ian Bland was also involved with fellow chart acts, Beat Renegades, Quake featuring Marcia Rae, and Red.\nAfter a long pause, Dream Frequency became active again at the beginning of the new millennium, and was still represented both nationally and internationally. Bland was also one half of Dancing Divaz, and also one half of Quake and Dejure. Bland is currently producing under Hollywood Hills and runs his own label Maison Records.\n\n\n== UK chart singles ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\nLarkin, Colin (1995).

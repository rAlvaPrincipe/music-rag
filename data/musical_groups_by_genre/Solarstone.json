    "text": "Richard Mowatt, commonly known by his stage name Solarstone (formerly spelled Solar Stone), is an Irish trance DJ and producer based in Wales. The music project Solarstone was founded in 1997 as a trio, and also used the pseudonyms Young Parisians, Liquid State and Z2. Over the years, Solarstone has developed a reputation for keeping to the original and classic trance sound. He is considered to be a veteran by fans in the trance music scene. Since 2012, Solarstone has been pushing forward a Pure Trance movement through tours where he aims to keep the trance genre true to its roots.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe music project Solar Stone was founded in Dudley in 1997 by Richard Mowatt, Andy Bury and Sam Tierney. Since 1994, the trio had been known as the Space Kittens. Sam Tierney left the group in 1997 owing to musical differences, and in 2006 Andy Bury also left, leaving Mowatt as the sole member.\nSolarstone has had three major hit singles in the UK. The most successful was Seven Cities, which reached number 39 in 1999. The song was one of the earliest and most famous examples of the Balearic trance genre, and has been re-released three times. The song has sold over 500,000 copies.\nIn 2003 and 2004, Solarstone collaborated with Scott Bond, releasing the three singles \"3rd Earth\", \"Naked Angel\" and \"Red Line Highway\". The group's debut album, AnthologyOne, was released in 2006. In 2008, their second studio album, Rain Stars Eternal, was released.\nSolarstone has also produced several remixes and collaborated with renowned trance artists such as Paul Oakenfold.\nIn 2014, Solarstone and Giuseppe Ottaviani began a collaboration project known as PureNRG. PureNRG have since released a number of singles, and perform live on stage regularly.\n\n\n== Radio shows ==\nThe Deep Blue Radioshow was produced by Rich Mowatt, the first episode of which was released on 19 May 2005.

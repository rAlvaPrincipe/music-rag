    "text": "3 Daft Monkeys are a world music-influenced acoustic band from Cornwall, UK, consisting of Tim Ashton, Athene Roberts, Rich Mulryne, and Jamie Graham. The instrumentation consists of vocals, fiddle, twelve-string guitar, bass guitar and percussion.\nThe band's musical influences include Celtic, Balkan, Romani, Latino, electronic dance, reggae, dub, punk rock, and traditional folk music. \nThe band have had great success at venues and festivals all over the UK and Europe, including being invited by Show of Hands to play the main stage at the Eden Project and the 2008 BBC Proms at St David's Hall in Cardiff. Other highlights include GuilFest; Lakefest festival[6]; Folkwoods, Holland; the Glastonbury Festival, the Trowbridge Village Pump Festival; Folk Segovia, Spain; Lorient Interceltic Festival, France; Kevelaer World Music Festival, Germany; Labadoux Festival, Belgium, Buskers Bern Street Festival in Switzerland, and enthusiastically welcomed returns to the Beautiful Days, Bearded Theory, and Larmer Tree festivals.\nThroughout the 2000s, the band were a regular support act for The Levellers, with Roberts usually returning to join the Levellers onstage for the finale in a duelling fiddle-off of \"What You Know\" with added tambourine from Waters and tin-whistle from Ashton.\nBetween March 2020 and June 2021, the band played over sixty 'Cyberbusks' online due to the various lockdowns and restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tim and Athene also collaborated with Scott Doonican of The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican on a cover of the Beatles' Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!. From July 2021, 3 Daft Monkeys were able to resume touring and played several major festivals including returns to Beautiful Days and Hawkfest.\nThe band have enjoyed airplay on BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio Ulster, BBC Radio Cornwall, and BBC Radio Wales, and have been described by presenter Mike Harding as \"a brilliant band... absolutely amazing\".\n\n\n== Line-up changes ==\nThe band's first album, Brouhaha, featured Rich Mulryne on djembe, kick drum, cymbals, tambourine and saucepan. From Ooomim onwards Waters played bass. Mulryne rejoined the band as a guest drummer for the album The Antiquated and the Arcane, and has since rejoined as a full member.\nIn 2011, Lukas Drinkwater joined the band as a temporary replacement for Jamie Waters for the summer tour, and later joined permanently after Waters stepped down. In 2015, Jamie Graham took over playing bass.\n\n\n== Releases ==\n\n\n=== Brouhaha (2000) ===\nSix songs recorded in Cornwall in 2000 with the band's original line-up.\n\nWonderful\n3 Daft Monkeys\nNothing\nMaximillian\nSaturn Returns\nGlobal Junkie\n\n\n=== Ooomim (2002) ===\nEight songs recorded in Germany, during October 2001 and released in 2002.\n\nFaces\nOoomim\nWe Be\nWeird-Id\nCrimson Eyes\nChuffy\nCheerio\nFor the Wedding\n\n\n=== Hubbadillia (2004) ===\nTen songs recorded by Mark Tucker at Presshouse Studios, Devon during the summer of 2004, released December 2004.\n\nHubbadillia\nHey Listen\nTrez Cerveza\nAir\nAstral Eyes\nBubbles\nThe Man\nStop\nTimeless\nDoes My Head In\n\n\n=== Gibbon It Live and Dreckly (2007) ===\n12 tracks recorded live at various venues during 2006.\n\nBroygas Tantz\nHubbadillia\nTres Cerveza\n3 Daft Monkeys\nOne Fine Day\nOoomim\nSocial Vertigo\nAstral Eyes\nHey Listen\nFaces\nMaximillian\nMazoltov\n\n\n=== Go Tell the Bees EP (2007) ===\nShowcasing three new tracks from the band's forthcoming album, plus one old favourite.\n\nGo Tell the Bees [Radio Edit]\nParanoid Big Brother\nSocial Vertigo [Radio Edit]\nAstral Eyes [Remastered]\n\n\n=== Social Vertigo (2008) ===\n13 Tracks recorded with Mark Tucker during 2007 at Green Room Studios .

Its members are Fermín IV (listed as Fermin IV Caballero Elizondo in credits), Patricio \"Pato Machete\" Chapa Elizalde, and Toy Kenobi (Antonio \"Toy\" Hernández).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group moved to the mainstream after their song \"Sí Señor\" was used as backing in the Levi's Super Bowl television commercial \"Crazy Legs\". However, their debut album was already a bestseller, with 100,000 units sold in Mexico and 400,000 in all of Latin America.\nIn 1998, Control Machete covered the song \"Amnesia\" included in the album Volcán: Tributo a José José, a tribute to Mexican legend José José.\nFermin IV left Control Machete in 2002 and released a solo album, Boomerang. He also collaborated with Cypress Hill on the track \"Siempre Peligroso\" on their album Los grandes éxitos en español.\nControl Machete's track \"Danzón\" was recorded in Cuba with Buena Vista Social Club's Rubén González. The songs \"Sí señor\", \"De Perros Amores\" and \"Pesada\" were included in the Alejandro González Iñárritu film Amores perros and its soundtrack. The band's music was also heard in the 2005 film Land of the Dead (\"En El Camino\"), as well as the 2006 film Crank (\"Bandera\") starring Jason Statham. \"Humanos Mexicanos\" played in an episode from the fifth season of the FX series Sons of Anarchy.\nThe group's music has appeared in several video games, including Total Overdose, Crackdown, and Scarface: The World Is Yours.\nTheir 2003 album reached No. 18 on the Latin Pop charts.\nThe group has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2004.

    "text": "The Notting Hillbillies were a country rock project formed by British singer-songwriter Mark Knopfler in May 1986. The group consisted of Knopfler (guitar and vocals), Steve Phillips (guitar and vocals), Brendan Croker (guitar and vocals), Guy Fletcher (keyboards and vocals), Paul Franklin (pedal steel), Marcus Cliffe (bass), and Ed Bicknell (drums). They gave their first performance at a small club in Leeds, and followed up with a tour.\nThe Notting Hillbillies recorded just one album, Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time, released on Vertigo in the UK (Warner Bros. in the US, reaching #52 on the Billboard albums chart) in 1990, before members returned to concentrate on their primary musical outlets. Three tracks from the album –  \"Your Own Sweet Way\", \"Feel Like Going Home\" and \"Will You Miss Me\" – were released as singles; some versions of these included \"Lonesome Wind Blues\", a track not on the album. The Notting Hillbillies reunited several times for charity gigs. In May 1997 the Hillbillies went on an 11 show tour in the UK.\nThe Town & Country Club in Leeds on 3 July 1993 only featured the Knopfler-Croker-Philips trio. The set list included the only known live performances of two Dire Straits songs : \"Ticket To Heaven\" and \"How Long\". The Notting Hillbillies had previously performed \"When It Comes to You\" in 1990, before it was actually recorded and issued by Dire Straits on their final album On Every Street, in 1991.  At the height of their fame, the Notting Hillbillies were the musical guest on the 19 May 1990 episode of Saturday Night Live, hosted by Candice Bergen.\nThe concert at The City Hall in Newcastle on 6 July 1993 featured Alan Clark on keyboards, his only appearance with the band. Ed Bicknell and Marcus Cliffe were also present. This was the last time that Clark played with Knopfler within a full band.\nIn 1993, two shows were performed, both without Guy Fletcher.\nBand member Brendan Croker died due to complications from leukaemia on 10 September 2023, at the age of 70.\n\n\n== Band line-up members ==\nMark Knopfler – guitar, vocals\nSteve Phillips – guitar, vocals\nBrendan Croker – guitar, vocals (died 2023)\nGuy Fletcher – keyboards, vocals\nPaul Franklin – pedal steel (studio album and 1990 tour only)\nMarcus Cliffe – bass\nEd Bicknell – drums (replaced by Danny Cummings for the four 2002 shows)\nChris White - Saxophone (1990)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Notting Hillbillies at IMDb\nThe Notting Hillbillies discography at Discogs"

    "text": "Apoptygma Berzerk (; commonly abbreviated to APB or APOP) is a Norwegian  band that produces a style of synth-pop and ballads backed with electronic rhythms, commonly known within the scene as \"futurepop\". Apoptygma Berzerk has won awards and top 10 spots in Germany and Scandinavia. Apoptygma Berzerk has toured Europe, North America, South America, Israel and Australia with bands such as VNV Nation, Beborn Beton, Icon of Coil and Unheilig.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe band was formed by Stephan Groth and Jon Erik Martinsen in 1989. Martinsen left the band due to creative differences. The name \"Apoptygma Berzerk\" has no particular meaning; frontman and founding member Groth claims that it was randomly picked out of a dictionary (the first word being derived from the Ancient Greek word ἀπόπτυγμα meaning \"piece of a tunic\").\n\n\n== Influences and style ==\nGroth has cited influences including Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Jean-Michel Jarre and John Carpenter. The first two albums, Soli Deo Gloria and 7, were a similar style of electropop and EBM. Welcome to Earth eschewed the dark themes of 7 for a lighter, less aggressive sound, and included a few experimental tracks. In Harmonizer the style changed a softer, more synthpop-oriented direction, compared to previous albums, and their 2006 album, You and Me Against the World, represented an almost complete change in style for the band. It featured a more mainstream, indie rock-oriented sound, and the complete departure from the band's traditional electric synthpop and EBM roots that started with 7. In 2009, they released their album Rocket Science.\nMany albums feature a hidden track that can be accessed by fast forwarding through many minutes of silence on the last album track. For instance, on 7, one can hear a remix of Nonstop Violence after Love Never Dies (Part II).\n\n\n== Cover songs ==\nThe band has recorded cover songs for several of their albums. On the American version of 7 a cover of \"Electricity\" by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark is featured; similarly, Welcome to Earth features a cover of Metallica's \"Fade to Black\". You and Me Against the World has a cover of \"Cambodia\" by Kim Wilde and \"Shine On\" by The House Of Love. They have also recorded covers of Depeche Mode's \"Enjoy the Silence\", Suede's \"Trash\", Keane's \"Bend and Break\", Kraftwerk's \"Ohm Sweet Ohm\" and Marilyn Manson's \"Coma White\". Most recently, they have covered Peter Schilling's \"Major Tom (Coming Home)\".\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nStephan Groth (STP a/k/a Grothesk) – vocals, programming, guitar, samples (1989–present)\nTed Skogmann – drums, additional guitar (1999–2002, 2011–present)\nJonas Groth – keyboards, production (2009–present)\nAudun Stengel (Angel) – guitar (2002–2009, 2013–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nGeir Bratland – keyboards, backing vocals (1995–2009)\nFredrik Brarud – drums (2002–2009)\nBrandon Smith – guitar (2009)\nJon Erik Martinsen – keyboards (1989)\nPer Aksel Lundgreen – keyboards (1990–1994)\nAnders Odden – guitars (1992–1999, 2003–2006)\nFredrik Darum – live guitar (1999–2001)\nThomas Jakobsen – drums (2009–2011)\n\n\n=== Live members ===\nLeandra Ophelia Dax – keyboards (2010–present)\n\n\n== Other collaborators ==\nVegard Blomberg of View\nPål Magnus Rybom of Echo Image\nClaudia Brücken of Propaganda\nBenji Madden of Good Charlotte\nAmanda Palmer of The Dresden Dolls\nEmil Nikolaisen of Serena Maneesh\nHåvard Ellefsen of Mortiis\nKurt Ebelhäuser of Blackmail\nAnneli Drecker of Bel Canto\nVile Electrodes\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nSoli Deo Gloria (1993)\n7 (1996)\nWelcome to Earth (2000)\nHarmonizer (2002)\nYou and Me Against the World (2005)\nRocket Science (2009)\nExit Popularity Contest (2016)\nSDGXXV (2019)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nApoptygma Berzerk at AllMusic \nApoptygma Berzerk discography at MusicBrainz\nInterview with Stephan Groth of Apoptygma Berzerk on NXLive.co.uk"

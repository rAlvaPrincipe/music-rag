    "text": "Jazz Q is a Czech jazz fusion band from Prague. It was established in 1964 in the former Czechoslovakia by musicians Martin Kratochvíl (keyboards) and Jiří Stivín (flute) but didn't gain recognition until the next decade. In 1970, Jazz Q released the jazz-rock album Coniunctio, together with Radim Hladík's Blue Effect. Stivín left the band the same year. Following this, the group took their music in the direction of electric jazz and art rock, with a new lineup that included Luboš Andršt on guitar, Vladimír Padrůněk on bass, and Michal Vrbovec on drums. In 1973, Jazz Q was joined by English blues singer Joan Duggan.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent\n\nMartin Kratochvíl – keyboards\nPast\n\nJiří Stivín – flute\nLuboš Andršt – guitar\nFrantišek Francl – guitar\nVladimír Padrůněk – bass\nMichal Vrbovec – drums\nJoan Duggan – vocals\nMirka Křivánková – vocals\nJana Kratochvílová – vocals\nAlexandr Čihař – bass\nPřemysl Faukner – bass\nLibor Laun – drums\nPavel Trnavský – drums\nVladimír Tomek – percussion\nOskar Petr – vocals\nZdeněk Fišer – guitar\nJaromír Helešic – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nConiunctio (1970)\nPozorovatelna  (1973)\nSymbiosis (1974)\nElegie (1976)\nZvěsti (1978)\nHodokvas (1979)\nHvězdoň (1984)\n1974-75 live (1991)\nThe Best of Jazz Q (1995)\nMartin Kratochvíl & Jazz Q (2007 – 8-CD box set)\nZnovu (2013)\nŽiví Se Diví: Live in Bratislava 1975 (2013)\nTalisman (2016)\nAmulet (2020)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nJazz Q discography at Discogs"

    "text": "The Last Dinner Party are a British indie rock band from London, formed in 2021. The band consists of Abigail Morris (vocals), Lizzie Mayland (vocals, guitar), Emily Roberts (lead guitar, mandolin, flute), Georgia Davies (bass) and Aurora Nishevci (keyboards, vocals). They have no permanent drummer, and are currently joined during live performances by Casper Miles.\nThe band signed with Island Records before releasing their debut single \"Nothing Matters\" in April 2023, which became a top 20 UK hit. They were awarded the Rising Star Brit Award in December 2023, subsequently winning the BBC Sound of 2024 poll. Their debut studio album, Prelude to Ecstasy, was released on 2 February 2024 and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\n== History ==\nMorris (from London), Davies (from Australia) and Mayland (from Hebden Bridge) met in 2020 during Freshers' Week at King's College London, and decided to form a band after frequently attending gigs together at The Windmill, feeling inspired by being part of the scene around the venue, with bands such as Black Midi and HMLTD. Their original name the Dinner Party was \"inspired by the idea of a huge debauched dinner party where people came together to celebrate with a hedonistic banquet\". Roberts was recommended to Morris as a guitarist by a mutual friend, and Nishevci was then brought in. Roberts and Nishevci attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. \n\nThe band initially struggled to find time to rehearse together because of the COVID-19 lockdown in the UK, and they did not perform live until their first gig at The George in London in November 2021. They signed with management group Q Prime in early 2022. They spent the following year honing their sound and building word-of-mouth support on the live circuit in London, including playing a set as the opening act (while still called The Dinner Party) for the Rolling Stones in Hyde Park in July 2022, along with supporting Benee on her world tour for the London show.\nAfter signing with Island Records as the Last Dinner Party (to avoid confusion with the jazz supergroup Dinner Party), they released their debut single \"Nothing Matters\", which was produced by James Ford, on 19 April 2023. The song was later announced as being part of the soundtrack for EA Sports FC 24. During the summer of 2023, the band supported Hozier, and played several festivals in the UK, Ireland and Europe, including Glastonbury and Latitude. They were also invited to play a live session on the BBC Radio 6 Music show, New Music Fix Friday. The band also opened for First Aid Kit on three of their UK dates in August 2023.\nThey released their second single \"Sinner\" on 30 June 2023, and their third single \"My Lady of Mercy\" on 9 October 2023, both of which were also produced by James Ford. They made their first appearance on the BBC show Later... with Jools Holland on 21 October 2023, performing \"Nothing Matters\" and \"My Lady of Mercy\". On 1 November 2023, the fourth single, \"On Your Side\" was released and the fifth single, \"Caesar on a TV Screen\" was released on 4 January 2024 a month prior to the release of their debut album Prelude to Ectasy. \nIn January 2024, they performed on the BBC’s The Graham Norton Show. They were the winners of the BRITs Rising Star award at the Brit Awards 2024. The album's sixth single, \"The Feminine Urge\", was released in July 2024.\nIn August 2024 the group announced that they will release Prelude to Ecstasy: Acoustics and Covers on 11 October 2024. The release features the entire Prelude to Ecstasy studio album along with five live and acoustic versions of songs from the studio album along with four cover songs performed in the studio and live. The first single, a cover of the Sparks song \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", was released on 28 August 2024.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\n\"Nothing Matters\", was described as \"art-rock bombast\" by Rolling Stone UK, while the Evening Standard described their music and live shows as having a \"distinctive baroque-pop sound and look\". The band have been compared to David Bowie, Fleetwood Mac, Kate Bush, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Roxy Music, ABBA, Queen, Sparks, Florence and the Machine and Warpaint. The band's members have cited Queen, St. Vincent, Chappell Roan and Lana Del Rey as leading influences.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAbigail Morris – lead vocals\nLizzie Mayland – vocals, guitar, flute\nEmily Roberts – lead guitar, mandolin, flute, vocals\nGeorgia Davies – bass guitar, vocals\nAurora Nishevci – keyboard, organ, piano, synthesizer, keytar, vocals\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nCurrent live touring members\n\nCasper Miles – drums, percussion (2024–present)\nFormer live touring members\n\nIsis Dunthorne – drums, percussion (2023)\nRebekah Rayner – drums, percussion (2023–2024)\nDaiana Azar – drums, percussion (2024) (Europe, US & Canada)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n=== Prelude to Ecstasy – A Short Film By The Last Dinner Party ===\nIn August 2024, the group announced the release of their film, Prelude to Ecstasy – A Short Film By The Last Dinner Party, which was released on 12 September 2024.

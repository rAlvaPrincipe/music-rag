    "text": "Irie Révoltés was a music band from Heidelberg, Germany, formed in 2000. Among its nine members, the brothers \"Mal Élevé\" and \"Carlito\" have French origins. For this reason, many of the band's song lyrics are in French. The word \"irie\" derives from Jamaican Patois and can be loosely translated as \"positive\" or \"happy\", whereas \"révoltés\" means \"rebels\" in French. Their music was mainly influenced by genres like reggae, dancehall, ska, punk, electro, and hip hop.\nThe band's songs deal with controversial social issues, and they regularly performed at demonstrations and charity events, in support of political and social projects. In October 2016, they announced their final concert, which took place on 26 December 2017.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\nPablo \"Mal Élevé\" Charlemoine\nCarlos \"Carlito\" Charlemoine\nAndreas \"Silence\" Spreier\nTobias \"idoT\" von Kitzing\nZiggi\nKing Kong\nChristian \"Chriggi\" Comba\nTobias \"Toby!\" Bär\nMichael \"Mickez\" Comba\nFelix \"Flex\" Mussell\nConrad \"Conriot\" Sievers\nValentin v.

    "text": "Hi-Five is an American R&B quintet from Waco, Texas. Hi-Five had a No. 1 hit on Billboard's Hot 100 in 1991 with \"I Like the Way (The Kissing Game)\". \nThe band was formed in 1989 and originally consisted of a trio; with childhood friends Tony Thompson, Russell Neal, and Oklahoma native, Toriano Easley. Jive Records, later suggested that the trio's other childhood friends, Roderick \"Pooh\" Clark, and Marcus Sanders, be added to the group, with them being signed as an official ensemble, making the five of them together, the founding original members of Hi-Five.\nDuring the release of their debut album, Toriano Easley was charged with a crime, which involved a dispute with his neighborhood friends, which made him unable to continue with the group. The label recruited New York native Treston Irby, as a replacement member. After the release of their second album, Russell Neal left the group after financial conflicts with the record label. Unfortunately congruently, while the group was on tour carrying on as four members, Roderick \"Pooh\" Clark was injured in a vehicle collision, making him paralyzed from the chest down, which his injuries made him depart from the group. The label added Shannon Gill, and Terrence Murphy as replacement members.\nWhen the group decided to accept Giant records offer, and change labels, while their Jive contract was still pending, Giant records, instead decided to focus their attention on lead singer Tony Thompson, neglecting the projects related to the group. Because of this discrepancy, the group disbanded. Tony Thompson was later signed to Bad Boy Records. In 2005, without consulting the initial members of Hi-Five, Tony Thompson put together several new vocalists to form a new incarnation of the band, under the Hi-Five name. This later resulted in a legal battle, between Thompson and former Hi-Five members, which put the band on even more haphazard terms. In 2007, lead singer Tony Thompson, died in drug related circumstances. In 2012, as a result of Thompson's passing, the remaining members of Hi-Five in Thompson's honor, decided to reunite. In 2022, Roderick \"Pooh\" Clark died. \n\n\n== Early career ==\nHi-Five was originally signed to Jive Records in late 1989 and released their eponymous debut album in 1990. The album was produced by Teddy Riley and went platinum. It included singles \"I Just Can't Handle It\" (R&B No. 10), \"I Can't Wait Another Minute\" (Pop No. 8, R&B No.1) and \"I Like the Way (The Kissing Game)\", which went to number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the U.S. Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart (making it their biggest hit to date). \nThe group's second LP, Keep It Goin' On, was released in 1992. Though not as successful as their debut effort, several tracks from this album, including \"She's Playing Hard to Get\" (Pop No. 5, R&B No. 2) and the R. Kelly-penned \"Quality Time\" (Pop No. 38, R&B No. 3) got major airplay in East Coast (US) urban markets. Shortly after this album was released, the group was involved in a vehicular accident, which left Roderick \"Pooh\" Clark paralyzed from the chest down.\nIn 1993, Hi-Five emerged with a third album, Faithful, which featured the songs \"Unconditional Love\" (Pop No. 92, R&B No. 21) and \"Never Should've Let You Go\" (Pop No. 30, R&B No. 10). \"Unconditional Love\" was also featured in the multi-platinum Menace II Society soundtrack, and received extensive airplay on urban contemporary stations throughout the summer of 1993 as the movie increased in popularity. \"Never Should've Let You Go\" was featured on the Sister Act 2 soundtrack.\n\n\n== Later career ==\nOn June 1, 2007, Tony Thompson's body was discovered by security officers at around 10 p.m. near an air-conditioning unit outside of an apartment complex in his native Waco, Texas. An autopsy later determined that he had died from \"toxic effects of chlorodifluoromethane\", or inhaling a toxic amount of freon. He is buried at Doris Miller Memorial Park in Waco.\nIn 2011, Treston Irby released his debut solo single \"Everything\" under the mantle Tru$ on his independent label, Bronx Most Wanted Ent. \nIn 2012, Irby, Shannon Gill and Marcus Sanders reformed Hi-Five with two new members, Andre Ramseur (aka Dre Wonda) and Faruq Evans. They released a single called \"Favorite Girl\" also on the BMW label. Ramseur later left the group and was replaced by Billy Covington. \nOn July 2, 2014, former Hi-Five member Russell Neal was charged with murder, over the fatal stabbing of his wife in Houston.\nHi-Five was featured on the TVOne music documentary series Unsung on August 6, 2014, chronicling the quintet's upbringing in Waco, their rise to superstardom, tragedies among group members, and their comeback.\nFormer member Roderick “Pooh” Clark died on April 17, 2022, at the age of 49.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== EP ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nHi-Five at IMDb\nHi-Five at AllMusic\nHi-Five discography at Discogs"

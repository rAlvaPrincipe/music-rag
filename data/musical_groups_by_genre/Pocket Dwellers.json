    "text": "The Pocket Dwellers are a Canadian seven-member experimental hip-hop group from the Toronto area. The band's main genre is hip-hop, but their music is influenced by jazz, funk, soul and breakbeat.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Pocket Dwellers began forming together in 1996.   That year the band performed at EdgeFest in Toronto. In 1999 the band performed in Hamilton as part of Showcase '99.\nThe Pocket Dwellers released their first full-length record in 2000 after they signed a recording deal with Song Corp, and a second album, Digitally Organic, later that year. Song Corp went bankrupt in early 2001, leaving the second album with no promotion.\nThe next release was the album recorded live during sold-out performances at a club in Toronto called the Reverb.  The recording was released under Urbnet records.\nIn 2005 they signed with Blue Note/EMI and released PD-Atrics.  The recording was more hip hop based and involved less live instrumentation than had been employed in the past.  In 2006 the band was nominated for a Juno award for best new group.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMember roster of The Pocket Dwellers.\n\nDennis Passley \"Deknow\" – tenor saxophone\nNigel Williams \"N.I.Gel\" – vocals\nJohn Griffith \"Quest\" – saxophone, flute\nMarco Raposo \"Red\" – drums\nGord Shields \"Jupiter\" – bass guitar\nChristian McKibbin \"Holy C\" – guitar\nSheldon Moore \"S-luv\" – turntables\nDave Leitao \"Epstein\" - keyboard\nguest musicians:\nBrownman Ali – trumpet\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nLimited Edition - EP (1998)\nDigitally Organic (August 29, 2002)\nLifecheck (August 19, 2003)\nPD-Atrics (October 4, 2005)\nConception: The Mix Tape Volume 2 (2005)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nPocket Dwellers at allmusic.com"

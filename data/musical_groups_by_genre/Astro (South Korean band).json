    "text": "Astro (Korean: 아스트로; stylized in all caps) is a South Korean boy band formed by Fantagio. The group is composed of four members: MJ, Jinjin, Cha Eun-woo, and Yoon San-ha. Originally a sextet, Rocky departed from the group on February 28, 2023, and Moonbin died on April 19, 2023. They debuted on February 23, 2016, with the extended play Spring Up and were subsequently named as one of the best new K-pop acts of 2016 by Billboard.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut ===\nAstro was formed through the rookie talent development program \"iTeen Boys\", which was created by their agency Fantagio. In August 2015, the final member line-up and group name were announced. The same month, the group starred in a web drama titled To Be Continued, which aimed to introduce them to the public. The drama featured the members as themselves, as well as Kim Sae-ron, Seo Kang-joon, and the girl group Hello Venus.\nAfter their web drama finished airing, the group started the \"Meet U\" project. As part of the project, Astro traveled through South Korea, covering songs in front of crowds and holding fan meetings. Along with the performances, a KakaoTalk Plus Friends account was set up. Fantagio stated that once the group had gathered 10,000 friends on the app, they would announce their official debut date. The goal was met by December 2015. Their debut showcase, held on January 28, 2016, was sold out in under a minute and far exceeded the original limit of 1,000 attendants. There, they also announced their official fan club name, Aroha.\nThey also appeared in their own reality TV show titled Astro OK! Ready, which began airing on January 21, 2016, on MBC every1 and concluded on February 18, 2016.\n\n\n=== 2016: Debut with Spring Up and rising popularity ===\nOn February 23, 2016, Astro released their debut extended play Spring Up alongside its lead single \"Hide & Seek\". For two days, starting on February 22, 2016, showcases and press conferences were held at Lotte Card Art Center and Wapop Concert Hall to commemorate the group's first release. Within a week of its release, Spring Up reached number six on the Billboard World Albums Chart in the United States, as well as number four on the Gaon Album Chart.\n On February 25, the group released the music video for \"Cat's Eye\" (장화 신은 고양이), containing clips from their web drama To Be Continued. On April 13, Astro was the only Korean act invited to the LeTV Entertainment Awards in China. Due to their popularity in China, Cha Eun-woo was also offered a role in a Chinese drama shortly after their debut.\nTheir second extended play Summer Vibes was released on July 1. The album peaked at number six on the Billboard World Albums Chart and at number two on the Gaon Album Chart. Furthermore, the music video for \"Breathless\" (숨가빠), featuring labelmate Choi Yoo-jung of Weki Meki, surpassed half a million views in just three days. The same month, on July 31, Astro performed in front of more than 20,000 people at Staples Center in Los Angeles for KCON 2016.\nJust five months after their debut, Astro held their first solo mini concert titled Astro 2016 Mini Live – Thankx Aroha from August 27 to 28 at the KEPCO Art Center in Seoul. Additional showcases were held in Japan, Indonesia, and Thailand throughout the months of October and November.\nThe group released their third extended play Autumn Story on November 10. The music video to its lead single \"Confession\" (고백) featured Sei of Weki Meki. Simultaneously, their reality TV show Astro Project A.S.I.A, which explored the events of their first oversea showcases, began airing. In December, Billboard named Astro one of the best new K-pop groups of 2016.\n\n\n=== 2017–2018: First tour, group hiatus, and Rise Up ===\n\nOn February 22, 2017, one day before their one-year anniversary, Astro's four seasons project came to a close with their special album Winter Dream. The album and its lead single \"Again\" (붙잡았어야 해) were neither promoted on any music shows nor did they receive a music video. The group did, however, resume their overseas showcases with performances in Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The group released their fourth extended play Dream Part.01, featuring the lead single \"Baby\", on May 29. The album placed sixth on the Billboard World Albums Chart. The same month, Astro signed a contract with Avex Taiwan to handle their music distribution in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. On July 15, 2017, the group started their first tour, titled The 1st Astroad to Seoul, in Seoul at Olympic Hall, later expanding it with stops in Osaka, and Tokyo. On November 1, Astro released their fifth extended play Dream Part.02, featuring the lead single \"Crazy Sexy Cool\" (니가 불어와). A limited \"Wish\" edition of the EP was released on January 10, 2018. All 10,000 copies were sold out in pre-orders alone. The edition contains a poem written by member Cha Eun-woo titled \"Purple Evening\", a hidden \"Thanks to\", as well as polaroid pictures taken by the members themselves.\nThe group held a second showcase in Taiwan on January 20, 2018, at the Taipei International Convention Center (TICC). Throughout the months of February and March, Astro held twelve fan meetings across nine cities around the world, visiting the United States, Canada, South Korea, Japan, and Thailand. On July 24, after a prolonged hiatus, Astro released their second special extended play Rise Up alongside its lead single \"Always You\" (너잖아).

Still, the group proceeded to hold their second Japan tour The 2nd Astroad to Japan in August, with performances in Nagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo. Another tour titled The 2nd Astroad to Seoul [Star Light] (Part 1) in South Korea followed, concluding on December 23 with a last performance in Seoul at KBS Hall.\n\n\n=== 2019: First studio album All Night, Japanese debut with Venus, and Moonbin's hiatus ===\nOn January 16, 2019, following their 14-month hiatus without any full comeback, Astro released their first studio album All Light.

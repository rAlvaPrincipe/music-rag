    "text": "3A is a German pop band consisting of brothers Aaron, Abel, and Adam Lovac.\n\n\n== Band history ==\nThe Lovac brothers were discovered in Nieukerk, Germany, when they were between the ages of only 11 to 13 years old. In 2010, they published their first album titled Teenage Queen. This led to their discovery by German producer Peter Hoffmann and a record deal with the major label Sony Music. At first, the band was known as LaLaLa, however they changed their name to 3A before the publication of their next album, #wirsindhier. In 2013 they were included in the opening act for Tyler Ward's 11 concerts in Germany. In February 2014, the band released their first single, Sind Wir Freunde?, which reached 81 on the German singles chart. Their album #wirsindhier appeared with some delay in April of that year and also reached the 85th spot on the chart.\nIn May 2016 Lina Larissa Strahl published her album Official, as a part of which band member Aaron Lovac accompanies Strahl for the song MÃ¤dchen liebt das Feuer.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nAaron Lovac,  (1996-09-20) September 20, 1996, Singer and Drummer\nAbel Lovac,  (1998-02-23) February 23, 1998, Singer and Guitarist\nAdam Lovac,  (1999-02-04) February 4, 1999, Singer and Bassist\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nTeenage Queen (2010)\n#wirsindhier (2014)\nSongs\n\nSind wir Freunde?

    "text": "L'Infonie was an avant-garde Québécois chamber ensemble under the direction of composers Walter Boudreau and Raôul Duguay. They produced four albums between 1969 and 1974, after which the project ended. It was intended both as a music group and a new approach to collective improvisation; Duguay published its manifesto in 1970. The group released a number of albums on the avant-garde side of Quebec's progressive rock and jazz-rock scenes before dissolving in 1973. The ensemble was highly influential in the Montreal avant-garde music scene, and their albums became sought-out collectors items.\nThe ensemble's third album, Vol. 333, was re-released on vinyl in 2016 by Montreal label Mucho Gusto.\n\n\n== L'Infonie inachevée ==\nL'Infonie inachevée, a 1973 documentary film by Roger Frappier about the ensemble, won the Canadian Film Award for Best Sound at the 25th Canadian Film Awards, before going into wider release in 1974.\nA restored version of the film was screened as part of the 2022 Festival du nouveau cinéma's Estival program of summer repertory screenings, before going into commercial release in 2023.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1969: Vol. 3\n1971: Vol. 33: le Mantra\n1972: Vol. 333\n1974: Vol. 3333\n\n\n== References =="

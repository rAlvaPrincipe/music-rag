    "text": "The Berliner Symphoniker (Berlin Symphony Orchestra) is a German symphony orchestra based in Berlin, Germany.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe orchestra began its performing activity on 1 September 1967 as Symphonisches Orchester Berlin, under the auspices of the Berliner Orchestervereinigung e.V., after the merger of two independent orchestras, the Berliner Symphonisches Orchester and the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester.  Carl August Bünte, who had been chief conductor of the Berliner Symphonisches Orchester, was the first chief conductor of the newly formed ensemble, and held the position until 1973.  From 1967 to 1990, the orchestra performed as the Symphonisches Orchester Berlin.  In 1990, the orchestra was renamed the Berliner Symphoniker.\nIn 2004, the Berlin Senate withdrew its support of the orchestra, which subsequently entered bankruptcy proceedings.  Subsequently, the Berolina Orchester eV association took over management of the orchestra.  Since 2019, the current Intendantin (managing director) of the orchestra is Sabine Völker, the first woman to hold the post.\nThe longest-serving chief conductor of the orchestra was Lior Shambadal, from 1996 to 2019.  In April 2021, the orchestra announced the appointment of Hansjörg Schellenberger as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2021-2022 season.\n\n\n== Concert tours ==\n1996: Brazil\n1998–2000: USA, Egypt, United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, Italy\n2001: Italy, United Kingdom, South America\n2002: Japan\n2004: Japan, Hungary, Czech Republic, Frankfurt am Main\n2005: South Korea, China, Switzerland, Italy, Greece\n2006: Spain, Switzerland\n2007: Argentina (Buenos Aires; International Festival Ushuaia), Italy, Japan, China\n2008: Festival de Mallorca, Japan, China\n\n\n== Chief conductors ==\nCarl August Bünte (1967–1973)\nTheodore Bloomfield (1975–1982)\nDaniel Nazareth (1982–1985)\nAlun Francis (1989–1996)\nLior Shambadal (1996–2019)\nHansjörg Schellenberger (2021–2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the Berliner Symphoniker\nGerman-language history page on the Berliner Symphoniker\nSound carrier of Berliner Symphoniker in the German National Library catalogue"

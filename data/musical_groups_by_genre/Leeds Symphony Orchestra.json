It is a non-professional orchestra based in Leeds, Yorkshire, with a membership of around 80 players. Up to ten concerts a year are given at venues including Leeds, Knaresborough, Wetherby and Horsforth. The orchestra's repertoire in recent years has ranged from seventeenth-century music to present-day works.\n\n\n== Conductor ==\nMartin Binks was the orchestra's conductor for 49 years from September 1970 to December 2019, making him one of the longest-serving conductors in the UK.

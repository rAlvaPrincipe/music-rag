    "text": "The New Jazz Composers Octet is an all-acoustic jazz ensemble founded by trumpeter/arranger David Weiss in 1996.  NPR's Josh Jackson described them as \"part New York hustle and part writer's workshop, all of it redolent with the aroma of newness.\"  The title track of The Turning Gate won the group a Chamber Music Association grant.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter meeting some of the musicians in 1996—pianist Xavier Davis, bassist Dwayne Burno, and drummer Nasheet Waits—David Weiss, who was working on arrangements for Freddie Hubbard, decided to form a self-determining cooperative ensemble, eventually deciding on an octet, leading to a search for wind players.  The first musicians added to the group were Gregory Tardy, Myron Walden, and James Farnsworth.  Farnsworth died after the release of their first recording, and the chair of baritone saxophone has been revolving — three others have filled the position since.  Jimmy Greene who was a guest artist on the first album was a full member by the second, as were Steve Davis and Chris Karlic.  The second album featured guest appearances by Craig Handy and Joe Chambers.  Their third and most recent album, The Turning Gate added Norbert Stachel on baritone sax.\n\n\n== Members ==\nDavid Weiss (trumpet and fluglehorn)\nMyron Walden (alto sax, flute)\nJimmy Greene (tenor sax, soprano sax, flute)\nSteve Davis (trombone)\nNorbert Stachel (baritone sax, bass clarinet)\nXavier Davis (piano)\nDwayne Burno (bass)\nNasheet Waits (drums)\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nAndrew Williams (trombone)\nDanny Grissett (piano)\nGregory Tardy (tenor saxophone)\nJames Farnsworth (baritone sax)\nDave Rickenberg (baritone sax)\nChris Karlic (baritone sax)\n\n\n=== Honorary members ===\nCraig Handy (saxophone)\nJoe Chambers (drums)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nFirst Steps into Realty (Fresh Sound New Talent, 1998)\nWalkin' the Line (Fresh Sound New Talent, 2003)\nThe Turning Gate (Motéma Music, 2008)\nwith Freddie Hubbard\nNew Colors (Hip Bop, 2001)\nOn the Real Side (Times Square, 2008)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nThe New Jazz Composers Octet at Motéma Music"

    "text": "Hidria Spacefolk is a Finnish progressive / psychedelic rock / space rock band. The group's sound is often compared to Kingston Wall and Ozric Tentacles. The band describes their musical style as Astro-Beat. They use many different instruments such as the cello, violin, flute, didgeridoo, marimba, mandolin, sitar and vibraphone.\nHidria Spacefolk's first album was the independently released EP HDRSF-1 in 2001. Their debut full-length, Symbiosis, was released a year later through Silence, a subsidiary label of Wolfgang Records. The band's second full-length album, Balansia, was released in 2004 and included Andy McCoy of Hanoi Rocks as a guest musician. The same year, a compilation album titled Violently Hippy rmxs was also released. The album contains remixes of Hidria Spacefolk's songs done by Finnish electronic music makers.\nTheir performance at the North East Art Rock Festival in Pennsylvania, US (July 2004) was released as Live Eleven am, in 2005.\nIn 2005 the band opened the second day of the international progressive rock festival that took place in Moscow, Russia.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMikko Happo – guitars\nSami Wirkkala – guitars\nVeikko Aallonhuippu (formerly Sutinen) – keyboards & synths (2008- )\nOlli Kari – Xylosynth, mallets & percussions (2010- and on albums Symbiosis, Balansia)\nKimmo Dammert – bass\nTeemu Kilponen – drums\n\n\n== Hidria Family ==\nJanne Lounatvuori – keyboards (1999-2008)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHDRSF-1 (2001, EP)\nSymbiosis (2002)\nBalansia (2004)\nViolently Hippy rmxs (2004, compilation)\nLive Eleven am (2005, live recording)\nSymetria (2007)\nLive at Heart (2007, live recording)\nCycloop (2012, single)\nAstronautica (2012)\nGöbekli Tepe (2024, single)\nRama Rama (2024, single)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website snapshot at web.archive.org\nHidria Spacefolk at Last.fm\nHidria Spacefolk at bandcamp.com"

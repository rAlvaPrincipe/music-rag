    "text": "20/20 was an American power pop band based in Hollywood, California. They were active from 1977 to 1983 and reunited during the mid-1990s to the late 1990s. In the mid-1970s, Steve Allen and Ron Flynt played together in Tulsa. Allen and Flynt were graduates of Nathan Hale High School, and both attended Oklahoma State University, where Flynt earned a degree in music. Allen decided to move to Los Angeles in 1977 after fellow Tulsa natives Phil Seymour and Dwight Twilley met with success. Once in Los Angeles, Allen met with Mike Gallo (singer/songwriter/keyboardist/drummer), who had already conceived of the idea and name for the band (after having spent time in the UK). Gallo first started writing with Allen, and later auditioned Allen's friend from Tulsa, Ron Flynt, for 20/20. The three-piece band signed with Greg Shaw's Bomp! Records in 1978 to record a single. Between the release of the single, and their first LP on Portrait Records, Chris Silagyi joined the band as a keyboardist.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nSteve Allen – guitar, vocals\nRon Flynt – bass, vocals\nMike Gallo – drums (1977–1979)\nChris Silagyi – keyboards, guitar, vocals (1979–1981)\nJoel Turrisi – drums (1979–1981)\nDean Korth - drums (1981–1983)\nBill Belknap – drums (1983–1984, 1995–2005)\n\n\n== Personnel changes and break-up ==\nDuring the recording of the first album, Gallo was let go from the band. Phil Seymour played drums on all of the album's songs except one. Afterwards Joel Turrisi joined and played on Look Out!, their second album. The third album, Sex Trap, was recorded with drummer Dean Korth and released on Mainway Records, followed by a later release on Enigma Records. 20/20 then split up.\nFlynt moved to Austin, opened his own recording studio, and headlined the 2005 Austin music festival with a newly released CD on Zip records including the powerpop tune \"Mary's World\".  Steve Allen moved to Nashville, Tennessee and continued to record and write music there. Chris Silagyi became a record (The Untouchables, Dave Alvin, The Redskins) and video producer. Joel Turrisi became an actor and works in other areas of film & music. After splitting with 20/20 in late 1979 (and taking twenty unreleased/recorded 20/20 songs, which he is the sole writer, with him) Mike Gallo went on to form the bands RadioMusic and Two Moons, and signed a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell.\n\n\n== Current activities ==\nFive band members now operate five different recording studios in five different cities.\nRon Flynt - Jumping Dog Studio in Austin, Texas.

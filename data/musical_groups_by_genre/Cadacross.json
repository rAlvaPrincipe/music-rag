    "text": "Cadacross was a Finnish melodic death metal band formed in 1997. They went through a major line-up change after their debut album So Pale Is the Light. Georg Laakso, guitarist and vocalist, was the only remaining member from the previous lineup. By Cadacross' second album Corona Borealis, their sound had become more distinctive and had more in common with such bands as Turisas and other Finnish viking and folk metal bands.\n\n\n== End of band ==\nOn October 27, 2005, Laakso was incapacitated after a motoring accident that caused injuries to his spinal cord, and brought about the end of Cadacross and the career of Laakso as guitarist for Turisas.

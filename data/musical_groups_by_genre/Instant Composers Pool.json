    "text": "Instant Composers Pool (ICP) is an independent Dutch jazz and improvised music label and orchestra. Founded in 1967, the label takes its name from the concept that improvisation is \"instant composition\". The ICP label has published more than 50 releases to date, with most of its releases featuring the ICP Orchestra and its members.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nIn 1967 saxophonist Willem Breuker, pianist Misha Mengelberg and drummer Han Bennink founded the ICP label in Amsterdam. Mengelberg and Bennink had been playing together since 1961 and found success as members of Eric Dolphy's quartet in 1964, as documented on his live album Last Date. Mengelberg had also been involved in the Fluxus art movement and was developing a composition style that involved musical games. As European free jazz musicians, they were butting up against disinterest in their music from contemporary jazz labels, so they formed a cooperative as a means to release their own recordings. Mengelberg coined the label's name as a testament to improvisation being composition at the instant that the music is played. ICP's first records documented Breuker and Bennink's New Acoustic Swing Duo, and a trio of Mengelberg and Bennink with John Tchicai, whose album was titled Instant Composers Pool.\nBreuker left ICP in 1974 to concentrate on his group, the Willem Breuker Collective, and went on to found his own record label, BVHaast. Mengelberg and Bennink intensified their collaboration and, widening their own musical project as the Instant Composers Pool Tentet with saxophonist Peter Brötzmann and cellist Tristan Honsinger. Throughout the 1970s, the ICP label continued to release records, many as co-productions with other European independent labels, including albums by Jeanne Lee, Derek Bailey, Dudu Pukwana, Steve Lacy, Paul Rutherford, Evan Parker, Maarten Altena and Peter Brötzmann. Most of these releases were of limited (and sometimes even numbered) edition and featured a distinctive idiosyncratic graphic design by Bennink.\n\n\n=== 1980s–present ===\nBy the 1980s, the ICP began to recruit younger musicians, as well as classical/new music violinist Mary Oliver. Under Mengelberg's guidance, the ICP Orchestra made studies of and recorded albums of music by jazz greats Duke Ellington, Herbie Nichols and Thelonious Monk. In the late 1980s and early 90s, ICP members collaborated with members of American post-punk/Indie rock band Sonic Youth and began their long musical career with Dutch experimental punk band The Ex with whom they continue to tour and record.\nIn recent years, the ICP label has focused its releases solely on members of the ICP Orchestra, including Wolter Wierbos, Mary Oliver, Tristan Honsinger and Tobias Delius. The label's earlier vinyl and cassette back catalog had not been issued on CD until the release of the label's complete catalogue as a 54-disc boxed set to commemorate the ICP's 45th anniversary in 2012.\n\n\n== Label discography ==\nICP 001: Willem Breuker/Han Bennink New Acoustic Swing Duo LP (1967)\nICP 002: Misha Mengelberg/Han Bennink/John Tchicai Instant Composers Pool LP (1968)\nICP 003: Willem Breuker Lunchconcert for Three Barrelorgans LP\nICP 004: Han Bennink/Derek Bailey LP\nICP 005: Misha Mengelberg/John Tchicai/Han Bennink/Derek Bailey Fragments LP\nICP 006: Misha Mengelberg/Paul Rutherford/Peter Bennink/Peter Brötzmann/Evan Parker/Han Bennink/Derek Bailey Groupcomposing  LP (1971)\nICP 007/008: Various artists Instant Composers Pool 2×LP (1970)\nICP 009: Willem Breuker The Message LP (1971)\nICP 010: Misha Mengelberg/Han Bennink Instant Composers Pool LP (1972)\nICP 011: Han Bennink Solo  LP\nICP 012: Maarten van Regteren Altena Handicaps LP\nICP 013: Misha Mengelberg/Han Bennink Een Mirakelse Tocht six 7\" flexi-discs (1972)\nICP 013: Misha Mengelberg/Han Bennink Midwoud '77  LP (1974)\nICP 014/SAJ 03: Misha Mengelberg/Han Bennink Einepartietischtennis LP (1974)\nICP 015: Eric Dolphy/Misha Mengelberg/Jacques Schols/Han Bennink Epistrophy  LP\nICP 016: Steve Lacy Lumps LP\nICP 017/018: Misha Mengelberg/Han Bennink Coincidents double cassette (1976)\nICP 019: Maarten van Regteren Altena Tuning the Bass LP\nICP 020: ICP 10-tet Tetterettet LP (1977)\nICP 021: Dudu Pukwana/Han Bennink/Misha Mengelberg Yi Yole LP\nICP 022: ICP Orchestra Live Soncino LP\nICP 023: Misha Mengelberg/Han Bennink Bennink Mengelberg LP\nICP 024: Misha Mengelberg & ICP Orchestra Japan Japon LP (1982)\nICP 025: ICP Orchestra Extension Red White and Blue (Herbie Nichols) cassette (1984)\nICP 026: ICP Orchestra Two Programs: Herbie Nichols/Thelonious Monk CD (1987)\nICP 027: Han Bennink Solo VHS\nICP 028: ICP Orchestra Bospaadje Konijnehol I CD (1990)\nICP 029: ICP Orchestra Bospaadje Konijnehol II CD (1991)\nICP 030: Misha Mengelberg Mix CD\nICP 031: Misha Mengelberg/Han Bennink MiHa CD + anniversary book\nICP 032: Wolter Wierbos X Caliber CD\nICP 033: Tobias Delius 4 Tet The Heron CD\nICP 034: Tobias Delius 4 Tet Toby's Mloby CD\nICP 035: Han Bennink Solo\nICP 036: Tristan Honsinger A Camel's Kiss CD\nICP 037: Steve Beresford/Han Bennink B + B (in Edam) CD\nICP 038: Mary Oliver Witchfiddle CD\nICP 039: Tobias Delius 4 Tet Pelikanismus CD\nICP 040: ICP Orchestra Oh, My Dog!

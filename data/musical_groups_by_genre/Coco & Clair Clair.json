    "text": "Coco & Clair Clair are an American pop rap duo from suburban Atlanta, Georgia, founded by Taylor Nave and Claire Toothill in late 2013. Their debut album, Sexy, was released in November 2022, and their second album, Girl, was released in August 2024.\n\n\n== Career ==\nClaire Marie Toothill met Taylor Rose Nave, the grandniece of Taylor Dayne, on Twitter in late 2013, having followed her after seeing a picture of her at High Museum of Art posing with a statue, and bonded with each other in real life after hearing Drake's \"Marvins Room\" at a party, with both proceeding to scream the lyrics whilst traversing an empty street in Atlanta at two in the morning. Toothill was from Peachtree Corners, Georgia and Nave was from Alpharetta, Georgia. At the time, Nave was using the alias \"Coco\" after developing the alias for school announcements during her senior year of high school. The pair formed a band after asking Nave's then-boyfriend if they could freestyle over an unused beat, releasing the track online, and deciding to pursue music together.\nIn 2017, they released an EP, P.O.S.H., after which Toothill moved to New York City, followed by \"Pretty\", a song about self love, which was used without consent by Teen Vogue for content advertising the 2019 Acne Awards, prompting the duo to call the firm out on Twitter. Later in 2017, they released \"Crushcrushcrush\", a song about dating an unattractive man, and in September 2019, they appeared alongside Clairo on Deaton Chris Anthony's track \"Racecar\", a song about Clairo's juvenile idiopathic arthritis, for which a music video was released.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Toothill moved back to Atlanta after being fired, and Nave graduated from college. As a stopgap, they released the Treat Like Gold EP in April 2020, which contained \"Wishy Washy\", a song about spending a man's money, and for which a music video was released in September 2020 in which they loitered in front of a self-service laundry of the same name. In October 2022, the song was used in the fifth episode of the fourth season of Atlanta.\nIn December 2020, they released \"Pop Star\", an ode to life as a musician, followed by \"TBTF\" in September 2021, a song about looking flawless from the back and from the front. In February 2022, they featured on Lewis OfMan's \"Misbehave\", which Billboard likened to a version of Kesha's \"Tik Tok\" shot in the Emily in Paris universe, and which appeared on OfMan's album Sonic Poems, which was released the same day. In September 2022, the pair announced their debut album Sexy and released \"Cherub\", the first song they recorded for the album, and alongside a video shot on a camcorder; the following month, they released \"Love Me\", a song about wanting affection from someone they lack feelings for.\nThey released the twelve-track Sexy in November 2022, which featured \"Pop Star\", \"TBTF\", \"Cherub\", \"Love Me\", and \"The Hills (feat. Deela)\", the last of which was remixed by George Daniel in September 2023 for a deluxe version of the album released in November 2023. Also in November, they released a cover of Wham!'s \"Last Christmas\". They released the single \"Aggy\" and announced the album Girl in June 2024; the single was an appeal to stop being negative and start partying, while the band cited Saint Etienne, Brandy, Everything but the Girl, Lana Del Rey, Club 8, Milky, and Madonna as influencing the album. They released a further single, \"Kate Spade\" in July 2024, followed by Girl the month after.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\nPosh (May 2017)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nTreat Like Gold (April 2020)\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nSexy (November 2022)\nGirl (August 2024)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

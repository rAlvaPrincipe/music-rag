Their first EP was released in 2003 and a self titled full length album in 2005. Their name refers to the Starfish Prime nuclear test from 1962, the largest nuclear detonation in space.\n\n\n=== Music style ===\nTest Shot Starfish \"is the sound of space, if it had one â€“ at least in this parsec\". For example, their song \"LC-39A\" is inspired by the launch pad of the same name which launched Apollo, Space Shuttle, and Falcon Heavy.  Another example is on \"Sputnik\" which was named after the first artificial satellite. The song contained samples of news clips and the audio from the satellite itself. Their music is also commonly used in SpaceX's YouTube and X livestreams of rocket launches.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nTest Shot Starfish (2005)\nMusic for Space (2018)\nMusic for Space Sleep (2020)\nEarth Analog (2022)\nExtended plays\n\nTest Shot Starfish EP (2003)\nSingles\n\nMars (2019)\nCities in Flight (2019)\nThe New Astronauts (2020)\nCrew (2020)\nMoon (featuring Everyday Astronaut) (2021)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTest Shot Starfish official site\nTest Shot Starfish discography on MusicBrainz\nTest Shot Starfish SoundCloud"

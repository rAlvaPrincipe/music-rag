With sleazy basslines and mind-numbingly catchy hooks, Kids of 88 are all about poking tongues and making sweaty suggestive innuendos.\"\nThey cite their influences as \"Groove, mood, and slutty arrangements. 16th hi hats and hand claps. Culture and couture, Gangster and glamour\".\nMcCarthy is also a member of the band Goodnight Nurse.\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: Sugarpills and extended play ===\nIn April 2010, Kids of 88 signed a worldwide record deal with Sony Music.\nOn the back of their debut album release, Kids of 88 are set to tour New Zealand with fellow kiwi indie band The Naked and Famous, the tour will hit the four main centres of Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin beginning 30 September.\nAt the 2010 New Zealand Music Awards, Kids of 88 won 'Single of the Year' and (with Tim Van Dammen) 'Music Video of the Year' for their single \"Just a Little Bit\".\nIn November 2010 they toured Australia and in December 2010 they headed to Europe to support Ke$ha on her tour.\nIn February 2011 they released an EP which included the track \"Sugarpills\" and 4 other new ones.\nIn July 2011 they released an extended Sugarpills version to Australia and the United States known as Sugarpills (Australian Edition) which includes the track Sugarpills and two new songs from the EP released into New Zealand in February.\nOn 8 August 2011 episode of MTV's Teen Wolf entitled \"Formality\", they were featured as the live band performing at the Beacon Hills formal.

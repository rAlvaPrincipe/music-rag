It includes the singles \"Every Goliath Has Its David\", \"A Balloon On A Broken String\", \"When Life Gives Me Lemons I Make Lemonade\" and \"A Fairytale Ending\".\nIn December 2010, they released a seasonal album called Christmas Special, which included eight original compositions and three traditional festive songs.

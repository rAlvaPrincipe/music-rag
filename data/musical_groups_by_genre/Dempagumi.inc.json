    "text": "Dempagumi.inc (でんぱ組.inc, Denpagumi Inku) is a Japanese female idol group from Akihabara, Tokyo. Their music generally follows the style of denpa song. All of its members are said to be former otaku.\nThe group was formed in 2008 by producer Maiko Fukushima, and released one indie single before undergoing some member changes and being signed to Lantis and Toy's Factory. Since then, they have released several charting singles and albums, performed many concerts around the world, and appeared in several television shows and a 2013 film.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2007–2012: Formation, member flexibility era ===\n\nIn December 2007, producer Maiko Fukushima opened the live house/bar \"DearStage\" in the basement of a building near \nthe Suehirocho Station, and moved it to the DEMPA Building (DEMPAビル, DEMPABiru) in September 2008. In December 2008, DearStage salespeople Mirin Furukawa and Akari Owada formed the original Denpagumi (でんぱ組, Denpagumi) and released the single \"Mirror Magic?\" through an indie label. Fukushima said of the unit's name: \"I wanted to give it a retrotic name like Ushiroyubi Sasaregumi.\" Also, Kenzō Saeki and Masaya Koike, who participated in the naming conference at the time, said that the part of \"Dempa\" was taken from the Dempa Building.\nIn June 2009, Meme Nishimura (now Risa Aizawa) and Nemu Yumemi joined.\nTaking this opportunity, Fukushima considered changing Dempagumi's name to \"renew it to a new feeling\", and I will consult with Saeki. Saeki proposed \"Chapé's Fountain\"\n but Fukushima wanted to keep the Dempagumi name and said \"If it has an extension (a la MOSAIC.WAV, LOVE.EXE, etc.), it may be good for Akiba[hara].\" So was proposed that \".inc\" would be added, renaming it \"Dempagumi.inc\".\nVarious accounts vary about the reason \"inc\" was selected. The meaning of \"Dempagumi's evolutionary system\" was once considered. According to Saeki, it is absolutely necessary to avoid unit names ending in \"gumi\" because they will be a follow-up to the aforementioned Ushiroyubi Sasaregumi. Another reason is that \"it would be interesting \"inc\" was added to the end of a company [name]\".\nIn addition, according to Yumemi, \"The interpretation that Aizawa and Yumemi joined 'Dempagumi' and renamed it Dempagumi.inc is a little different.\" It is also said that it was four people of Furukawa, Owada, Aizawa, and Yumemu who happened to have passed, and it is said that it was something which was collected regardless of the original \"Dempagumi\". Although the original name is \"でんぱ組.inc\", the debut single released by Lantis mistakenly named them as \"でんぱ組inc.\"\nOn February 24, 2010, their debut single \"Kiss + Kiss de Owaranai\" with ULTRA-PRISM, which featured the music of the PC game \"Tropical KISS\", was released from Lantis. Eitaso and Miu Atobe joined on June 3, and Owada graduated on July 8. On August 15, Meme Nishimura was renamed Risa Aizawa, and on January 28, 2011, Eitaso was renamed Eimi Naruse. On July 6, the second single \"Piko Piku Pikatte Koishite yo\", Denpagumi.inc's first single release, was released from Lantis, and Aizawa became the group leader at the same time.\nOn September 9, they were transferred to MEME TOKYO, a label newly co-founded by Fukushima and Toy's Factory. Their third single Future Diver was released on November 16, and their first album, Nē Kīte? Uchuu wo Sukū no wa, Kitto Osushi... de wa Naku, Dempagumi.inc!, was released on December 14 by MEME TOKYO.

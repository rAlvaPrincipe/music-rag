They have released six studio albums. Their first independent studio album, Surf, was released in 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\nSurfaces was formed in 2017. Colin Padalecki began creating music in high school with his cousin and singer Alexa Padalecki. Colin began to upload his music online while attending Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. Forrest Frank, a recent Baylor University graduate from Texas, reached out to Colin after hearing his music and invited him to record music at his houseboat. They released their first album together under the moniker Surfaces in December 2017, entitled Surf. The album's third track, 24 / 7 / 365, has over 70 million streams on Spotify. After the release of Surf, Forrest Frank released a project with producer Biskwiq under the alias Forrest in July 2018. Notable tracks from the project include \"Your Soul\" and \"Why Not Me\", which have each amassed over 85 million combined streams on Spotify.\nIn January 2019, the band released their second album, Where the Light Is, under the labels Caroline Records and TenThousand Projects. The seventh track from the album, \"Sunday Best\", became a top 40 hit in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the top 100 in Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland. The song has amassed over 900 million streams on Spotify as of October 2023 and is believed to have gained its popularity from video-sharing app TikTok. It was released to radio in March 2020. A music video for the track was released on YouTube on July 10, 2019.\nTheir third album, Horizons, was released on February 28, 2020.

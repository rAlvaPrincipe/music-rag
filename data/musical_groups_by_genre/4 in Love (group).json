    "text": "4 in Love is a former Taiwanese all-female pop group. In 2000, BMG recruited four girls between the ages of 16 and 19, and named them 4 in Love. \nLing Chia-lin (冷嘉琳), Huang Hsiao-rou (黄小柔), Yang Cheng-lin (杨丞琳), and Chang Chi-huey (张棋惠) were each given new names based on different weather types: Cloudie, Sunnie, Rainie, and Windie, respectively. The label's strategy for the group was to promote their doll-like voices, and market them as \"The World's First 3D Group\". \nThe music video for their first lead single, \"Fall in Love\", was a first in the Taiwanese music industry for its use of three-dimensional computer animations. In 2001, their second and last album, Who's Afraid of Whom?, earned them a Silver Award in the Most Adored Artiste category at the Malaysian Golden Melody Awards. \nAlthough Rainie's appearance in the hit drama Meteor Garden raised the group's profile, 4 in Love's popularity was still questionable at best. At the group's first autograph session, only a handful of fans had showed up. Their songs, with the exception of \"1001 Wishes\" (一千零一個願望), were rarely successful on music charts. In 2002, the group was disbanded as investment in their label was pulled after the 1999 Jiji earthquake and the all artistes under the label were terminated from their contracts.\nOn 25 February 2018, the group reunited and performed at Rainie's concert as a special guest.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nFall In Love (November 27, 2000)\n誰怕誰 Who's Afraid of Whom?

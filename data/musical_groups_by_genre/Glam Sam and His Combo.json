    "text": "Glam Sam and His Combo is an electronic music project by Mats Samuelsson from Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n\n== History ==\nMats Samuelsson, born in 1965 in Link√∂ping, first played in an indie-jazz pop duo and then went back to university. Later on he has been working as journalist and free author. In 2008 he developed the idea of Glam Sam and His Combo as a jazzy-funky music project with himself acting as Glam Sam. The debut Groovy was released at Lemongrassmusic in 2009. \nThe German label discovered the Swedish producer and signed him immediately. The longplayer which unites elements of jazz, funk, rock, hip hop techno and disco sounds has received good critiques.\nAfter the release of the single \"The Last Days of Disco\", the second album The Paradise Groove was released in summer 2010 placing particular emphasis on serving the dancefloor. Critiques in many countries were all positive.\nIn January 2012, the EP The Riviera Sessions was released, containing more jazz and downtempo elements than the previous releases.  Several EP releases followed, as well as a greatest hits compilation and then, in 2015, a new album called Stockholm City Soul emerged. Mr Glam Sam continued to release singles in the following years but focused more on his fiction writing.\nIn the beginning of 2023 he entered his Coolsville Sounds Studio again to produce tracks for his comeback. The cool and jazzy groove of Lost In The Art World was released on 10 March and immediately got airplay on quality soul and jazz stations in England such as Solar Radio and Jazz FM. The year of 2023 saw several new releases from the producer, and in january 2024 he released the jazzy dance-floor groove \"The Challenge\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2009: Groovy!

    "text": "Super Junior-M (an initialism for Super Junior-Mandarin, also known as SJ-M), is the third sub-unit of the South Korean boy band Super Junior focusing on Chinese market, currently composed of six Super Junior members Sungmin, Eunhyuk, Siwon, Donghae, Ryeowook, Kyuhyun and special member Zhou Mi. The sub-unit is known as the first international music group in the Chinese music industry to have members of both Chinese and Korean descent. The sub-unit has released two studio albums and three EP’s since their debut.\nFormed in 2008, Super Junior-M became the third and most successful subgroup branched off from the Korean band Super Junior. The group was originally composed of seven members: leader Han Geng, Donghae, Siwon, Ryeowook, Kyuhyun and two additional members appearing exclusively to the subgroup, Zhou Mi and Henry. In December 2009, Han Geng filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment and decided to leave the main group and sub-group, resulting in the sub-group's temporary disbandment.\nAfter a year-long hiatus, the group returned with additional Super Junior members Eunhyuk and Sungmin, following with the released of their second EP Perfection in February 2011. Following Han Geng's departure, Sungmin was speculations as the new \"leader\", as he is the oldest member of the team.\nFollowing the Korean members military service enlistment in 2015, the sub-unit promotions and activity were halted. In April 2018, Special member Henry left the sub-unit following his contract expiration with SM.\n\n\n== Name ==\nBefore the official name of the subgroup was released, they were known by \"Super Junior China\". On April 3, 2008, SM Entertainment announced their official name to be Super Junior-M, with \"M\" representing the word \"Mandarin\". The \"M\" can also represent a list of other aspects, such as the first letter of their debut album Me, and also \"mí\" (Chinese: 迷), the pinyin for \"charismatic\" and \"fan\", the latter meaning referring to their desire to connect closer with fans.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2007: Formation and controversies ===\nIn October 2007, SM Entertainment announced that a new Super Junior subgroup would debut in China in 2008. Super Junior's original member Han Geng, and a new member Henry Lau, who performed the violin solo of Super Junior's \"Don't Don\", were announced to be the first two of seven members representing the subgroup. Some of Super Junior's official fanclub, E.L.F, signed online petitions and held protests to express their dissatisfaction and opposition of adding a fourteenth member to the group, fearing that a new member would mean one of the original lineup would get 'replaced'. Many fans boycotted Super Junior's products and held silent protests in front of SM Entertainment's main building in Seoul, holding signs of the \"Only 13\" slogan.\nOver one thousand fans appeared in front of the SM Entertainment building on E.L.F's third protest on November 3, 2007. Instead of a silent protest, the fans sang various Super Junior songs and shouted \"thirteen.\" Fans purchased 58,206 stocks of SM Entertainment, holding 0.3% of the company's entire stock. They released a statement through the media, stating that they would obtain all chances to prevent SM Entertainment from adding new members and to keep Super Junior as only thirteen. SM Entertainment later announced that they would not add the new subgroup members to the main group.\n\n\n=== 2008–2009: Debut and commercial success ===\nFrom April 4 to April 7, 2008, the seven members of Super Junior-M were individually announced to the Chinese media in a chain of short trailer clips.

    "text": "Home Made Kazoku (HOME MADE 家族, literally \"Home Made Family\") is a Japanese hip hop trio from Nagoya, formed in 1996. They are signed to Ki/oon Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music. The group has been on hiatus since 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\nHome Made Kazoku is a trio consisting of members Micro, Kuro, and DJ U-Ichi. The band was originally formed in 1996 the name Hoze Kuro Sambo (HOZE KURO サンボ) as part of the hip-hop group Funhouse. Micro joined the group in 1999 and Hoze left in 2001 to form the duo HB, with the remaining members renaming the band to Home Made Kazoku.\nVocalists Micro and Kuro are originally from the United States. Micro spent a portion of his childhood in Kentucky, while Kuro stated that he lived in the U.S. until he was twelve in Chicago, Illinois.\nFrom 2001 to 2003, the band performed in various Nagoya nightclubs. Shortly after being signed on through local radio station Zip-FM, the trio released the album Home Sweet Home, from which its similarly titled song became one of the most requested songs on Japanese radio stations for the rest of the year.\nIn early 2004, the band was chosen to be part of a country-wide tour known as the Japan Club Tour. During the tour, the trio gained a large portion of their Japanese fanbase, and were also signed on by the recording company, Ki/oon Records. The trio made their major debut with the release of their mini-album Oooh! Yeah! (Oooh! 家～!, Oooh! Iē!). In July 2004, Home Made Kazoku released their first single, Summer Time Magic, which ranked 15th on the Oricon record charts for nearly 10 weeks.\nAfter a series of singles, including Thank You!!, which was used as the second ending theme for the anime Bleach, and Shōnen Heart, as well as the second opening theme for the anime Eureka Seven, the band's first full-length album was released \"Rock the World\". \"Rock the World\" entered the Oricon charts. The record was in fifth place on the Oricon chart for its first week, and would stay in top 20 for the next eight weeks. Rock the World sold 191,744 copies and became the 78th best selling album of 2005.\nAfter their first album, the group went on several tours and concomitantly released several singles. They also released their second and third albums, \"Musication\" and \"Familia\".\nOf special note, tickets to their second tour were sold out within the span of one hour, a record in Japanese music. In January 2007, it was announced that they would perform the first ending theme to the anime Naruto Shippūden entitled Nagareboshi Shooting Star which entered the Oricon charts at 10th place. One of the member, Micro, was featured on the Abingdon Boys School song \"Lost Reason\" as it appeared on their self-titled album.\nHome Made Kazoku has performed for a promotional commercial for a product called \"Walky Walky\" with their song \"Easy Walk\". In addition, Home Made Kazoku's single, No Rain No Rainbow, is the movie theme for the second Naruto Shippūden movie.\nIn 2011, Home Made Kazoku returned to Naruto Shippūden for the third time with the song \"FREEDOM\", which was the 17th ending theme.\nThe band played their first show in the US at Otakon 2010 in Baltimore, MD, and returned for Otakon 2013 alongside T.M. Revolution.\nTheir official blog stated in August 2016 that the trio will go on indefinite hiatus by the end of the year. According to the comment by group member Micro, the group is taking a hiatus to \"grow individually and take on new challenges.\" The group's members have since been pursuing solo careers, including DJ U-Ichi's work on his YouTube channel and Kuro working with former member Hoze on the soul group Enband.\n\n\n== Style ==\nHome Made Kazoku usually displays a very up-beat mood in their music, sometimes described by fans as \"feel-good music\". The pace of the songs may vary from moderately slow and calm to moderately fast and energetic. Following a trend within Japanese pop, the group makes use of English phrases within the music. This use is rather extensive, as nearly every song contains some amount of English. Most songs utilize the language in the refrain as well as in isolated instances throughout a song.\nThe subject matter of the music usually concerns love, family, peace, harmonious communication with others, fun, and summer festivities. Additionally, most of the music videos seem to take place in the spring or summer, hearkening back to their up-beat mood and liveliness.\nWhen asked what they want listeners to take away from hearing their music, they responded saying that no matter where you come from or the color of your skin, we are all one big family. When asked which American artist they would most like to collaborate with, the group showed interest primarily in hip-hop and pop artists. Micro would most like to work with The Black Eyed Peas, Kuro with Stevie Wonder and U-ICHI with Jay-Z.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nH.M.K.U (2001)\nMainichi ga Eiga no you na Hitokoma ～Life Is Beautiful～(2002)\nHome Sweet Home (2004)\nRock the World (May 11, 2005)\nmusication (February 15, 2006)\nFamilia (March 14, 2007)\nHome (October 8, 2008)\nCircle (March 3, 2010)\nAKATSUKI (September 28, 2011)\n3RISE (September 12, 2012)\nLaughin' Road (February 11, 2015)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nHeartful Best Songs (February 6, 2008)\nThank You!!

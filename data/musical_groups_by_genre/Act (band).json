    "text": "Act were a short-lived synth-pop group signed to ZTT Records in the late 1980s, and comprising Scottish musician Thomas Leer and German ex-Propaganda vocalist Claudia Br√ºcken. Besides synthpop and disco, the group were also influenced by psychedelic rock and musical theatre. Lyrically, their songs tended to be concerned with decadence and moral bankruptcy.

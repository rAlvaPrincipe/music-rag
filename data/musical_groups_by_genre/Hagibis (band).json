    "text": "Hagibis (Filipino word meaning \"velocity\", \"speed\" or 'swiftness\") is a Filipino disco group best known for their macho image, on-stage costumes, and macho songs about women. Originally formed by Juan dela Cruz Band singer and bassist Mike Hanopol and Vic del Rosario, they are cited as the \"first boyband in the Philippines\" and later were called the \"Village People of the Philippines\", a title they still hold to this day. Their original line-up was composed of Sonny Parsons, Bernie Fineza, Mike Respall, Joji Garcia and Mon Picazo.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to Mike Hanopol, who composed almost all of Hagibis' tracks, Vic del Rosario wanted to recruit famous actors and singers for the new group, but later changed his mind, and instead, they recruited unknown musicians. Hanopol also revealed in the same interview that he also sung the band's recorded songs himself. Sonny Parsons said during Hagibis' guest appearance on Tonight with Arnold Clavio that he originally auditioned for VST & Co. before joining Hagibis. The group borrowed some elements of the American disco group Village People, such as the line dancing, leather clothing, and accompaniment of motorcycles.\nIn 1980, the film Dolphy's Angels was released which contained a musical number by Hagibis.\nTony Ferrer's directorial debut, the musical film Legs... Katawan... Babae! which premiered on July 2, 1981, was a film vehicle for the group. The film co-stars Myrna Castillo, Laarni Enriquez, Dinah Dominguez, and Val Iglesias. That same year in Lito Lapid's Macho Gigolo, Hagibis performed its theme song.\nGroup member Sonny Parsons would go on to be a director and action star in the film industry.\nThe new lineup of Hagibis appeared on Tonight with Arnold Clavio in 2014 with Sonny Parsons, Mike Respall, Carlos Parsons and Pete Gatela. \nOriginal member Bernie Fineza died on January 15, 2015, and another original member, Sonny Parsons, died on May 10, 2020. Currently, Joel Ortega Singer/Actor Yujin Baydal Singer/Actor  \nPete Gatela and Carlos Nabiula are the official and active members of Hagibis. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n1994: Katawan\n2012: OPM Back to Back Hits (with VST & Co.)\n\n\n=== Songs ===\n\"Lalake\"\n\"Katawan\" (1979) (former theme song of the popular comedy show Palibhasa Lalake from 1987 to 1998 on ABS-CBN 2; also covered by Parokya Ni Edgar in 2002's Edgar Edgar Musikahan)\n\"Legs\" (1979)\n\"Babae\"\n\"Ilagay Mo Kid\"\n\"Nanggigigil\" (1979) (also covered by TNT Boys in 2018 & iDolls in 2021)\n\"Mama Monchang\"\n\"Mandurugas\"\n\"Maginoo\"\n\"G.R.O.\"\n\"Hard to Let You Go\"\n\"A Feeling Just for You\"\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n1981: Legs, Katawan, Babae\n\n\n== See also ==\nManila sound\n\n\n== References =="

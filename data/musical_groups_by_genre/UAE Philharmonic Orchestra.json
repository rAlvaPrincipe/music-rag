    "text": "The UAE Philharmonic Orchestra is an orchestra based in the United Arab Emirates.\nAfter being inactive for several years, the orchestra was relaunched in 2024 by BACKART Production under the baton of conductor Nicolas Mann.\nRebranded as \"UAE Phil.\" it became the first orchestra in the UAE to offer a full yearly concert season, performing a diverse repertoire ranging from Baroque masterpieces to 20th-century works.\nThe orchestra is noted for its multicultural ensemble, featuring musicians from 17 different countries, reflecting Dubai's cultural diversity and inclusivity.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe UAE Philharmonic Orchestra was originally founded by Philipp Maier, who served as its first conductor and artistic director.\nIt was active between 2006 and 2012 in the United Arab Emirates, primarily performing in Dubai. \nInitially known as the Dubai Philharmonic Orchestra (DPO), it was renamed in 2007 to reflect its broader representation of musicians from across the UAE.  \nThe UAE Philharmonic Orchestra consisted of around 70 volunteer amateur and professional musicians resident in the UAE, and performed regularly at private events, public concerts and corporate functions.\nIts repertory included both European classical music and specially commissioned works influenced by both European and Arabic musical traditions. During its first existence The UAEPO was the only permanent orchestra in the UAE.\nPerformances in early 2007 were claimed to be well-attended and successful. However, in 2012, Meier resigned and announced the end of the UAEPO, blaming a lack of both public and private sector support. \n\n\n=== Relaunch ===\nIn September 2024, the UAE Philharmonic Orchestra was revived after a 12-year hiatus, with BACKART Production overseeing its relaunch and a new identity under the name \"UAE Phil.\".\nNicolas Mann was appointed as the orchestra's chief conductor and artistic director, bringing with him extensive international experience, including performances at prominent venues such as the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and collaborations with Grammy Award-winning artists.\nThe inaugural concert of the re-established UAE Phil took place at the Theatre of Digital Arts (TODA) in Dubai, marking the official beginning of its new concert season. The event was attended by UAE officials, members of the press, and notable cultural figures.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of symphony orchestras\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

    "text": "Codeseven is a melodic post-hardcore band from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Formed in 1995, their first \"official\" release (their actual first release was called Paper or Plastic [1996], released through a small Winston-Salem-based label called Huel Records), A Sense of Coalition (1998) gained popularity on college radio stations for a cover of Don Henley's \"The Boys of Summer\" (not to be confused with The Ataris' cover of the same song that became a mainstream radio hit years later).\nWith the milestone release, Division of Labor (1999), Codeseven found themselves at the forefront of the hardcore movement. With the departure of singer David Owen, they released The Rescue (2002). This album saw the band becoming less aggressive and more melodic, largely abandoning their hardcore roots in favor of progressive, experimental space rock as Cave In had done. Their final album, Dancing Echoes/Dead Sounds, was released in 2004 on Equal Vision Records. The following year the band broke up in order to pursue different opportunities.\nIt was announced on July 1, 2010, that Codeseven would be playing a reunion show on August 20, 2010, at Greene Street Club in Greensboro, NC.  Following an overwhelmingly positive response, it was decided that they would continue to tour.  On August 2, 2010, it was announced the band would support Circa Survive alongside Dredg and Animals as Leaders on a tour starting October 15, 2010.\nThe set at their reunion show on August 20, 2010, featured songs from all four of their most recent albums including 6 songs with original 2nd vocalist Dave Owen.  Many of these songs had not been played in close to 10 years.  The set closed with their cover of Don Henley's \"The Boys of Summer.\"\nIn October 2023, the band announced a new single titled \"Hold Tight\" off of their newly announced upcoming record titled \"Go Let It In\" set to release December 1, 2023, via Equal Vision Records. \"Hold Tight\" was released with a subsequent video supporting the release.\nNovember 30, 2023, the day before the release of the record, a second single \"Rough Seas\" was released with a supporting video.\nIn a recent interview with Metal Injection the band states; \"with this new record, we tackled what we considered the ultimate challenge: to write and record a full length that sounds as good, if not better, than the last record,\" said Codeseven. \"Following a 20-year hiatus, this felt like it could be impossible. It's hard to beat time and nostalgia but we certainly wanted to try. And yes, we think we did.\"\n\"Go Let It In\" was released on December 1.\nOn May 03, 2024 they embarked on a US tour in support of He Is Legend's 20 year anniversary tour for their 2004 album I Am Hollywood. \n\n\n== Discography ==\nPaper or Plastic (Huel Records, 1996)\nA Sense of Coalition (The Music Cartel, 1998)\nDivision of Labor (1999)\nThe Rescue (The Music Cartel, 2002)\nDancing Echoes/Dead Sounds (Equal Vision Records, 2004)\nGo Let It In (Equal Vision Records, 2023)\n\n\n== Related bands ==\nAdair – Matt Tuttle\nTelescreen – James Tuttle, Jon Tuttle, Matt Tuttle, Eric Weyer\nSundrone – Jeff Jenkins\nRed Orchestra Radio – James Tuttle\n18 Wheels of Pain – Dave Owen\nEcho Crush – James Tuttle\nSmall Planes – Matt Tuttle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCodeseven Returns After Two Decades With New Single & Album - Metal Injection\nCodeseven on Myspace\nCodeseven on MusicIsMyDrug.com"

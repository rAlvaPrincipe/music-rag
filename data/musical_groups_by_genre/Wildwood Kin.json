    "text": "Wildwood Kin are an English folk rock band, composed of sisters Beth Key and Emillie Whiteside, from Exeter, Devon, England. They released their first album, Turning Tides, in August 2017. They released their self-titled second album in October 2019, featuring the smash hit \"Beauty In Your Brokenness\", a song inspired by the Japanese art of kintsugi. Wildwood Kin appeared on Channel 4's Sunday Brunch in September 2019.\nTheir cousin Meghann Loney was a part of the band at the start of their career and recorded with the band for their first two albums but left the band in November 2022.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBefore they officially formed as a band, Beth, Emillie and Meghann would harmonise to everything that was in earshot, from songs on the radio, TV jingles, adverts to even the doorbell. They soon found their signature style with Emillie playing guitar, Beth playing the bouzouki or keyboard and Meghann playing the drums. They all join forces for harmonies and take turns on lead vocals. The band credit musical influences such as Simon & Garfunkel, Fleetwood Mac and James Taylor, as well as newer acts such as Mumford & Sons, Ben Howard, Fleet Foxes, Sigur Ros and The Civil Wars.\nThey played their first gig at an open mic night at Stokeinteignhead’s Church House Inn to around 60 people. This was where they caught the attention of their future management. Their career then developed quickly and in 2017 they released their debut album, Turning Tides, via Sony Music's imprint label Silvertone. The band spent much of 2017 touring playing a number of UK and European festivals over the summer, including an appearance with Seth Lakeman at Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park and on the BBC Music Introducing Stage at Glastonbury.\nIn describing the band, The Sunday Times noted \"Fleetwood Mac-like harmonies, hints of Fleet Foxes’ desolate, spectral acoustica, echoes of Ben Howard’s richly textured but ramshackle sparseness, a love of Mumford-like propulsion and explosiveness.\"\nThey released a cover of \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\" on the 21 of December 2017.\nIn 2018, they performed their single \"Steady My Heart\" along with \"Taking A Hold\" on the one-off revival special of The Old Grey Whistle Test with Bob Harris.\nIn July 2019, they announced their second, self-titled album, alongside lead single \"Never Alone\", written with and produced by Ed Harcourt. The rest of the album, produced by Ian Grimble, addresses profound themes like love, loss and spirituality. After a UK headline tour to support the album release, Wildwood Kin toured through Europe with the acclaimed indie rock-folk band Boy & Bear.\nThroughout 2022, the band would hint at new music being recorded and played some new songs on their UK tour that year which was supported by the band Jackal. However during the Cardiff show at the acepella studio Jackal could not be present and so Beth asked her friend singer songwriter RemyCB to perform that night in their place.\nOn 5 November 2022, they announced on their social medias that Meghann would be leaving the band to spend more time at home. Their final show together was on 17 December 2022, at Phoenix Hall in their home city of Exeter.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Wildwood Kin at Wikimedia Commons"

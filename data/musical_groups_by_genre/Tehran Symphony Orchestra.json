    "text": "The Tehran Symphony Orchestra (TSO, Persian: ارکستر سمفونیک تهران), founded in 1933, is Iran's oldest and largest symphony orchestra. It was founded as the Municipality Symphony Orchestra by Gholamhossein Minbashian, before entering its modern form under Parviz Mahmoud in 1946. In the years that followed, conductors such as Rubik (Ruben) Gregorian, Morteza Hannaneh, Haymo Taeuber, Heshmat Sanjari, and Farhad Meshkat took over as the conductors of the orchestra.\nAfter the 1979 Revolution, many musicians of the TSO emigrated to Europe and the US. For some years Heshmat Sanjari and then Fereydoun Nasseri were the conductors. The current conductor of TSO is Manouchehr Sahbai.\n\n\n== 1933–1979 ==\n\nIn the golden age of the orchestra, many notable musicians like Yehudi Menuhin and Isaac Stern played with the orchestra.\n\n\n== 1979–present ==\nAfter the 1979 Iranian revolution, clerics outlawed all pre-revolutionary music, hardline clerics say music comes between the faithful and God, and leads to an impure mind. As a result, the orchestra faced its darkest age, playing only a few concerts in the decade following the revolution. The pressure caused the conductor Heshmat Sanjari a serious sickness, he died in 1995.\nThe orchestra still plays concerts once in a while.\n\n\n== Principal conductors ==\n\nParviz Mahmoud (1946–1948)\nRouben Gregorian (1948–1951)\nMorteza Hannaneh (1952–1954)\nHaymo Taeuber (1957–1960)\nHeshmat Sanjari (1960–1971)\nFarhad Meshkat (1972–1978)\nBijan Ghaderi (1980–1982)\nNader Mortezapour (1982–1984)\nFereydoun Nasseri (1990–1994)\nAli Rahbari (2004–2005)\nNader Mashayekhi (2006–2007)\nManouchehr Sahbai (2007–2010)\nAlexander Rahbari (2015–2016)\nShahrdad Rohani (2016–2020)\nWolfgang Wengenroth (guest conductor 2022)\nNassir Heidarian-Rasty (2022–2023)\nManouchehr Sahbai (2023–present)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMusic of Iran\nIranian Orchestra for New Music\nIran's Children Orchestra\nIran's National Orchestra\nOpera Orchestra of Dushanbe\nSymphonic music in Iran\n\n\n== References =="

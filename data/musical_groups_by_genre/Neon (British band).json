All members went on to have successful careers in other bands, notably Naked Eyes and Tears for Fears.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band were formed in 1979 in Bath, Somerset by Pete Byrne and Rob Fisher. They were then joined by Neil Taylor and Manny Elias, and then Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal as session musicians, who at the time were in the band Graduate. The band's first single, \"Making Waves\"/\"Me I See in You\", was released in October 1980 on Byrne and Fisher's own label, 3D Music, followed by \"Communication Without Sound\"/\"Remote Control\" in July 1981 on Carrere UK.

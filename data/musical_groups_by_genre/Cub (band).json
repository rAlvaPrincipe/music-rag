    "text": "Cub (also stylized cub) was an indie pop band from Vancouver, British Columbia, that formed in 1992 and disbanded in 1997. They played a melodic, jangly form of pop punk they called \"cuddlecore\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was emblematic of the twee pop and cuddlecore style. At their cozy, casual live shows, they sometimes played in their pajamas, and gave out presents to audience members.\nThe group's original drummer, Valeria Fellini, was replaced by Lisa G. in 1994.\nNeko Case played drums on some early recordings and on tour in later years. Notably, she sang live in front of an audience for the first time ever during a cub show in Ohio, singing the song \"So Far Apart\". Years later she would go on to form her own all-female three piece Vancouver band, Maow.\nAfter the group's dissolution, Robynn Iwata co-formed I Am Spoonbender in 1997 in San Francisco. Lisa Marr and Lisa G. started Buck in 1998 after moving to California from their native Vancouver.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles/EPs ===\nPep (1992) Mint Records MRS-003.

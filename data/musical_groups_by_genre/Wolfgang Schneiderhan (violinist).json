At age 10 he publicly performed Bach's Chaconne in D minor. The next year he made his debut in Copenhagen playing the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto. He lived in England for some time from 1929, where he appeared in concerts with artists such as Maria Jeritza, Feodor Chaliapin, Jan Kiepura and Paul Robeson.\nHe returned to Vienna to become the first Concertmaster of the Vienna Symphony Orchestra from 1933 to 1937, and from 1937 to 1951 led the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

In 1956 he founded the Lucerne Festival Strings together with Rudolf Baumgartner. He gave the 1959 premiere of his friend Karl Amadeus Hartmann's revised Concerto funebre.\n\n\n== Family ==\nSchneiderhan was married to the soprano Irmgard Seefried from 1948 until her death in 1988; they had three daughters together, including actress Mona Seefried (born 1957), who uses her mother's maiden name professionally.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHe died in his native Vienna in 2002, ten days before his 87th birthday.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIndependent obituary\nTelegraph obituary\nPhoto, 1970 Wolfgang Schneiderhan on Southern Africa Tour dedicated to tour organiser Hans Adler.[1]"

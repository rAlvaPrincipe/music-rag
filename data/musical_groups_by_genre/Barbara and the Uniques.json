    "text": "Barbara and the Uniques was a 1960s and 1970s R&B girl group.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group began when the Du-ettes, a group from Chicago featuring Barbara Livsey and her cousin, Mary Hayes, was liquidated in 1965. Barbara got together with her sister Gwen Livsey and a friend, Doris Lindsey, and released the soul ballad \"There It Goes Again\" (written by Eugene Record of The Chi-Lites) as Barbara and the Uniques in 1970. The song was very successful at the local level, causing Arden Records to distribute it nationally. The song became an R&B hit, reaching #16 on the R&B charts. It was a minor US Billboard Hot 100 hit, where it reached #91.\nThe group followed up with two singles on the Arden label in 1971: \"You're Gonna Make Me Cheat on You\" / \"I'll Never Let You Go\" and \"You Make Me Feel So Young Again\" / \"Take Me As I Am\". In 1972, the group moved to Abbot Records and released \"He's Gone\", which also featured \"Take Me As I Am\" as the B-side.\nGwen and Doris quit the group and were replaced with male session singers.  Now dubbed Barbara Blake and the Uniques on 20th Century Records, in 1974, they released \"Prized Possession\" / \"It's Not That Easy\" and \"Teach Me\" / \"Everlasting Thrill\".  Both releases failed to make an impact, but still the group's eponymous LP was released in 1975.  A 1975 single, \"Need Your Love So Bad\" / \"Let Me Down Easy\", also was not a chart hit.\nThe band broke up when their contract with 20th Century Records expired.\nThe Du-Ettes' regional hit song “Every Beat Of My Heart” has been featured in a Whole Foods market television commercial.\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Sault (frequently stylised as SAULT) are a British music collective that make a mixture of R&B, urban contemporary gospel, house and disco. The project is helmed by songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer Inflo, and includes vocalists Cleo Sol, Kid Sister, and Chronixx. Jack Peñate has also collaborated with the collective. The group frequently puts Black-centric issues at the foreground.\nDuring its first three years, Sault released five studio albums including 5 (2019), 7 (2019), Untitled (Black Is) (2020), Untitled (Rise) (2020), and Nine (2021). Throughout 2022, after releasing the orchestral instrumental album Air, the collective surprise-released five subsequent studio albums, simultaneously. Following their first live performance in November 2023, Sault is due to perform international live shows in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2019: 5 and 7 ===\nOn 15 February 2019, Sault released their debut track \"We Are the Sun\" via their record label Forever Living Originals; this was followed in March 2019 by \"Don't Waste My Time\".\nIn May 2019, Sault released their debut album, 5. In September 2019, Sault released their second album, 7.\n\n\n=== 2020–2021: Untitled albums ===\nSault's albums in 2020, Untitled (Black Is), released in June, and Untitled (Rise), released in September, both received universal critical acclaim, including a nomination for the Mercury Prize in 2021 for the latter.\nIn June 2021, the band released their fifth studio album Nine. Between their 2019 debut and late 2023, they had never played a live show, given an interview or released a music video in support of their music and first teased a live performance in November 2023.\n\n\n=== 2022–present: surprise albums, and tour ===\nIn April 2022, Sault released their sixth studio album Air. The Guardian described it as a \"total volte-face\" and Pitchfork described it as \"a sharp pivot to lush contemporary classical\". In October that same year, the collective released a reggae-influenced EP 10, consisting of one ten-minute-long song \"Angel\".\nIn November 2022, the collective surprise-released five albums simultaneously as a free download via WeTransfer, writing: \"Here are 5 albums released as an offering to God. Available for free download for five days. The password to unlock all 5 albums is in the message. Love SAULT X.\" The five individual albums 11, AIIR, Earth, Today & Tomorrow, and Untitled (God), feature 56 tracks in total. Variety suggested this as \"the largest amount of newly recorded music released by a relatively major artist at once.\" In May 2023, 11 won the Ivor Novello Award for \"Best Album\", with producer Inflo, vocalists Cleo Sol and Chronixx, and musician Jack Peñate as recipients of the award.\nIn November 2023, the group announced their first live performance, teasing that they would play an unreleased album of material. They later elaborated that they would play seven shows that featured live performances of music from different albums. The tour was initiated on 14 December in London, and featured songs from an at the time unreleased album Acts of Faith. Subsequent dates are to include international locations in 2024: New York City (5), London (Nine), Los Angeles (Black Is), Canada (Untitled Rise), Germany (11), Paris (Air), and Africa (Earth).\nA collaboration with André 3000 was also announced in early 2024.\n\n\n== Members ==\nInflo – piano, keyboards, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass, vocals, production, engineering\nCleo Sol – lead vocals\nKid Sister – lead vocals\nChronixx – lead vocals\nAt their first live performance, guests and members included Inflo, Cleo Sol, Michael Kiwanuka, and Little Simz.

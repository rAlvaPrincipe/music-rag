    "text": "The Count Basie Orchestra is a 16- to 18-piece big band, one of the most prominent jazz performing groups of the swing era, founded by Count Basie in 1935 and recording regularly from 1936. Despite a brief disbandment at the beginning of the 1950s, the band survived long past the big band era itself and the death of Basie in 1984. It continues under the direction of trumpeter Scotty Barnhart.\nOriginally including such musicians as Buck Clayton and Lester Young in the line-up, the band in the 1950s and 1960s made use of the work of the arrangers Neal Hefti and Sammy Nestico with featured musicians such as Thad Jones and Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nCount Basie arrived in Kansas City, Missouri in 1927, playing on the Theater Owners Booking Association (TOBA) circuit. After playing with Walter Page's Blue Devils, in 1929 he joined rival band leader Bennie Moten's band.\nUpon Moten's death in 1935, Basie left the group to start his own band, taking many of his colleagues from the Moten band with him. This nine-piece group was known for its legendary soloists including, Joe Keyes and Oran 'Hot Lips' Page on trumpet, Buster Smith and Earle Warren on alto saxophone, Lester Young on tenor saxophone, Dan Minor on trombone, and a rhythm section made up of Jo Jones on drums, Walter Page on bass and Basie on piano. With this band, then named The Barons of Rhythm, Basie brought the sound of the famous and highly competitive Kansas City \"jam session\" to club audiences, coupling extended improvised solos with riff-based accompaniments from the band. The group's first venue was the Reno Club in Kansas City, later moving to the Grand Terrace in Chicago.\nWhen music critic and record producer John Hammond heard the band on a 1936 radio broadcast, he sought them out and offered Basie the chance to expand the group to the standard 13-piece big band line-up. He also offered to transfer the group to New York City in order to play at venues such as the Roseland Ballroom. Basie agreed, hoping that with this new band, he could retain the freedom and spirit of the Kansas City style of his nine-piece group.\nThe band, which now included Buck Clayton on trumpet and the famous blues \"shouter\" Jimmy Rushing, demonstrated this style in their first recordings with the Decca label in January 1937: in pieces such as \"Roseland Shuffle\", the soloists are at the foreground, with the ensemble effects and riffs playing a strictly functional backing role. This was a fresh big band sound for New York, contrasting the complex jazz writing of Duke Ellington and Sy Oliver and highlighting the difference in styles that had emerged between the east and west coasts.\n\n\n=== New York City ===\nFollowing the first recording session, the band's line up was reshuffled, with some of players being replaced on the request of Hammond as part of a strengthening of the band. Trumpeters Ed Lewis and Bobby Moore replaced Keyes and Smith, and Earle Warren replaced the alto saxophonist Coughey Roberts.  In March 1937 the guitarist Freddie Green arrived, replacing Claude Williams and completing what became one of the most respected rhythm sections in big band history. Billie Holiday also sang with the band during this period, although she never recorded with them for contractual reasons.\nHits such as \"One O'Clock Jump\" and \"Jumpin' at the Woodside\" (from 1937 and 1938, respectively) helped to gain the band, now known as the Count Basie Orchestra, national and international fame. These tunes were known as \"head-arrangements\"; not scored in individual parts but made up of riffs memorized by the band's members. Although some of the band's players, such as trombonist Eddie Durham, contributed their own written arrangements at this time, the \"head-arrangements\" captured the imagination of the audience in New York and communicated the spirit of the band's members.\nIn 1938, Helen Humes joined the group, replacing Billie Holiday as the female singer. She sang mostly pop ballads, including \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\" and \"Blame it on My Last Affair\", acting as a gentle contrast to the blues style of Jimmy Rushing.\n\n\n=== 1940s ===\nThe band became increasingly dependent on arrangers to provide its music. These varied from players within the band, such as Eddie Durham and Buck Clayton, to professional arrangers from outside the group, who could bring their own character to the band with each new piece. External arranger Andy Gibson brought the band's harmonic style closer to the music of Duke Ellington, with arrangements from 1940 such as \"I Never Knew\" and \"Louisiana\" introducing increased chromaticism to the band's music. Tab Smith contributed important arrangements at this time, such as \"Harvard Blues\", and others including Buster Harding and veteran arranger Jimmy Mundy also expanded the group's repertoire. Thelma Carpenter replaced Helen Humes as the new female vocalist, notably recording \"I Didn't Know About You\" for Columbia Records.\nBut the many new arrangements led to a gradual change in the band's sound, distancing the group musically from its Kansas City roots. Rather than the music being built around the soloists with memorised head arrangements and riffs, the group's sound at this time became more focused on ensemble playing; closer to the East Coast big band sound. This can be attributed to the increasing reliance on arrangers to influence the band with their music. It suggested that Basie's ideal of a big band-sized group with the flexibility and spirit of his original Kansas City eight-piece was not to last.\nDuring the World War II years, some of the key members of the band left: the drummer Jo Jones and tenor saxophone player Lester Young were both conscripted in 1944, leading to the hiring of drummers such as Buddy Rich and extra tenor saxophonists, including Illinois Jacquet, Paul Gonsalves and Lucky Thompson. The musicologist Gunther Schuller has said that when Jo Jones left, he took some of the smooth, relaxed style of the band with him. Replacements such as Sonny Payne, drummed much louder and raised the dynamic of the band to a \"harder, more clamorous brass sound.\" The ban on instrumental recordings of 1942–1944 adversely affected the finances of the Count Basie Orchestra, as it did for all big bands in the United States. Despite taking on soloists from the next generation such as Wardell Gray, Basie was forced to temporarily disband the group for a short period in 1948, before dispersing again for two years in 1950. For these two years, Basie led a reduced band of between six and nine people, featuring performers such as Buddy Rich, Serge Chaloff and Buddy DeFranco.\n\n\n=== The \"Second Testament\" ===\nBasie reformed the jazz orchestra in 1952 for a series of tours, not only in the United States, but also in Europe in 1954 and Japan in 1963. The band released new recordings, some featuring guest singers such as Joe Williams, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Billy Eckstine. All relied on contributions from arrangers, some of whom are now synonymous with the Basie band: Neal Hefti, Quincy Jones and Sammy Nestico. Michael G. Nastos wrote of the recording with Eckstine: \n\n\"When the Count Basie Orchestra consented to team up with vocalist Billy Eckstine, choruses of angels must have shouted hallelujah. The combination of Basie's sweet jazz and Eckstine's low-down blues sensibilities meshed well on this one-shot deal, a program mostly of downtrodden songs perfectly suited for the band and the man.\"\nThis new band became known as \"The New Testament\" or \"The Second Testament\". With albums such as  The Atomic Mr. Basie (1958), April in Paris (1957) and Basie Plays Hefti (1958), the new Count Basie Orchestra sound became identifiable. The sound of the band was now that of a tight ensemble: heavier and more full bodied, contrasting with the riff-based band of the late 1930s and early 1940s. Whereas previously the emphasis had been on providing space for exemplary soloists such as Lester Young and Buck Clayton, now the focus had shifted to the arrangements, despite the presence of soloists such as trumpeter Thad Jones and saxophonist Frank Foster. This orchestral style continues as the typical sound of the band up to the present day, which has been criticized by some musicologists. In his book The Swing Era, Gunther Schuller described the group as \"perfected neo-classicism...a most glorious dead end.\" However, jazz critic Martin Williams offers a differing view. In his book Jazz Heritage, Williams wrote the following about a 1959 recording: \" . . . obviously this Basie orchestra is an ensemble whose virtues center on discipline, precision, and collective power.\" In his book The Jazz Tradition, Williams wrote:\n\n \"Since the mid-'fifties, the Count Basie Orchestra has been a superb precision ensemble, and perhaps the greatest brass ensemble of the century. And that fact adds an irony to a distinguished career, for it was not always such.\"\n\n\n=== Continuing band ===\nThe Count Basie Orchestra continued releasing recordings and albums after Basie's death in 1984. For example, Basie is Back (2006) features new recordings of classic tunes from the Basie Orchestra's catalog, including \"April in Paris\" and the band's early hit \"One O'Clock Jump\". The Basie band still collaborated with high-profile singers such as Ray Charles in Ray Sings, Basie Swings (2006), and with Allyn Ferguson on the album Swing Shift (1999). After Basie's death the band played under the direction of some of the players he had hired, including Thad Jones, Frank Foster, Grover Mitchell, Bill Hughes, and Dennis Mackrel. The band is currently under the direction of trumpeter Scotty Barnhart.\n\n\n== Leaders of the Count Basie Orchestra ==\nCount Basie 1935–1984\nThad Jones 1985–1986\nFrank Foster 1986–1995\nGrover Mitchell 1995–2003\nBill Hughes 2003–Sept. 2010\nDennis Mackrel 2010–2013\nScotty Barnhart 2013–present\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2024 - Grammy Award for Best Large Ensemble Jazz Album, Basie Swings the Blues\n2007- Long Island Music Hall of Fame\n2005- Inducted, Nesuhi Ertegun Jazz Hall of Fame\n2002 Lifetime Achievement Award\n1984- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance Big Band 88 Basie Street\n1983- Winner NEA Jazz Masters\n1982- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Big Band Warm Breeze\n1981- National Trustees Award\n1981- Honoree, Kennedy Center Awards\n1981- Honoree, Hollywood Walk of Fame\n1980- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Big Band On The Road\n1977- Best Jazz Performance By a Big Band Prime Time\n1976- Best Jazz Performance by a Soloist (Instrumental) Basie and Zoot\n1970- Initiated in Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia\n1963- Best Performance by an Orchestra- For Dancing This Time By Basie!

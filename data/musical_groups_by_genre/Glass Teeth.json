While going to film school in New York City in late 2009 and early 2010, he began making music to accompany his video projects, which he uploaded to MySpace under the name Glass Teeth. He also DJed under this name. Reutt (who was also going to college around this time and DJing on the side as Grim Trigger) connected with Thomas after a friend informed him that Thomas had played his songs. He dropped his own project to join Glass Teeth around 2013.\nThomas released a self-titled debut EP as Glass Teeth on Black Bus Records in 2011.

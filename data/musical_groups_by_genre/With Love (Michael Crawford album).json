    "text": "With Love (titled The Phantom Unmasked in North America and Australasia) is the second studio album by English actor and singer Michael Crawford, together with the London Symphony Orchestra. It was originally released in 1989 on Telstar Records.\nContinuing on a similar theme to his previous album Songs from the Stage and Screen (1987), With Love features Crawford singing show tunes from various musical theatre and films, but also includes two covers of pop songs.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nIn a review for AllMusic, Steven McDonald gave With Love four stars out of five, commenting that it was \"a better showing\" for Crawford than his previous album Songs from the Stage and Screen. He went on to say that a \"big surprise\" was Art of Noise keyboardist Anne Dudley's arranging and conducting on \"When I Fall in Love\", \"that would make [arranger and orchestrator] Nelson Riddle nod appreciatively.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAdapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nMichael Crawford – vocals (all tracks)\nBarbara Dickson – vocals (track 3)\nProduction\n\nAnne Dudley – arranger (track 8), conductor (track 8)\nSteve Gray – arranger (tracks 4, 9, 11)\nNick Ingman – arranger (tracks 6, 10, 12), conductor (tracks 1, 6, 10)\nAndrew Powell – arranger (track 3), conductor (track 3)\nAndrew Pryce Jackman – arranger (tracks 1, 2, 5), conductor (tracks 2, 5, 7)\nHarry Rabinowitz – conductor (tracks 4, 9, 11, 12)\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWith Love at Discogs\nThe Phantom Unmasked at Discogs"

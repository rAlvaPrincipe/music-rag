    "text": "Different Touch is a Bangladeshi band in the early 1990s, originating from Khulna, by Balaam.  \nDifferent Touch performed soft rock and blues and were known for songs such as Drishti Prodip, Sraboner Megh, Bhalobashar Tanpura. The band, however, became inactive in the late 1990s when three members of the band went abroad permanently and vocalist Misbah took over his family business in Khulna following his father's death.\nDifferent Touch made a comeback in 2013, 16 years after the release of its fourth album titled Proshno in 1997. The title of the upcoming fifth album has not yet been finalised, but recording of most of the 10 songs have been completed, said the vocalist and band leader Misbah Rahman, widely known simply as Misbah.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nMisbah Rahman (vocals, lyrics, tune, Former Vocal of Warfaze)\nPial (bass guitar, lyrics, tune)\nPolash (guitar)\nNayan (keyboard)\nTanvir (drums)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nPanna (lead guitar)\nMilon (drums)\nTasmin (lead guitar)\nMilan (bass guitar)\nNaim (keyboard)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDifferent Touch : Volume One (ডিফারেন্ট টাচ ১ম খন্ড) (1990)\nSraboner Megh (Monsoon Cloud) (1991)\nShajano Prithibi (Gifted Earth) (1993)\nProshno (Question) (1997)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nAbeg (আবেগ) (1993)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDifferent Touch on Facebook"

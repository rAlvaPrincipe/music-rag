    "text": "Kaleida are an English-German duo formed in 2013. The band consists of vocalist Christina Wood and keyboardist Cicely Goulder. Kaleida released their debut EP, Think, in 2015, followed by Detune in 2016. This was followed by their first album, Tear the Roots, in 2017 and Odyssey in 2020. Their third album, In Arms, came out in 2024.\nIn 2014, the band's title track from their debut EP appeared on the soundtrack of the action film John Wick. They have been featured on numerous other TV shows, Netflix series, and the movie Atomic Blonde.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2013–2015: Formation and Think ===\nKaleida formed in 2013, when Wood and Goulder were introduced by a mutual friend through email. At the time, Wood had been at work in the forests of Borneo, while Goulder had been in the film industry. From 2013 to late 2014, the duo released demos of songs \"Think\" and \"Tropea\", releasing a video for the latter in 2013. On 19 December 2014 Lex Records announced they had signed Kaleida and would be releasing their debut extended play, Think, on 6 April 2015. In 2014, Kaleida garnered worldwide attention when their song, \"Think\", was featured in the 2014 action film John Wick and its soundtrack. The song's minimalist structure specifically contrasted the violent scenes in which it was used.\n\n\n=== 2015: Touring and Detune ===\nIn a 2015 interview with Ground Sounds, Kaleida stated that following their European tour with Róisín Murphy, the band would begin work on their debut album. On 3 November 2015 Kaleida released a new single, \"Detune\". On 24 February 2016 the band released a new single, \"It's Not Right\", and a second EP, Detune, was released on 26 February. Their debut album, Tear the Roots, was set for a September 2017 release.\n\n\n=== 2017: Tear The Roots ===\nKaleida released their debut album, Tear The Roots, on 15 September 2017.\n\n\n=== 2020: Odyssey ===\nKaleida released their second album, Odyssey, on 28 August 2020.\n\n\n== Members ==\nChristina Wood - vocals (2013–present)\nCicely Goulder - keyboards, production (2013–present)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nThink (Lex Records, 2015)\nDetune (Lex Records, 2016)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nTear the Roots (Lex Records, 2017)\nOdyssey (Lex Records, 2020)\nIn Arms (2024)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Think\" (2013)\n\"Tropea\" (2013)\n\"Picture You\" (2014)\n\"Aliaa\" (2015)\n\"Detune\" (2015)\n\"It's Not Right\" (2016)\n\"99 Luftballons\" (2017)\n\"Other Side\" (2020)\n\"Long Noon\" (2020)\n\"Odyssey\" (2020)\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" (2020)\n\n\n=== Appearances on soundtracks ===\nJohn Wick: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - \"Think\" (2014)\nCSI – \"Aliaa\" (2014)\nSearch Party - \"The Call\" (2016)\nAtomic Blonde: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - \"99 Luftballons\" (2017)\nWu Assassins (Netflix Original Series S1:E1) - \"Aliaa\" (2019)\nMonarca (Netflix Original Series) - \"The Call\" and \"Aliaa\" (2019)\nCharmed (Netflix Original Series) - \"Detune\" (2019)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

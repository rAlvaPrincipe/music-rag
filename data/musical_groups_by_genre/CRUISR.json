The line-up consists of Andy States (Vocals, Guitar), Jon Van Dine (Drums), and Bruno Catrambone (Guitar).\n\n\n== Background ==\nCRUISR's beginnings date back to 2012 as a solo project of lead singer, Andy States. States wrote and recorded the band's first EP in his Philadelphia bedroom, fixated on the idea of what it means to craft a pop song.\n\"I have an obsession with writing pop music and the idea that songs can transcend people,\" States says. \"I saw that producer Jeremy Park started writing blog articles about how he recorded Youth Lagoon, so I wrote to him and sent him my songs asking for advice and knowledge. He wrote back and loved my stuff and helped me produce the first EP.\"\nThe \"Cruiser EP\" garnered attention on various blogs and led to the expansion of the band.\n\n\n== 2014 ==\nIn 2014, the band released their debut single, \"All Over\", working with producer Andrew Maury (RAC, Panama Wedding, Ra Ra Riot).

They toured in July and August with Young Rising Sons and Hunter Hunted beginning on July 25 in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n\n== 2016 ==\nOn May 4, bassist Kyle Cook departed from the band to focus on his graphic design career. They announced this via the band's Facebook account.\nOn July 17, they released a brand new 2-track single titled \"Throw Shade\", which also includes a b-side, \"Moving to Neptune\".\nStarting May 11, CRUISR supported PVRIS on a full U.S. tour along with Lydia.\nOn Nov 19, CRUISR supported AGAINST THE CURRENT on their \"In Our Bones\" North America tour.\n\n\n== 2018 ==\nIn March and April, CRUISR supported Matt & Kim on the first leg of their North American tour.\nOn April 19, CRUISR released their first single since 2016 titled 'Mind Eraser', which was featured on Spotify's New Music Friday playlist.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nAndy States — lead vocals, rhythm guitar (2012–present)\nJon Van Dine — drums (2012–present)\nBruno Catrambone — lead guitar, keyboards (2014–present)\n\n\n=== Touring members ===\nWesley Bunch — bass guitar (2016)\nPaul Impellizeri — bass guitar (2016–2017)\nPeter Pantina — bass guitar\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nKyle Cook — bass guitar (2012–16)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nCRUISR (2015)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nCruiser (2012)\n\"All Over\" (2014)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Go For It\" (2015)\n\"Throw Shade\" (2015)\n\"Take That\" (2016)\n\"Mind Eraser\" (2018)\n\"Opening Up\" (2019)\n\"Get Out\" (2019)\n\"Thick and Thin\" (2022)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nVagrant Profile Archived 2015-07-09 at the Wayback Machine"

    "text": "The Blasting Company, formerly known as the Petrojvic Blasting Company, is an American nouveau-folk band based in Los Angeles, California. The band was founded in 2008 by half-brothers Justin Rubenstein and J.R. Kaufman and the group has since expanded to include five members.\nThe band composed the soundtrack for the Cartoon Network mini-series Over the Garden Wall.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Blasting Company originally started as a street band called Albania Mania.  They traveled around America living on a school bus and busking with a frequent rotation of members. When their bus exploded in Savannah, GA, they decided to live there.  While there they met a kind old man approached who inspired them to learn Yugoslavian music so that they could perform at his upcoming party. The man's surname was Petrojvic (or that's how they thought it was spelled) so after learning all the music on his list, they redubbed themselves the Petrojvic Blasting Company. \nIn 2007, while busking in Nashville, Tennessee, they met their future bandmate, Brandon Armstrong. It is reported by them that he was the unsung hero of the band during their work on \"Over the Garden Wall\".\nIn 2014, when releasing their soundtrack to \"Over the Garden Wall\", the band shortened their name to \"The Blasting Company\" with the reasoning that they were no longer performing the songs on the man's list.\n\n\n== Style ==\nThe band's music is inspired by the music of Eastern Europe, particularly the music of the Balkans, and New Orleans dixie. The band has also been noted for its folk influences and Bohemian style.\nThe band uses a variety of more orthodox instruments including an accordion, as well as a Bulgarian tapan.\n\n\n== Performances and projects ==\nThe band regularly performs in Los Angeles, and plays every Sunday at the Hollywood Farmers' Market.\nThe band wrote the soundtrack for the television miniseries Over the Garden Wall, for which it was critically acclaimed. The extended version of the soundtrack was debuted at San Diego Comic-Con in 2016.\nThe band provided a theme for a fan made Dungeons and Dragons project titled The Crooked Moon. They have also been offered opportunities to provide further music including themes and ambience tracks for the individual campaigns within the expansion.\nThe band has contributed music for an upcoming indie game currently in Kickstarter called Layers Deep.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nA Gift To Remember (2008)\nA History of Public Relations Dilemmae (2010)\nOver the Garden Wall (2016) (Also includes Elijah Wood, Collin Dean, Jack Jones and others)\nKids of Rutherford County (2024)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nSketches of the Unknown (2020)\nTiny Star (2020)\nFor Hire (2022) (Includes Ashley Nguyen DeWitt)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nCandy (2020)\nOld Summer Reckoning (2021) (Co-written by Van Dyke Parks)\nCrooked Moon (2023)\nCoal Eyed Birds (2024) (Includes Frank Fairfield)\n\n\n== References =="

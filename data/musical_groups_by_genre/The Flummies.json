    "text": "The Flummies are a Canadian Aboriginal music group from Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador.  Their name comes from a traditional Labrador trappers’ bread (Flummies (flum`-meez`) n. - traditional Labrador trappers’ bread using a mixture of flour, salt and baking powder.) The group was founded in 1978 from members of the Best White Band.  They have released several albums of traditional music.\nThe Flummies are a five piece aboriginal music group known for recording and preserving the historical, cultural and traditional songs of Labrador. The indigenous influences of the Innu, Inuit and Métis have been intertwined over the last 250 years, to produce songs which tell stories of the people who have survived hard times and have seen all the beauty the Labrador landscape has to offer.\nSince the 1989 release of their second album, Songs of Labrador, The Flummies have sold thousands of albums and have performed around the province of Newfoundland and Labrador at many festivals and conferences. Included in their touring was a five show performance in Germany in 1989 and twenty-eight shows at the base of the CN Tower in June 1999.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAlton Best on vocals, acoustic guitar and harmonica *deceased, May 11, 2011\nRichard Dyson on accordion and percussion\nTunker Campbell on acoustic and electric lead guitars and vocals\nLeander Baikie on acoustic guitar and vocals\nSimeon Asivak on bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\nFour Songs from Labrador (1986)\nSongs of Labrador (1989)\nLabradorimiut (2000)\nWay Back Then (2001)\n25th Anniversary Album (2003)\nSongs for Christmas (2003)\nThis is the Life For Me (2008)\nThe River (2010)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n2000 nomination: Aboriginal Artist/Group of the Year (Music Industry Association of Newfoundland and Labrador)\n2001 nomination: Aboriginal Artist/Group of the Year (East Coast Music Awards)\n2002 winner: Aboriginal Artist/Group of the Year (Music Industry Association of Newfoundland and Labrador)\n2003 nomination: Aboriginal Artist/Group of the Year (East Coast Music Awards)\n2009 winner:  Aboriginal Recording of the Year (East Coast Music Awards)\n2012 nomination: World Recording of the Year (East Coast Music Awards)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1] official website\nListing on Heritage of Newfoundland and Labrador website"

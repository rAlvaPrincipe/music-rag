    "text": "Morgarten is a band of folk – black metal founded in Neuchâtel, Switzerland in 2005. The band performed in many European countries alongside in particular Finntroll, Wind Rose and Slechtvalk.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe group's name comes from the legendary Battle of Morgarten, which took place on 15 November south of Zürich. There, a few Swiss Confederates pushed back the Duke Leopold I, Duke of Austria, Lord of Habsburg. The themes of their songs are mainly taken from Swiss history and heroic fantasy.\nThey released their first self-produced album, \"Risen to Fight\", in 2015. Their second album, \"Cry of the Lost\", released in 2021, is distributed by \"Inner Wound Recordings\". It is freely inspired by the story of Arnold von Winkelried. The group's keyboardist, Maël Porret, is also Swiss champion of acrobatic paragliding solo in 2020.\n\n\n== Members ==\nPierric Weber: Vocals and Guitar\nIlann Porret: Guitar and Vocals\nCédric Volet: Bass guitar and Backing vocals\nMaël Porret: Keyboard\nJoël Volet: Drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nRisen to Fight (2016)\nCry of the Lost (2021)\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n=== Clips ===\nWind from the Forest\nTo Victory\n\n\n=== Lyric videos ===\nTales of My Lands\nThe Last Breath\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.morgarten.net\nMorgarten discography at Discogs"

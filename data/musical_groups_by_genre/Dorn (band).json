    "text": "Dorn is a German black metal band.\nIt was founded as a solo project in 1998 by Roberto Liebig, the ex-keyboardist of pagan metal band Riger.  Dorn's 2000 debut album Falschheit was recorded in the studios of CCP Records in Linz, with Liebig playing all of the instruments himself.\nThe album received good reviews, so Liebig was signed by CCP Records and left his role in Riger. Falschheit was followed by Brennende Kälte in 2001 and Schatten der Vergangenheit in 2002.  For the 2004 album Suriel, Liebig was joined by Michael Werber, Sebastian Ziem, Lars, and Ira. With this lineup, Dorn toured in Germany, but in 2005 Lars and Ira left the band. In October 2006, Liebig and the other two remaining band members recorded the album Spiegel der Unendlichkeit, which was released on February 23, 2007.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2000: Falschheit\n2001: Brennende Kälte\n2002: Schatten der Vergangenheit\n2004: Suriel\n2007: Spiegel der Unendlichkeit\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website—in German, with album samples and more information on the band.\nDorn discography at Discogs \nBand MySpace Page—contains an extended biography in both English and German.\nDorn at Encyclopaedia Metallum"

The song, composed by Maurice Steenbergen and Danny Scholte, took a minimalist approach: during the whole length of the track, a distinctive pounding beat with a \"poing\" sound can be heard. The track topped the charts in the Netherlands and Denmark. It reached number 27 in the UK chart in November 1992.\nThe English football team West Bromwich Albion F.C.'s \"Boing Boing\" crowd chant is reportedly based on this track.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe band's official homepage"

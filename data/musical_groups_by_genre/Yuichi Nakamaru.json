He is the oldest child in a family of five composed of his parents and two younger sisters with 6 and 4 years age difference respectively.

Sasazaki eliminated all posts from her SNS on the 16.\nOn August 7, 2024, Shūkan Bunshun reported that Nakamaru had secretly met with a 20-year-old college student at a hotel. Nakamaru responded with an apology \"to all concerned\", through his agency, which also posted a comment regarding his \"lack of awareness and responsibility\".

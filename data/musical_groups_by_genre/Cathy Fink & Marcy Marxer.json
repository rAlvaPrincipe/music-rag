A singer, guitarist, banjo player and yodeler, she made her recording debut in 1975 with Duck Donald, with whom she toured for five years and recorded three albums.\nMarcy Marxer grew up in Swartz Creek, Michigan and learned to play guitar, mandolin, hammered dulcimer and button accordion while still in high school. She went to work for General Motors but continued to play at every opportunity. In 1978, after receiving theater training at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Ringling Brothers Clown College, she devoted herself to music full-time.\nThe two met in 1980, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, at the Mariposa Folk Festival. By 1983 they had begun writing songs together and appearing on each other's albums. Soon after, they began performing together, often in children's concerts. In 1989, they released a self-titled album, and a permanent partnership was formed.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n14 Grammy Nominations\nGrammy 2003 Best Musical Album for Children- cELLAbration: a Tribute to Ella Jenkins \nGrammy 2004 Best Musical Album for Children - Bon Appétit!\nFinalist John Lennon Songwriting Contest Award - 2008 - JUBILATION\nJohn Lennon Songwriting Contest Grand Prize Winner, ISC Grand Prize Winner - 2005 SCAT LIKE THAT\nDagnabbit– John Lennon Songwriting Contest Award\nNames - Mid Atlantic Songwriting Contest, Best Folk Song\n\n\n== Discography ==\nWAHOO!

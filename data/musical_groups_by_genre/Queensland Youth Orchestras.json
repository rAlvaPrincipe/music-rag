    "text": "Queensland Youth Orchestras (QYO) is one of the state's organisations for orchestral training and performance and is based at the Old Museum building in Gregory Terrace, Bowen Hills, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nUnder the artistic leadership of Maestro Simon Hewett since 2020, QYO has 470 members aged from 9 to 24 in three symphony orchestras, two concert bands, two junior string ensembles (as of 2023), a chamber orchestra and a big band. Each group has its own annual program of rehearsals, tutorials, concerts and, in some cases, music camps and tours.\nThe leading orchestra, the Queensland Youth Symphony conducted by Simon Hewett, tours internationally every four years and performs an annual concert series at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre and The Old Museum.\nEach October, around 640 musicians audition for QYO before a panel of professional musicians and over 500 musicians are offered positions in orchestras. Performing members of QYO must re-audition for a place each year alongside new applicants.\n\n\n== Conductors ==\nSimon Hewett: Conductor of QYS (Queensland Youth Symphony (previously known as QYO1)) since 2020\nPaul Dean: Conductor of QYO2 (Second Queensland Youth Orchestra) since 2021.\nDavid Deacon: Conductor of QYO3 (Third Queensland Youth Orchestra) since 2021.\nRob McWilliams: Conductor of the Wind Symphony since 2020.\nDavid Law: Conductor of the Wind Ensemble since 2009.\nChen Yang: Conductor of the Junior String Ensemble since 1991.\nBohdan Davison: Conductor of the Big Band since 2018.\n\n\n== National Youth Concerto Competition ==\nThe John Curro National Youth Concerto Competition (NYCC) was established in 1976 by QYO founder John Curro (1932-2019). Open to string players (violin, viola, cello, and double bass) in Australia under the age of 18, the NYCC is the most prestigious competition of its kind in Australia. Up to four Recitalists are selected to perform recitals, and rehearse and perform as members of the Queensland Youth Symphony during Finals Week.

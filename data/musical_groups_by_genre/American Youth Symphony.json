    "text": "The American Youth Symphony (AYS) was an orchestra based in Los Angeles, California, United States, It was founded in 1964.\n\n\n== History ==\nAYS was founded in 1964 by conductor Mehli Mehta (father of Zubin Mehta and Zarin Mehta), then Director of the Orchestra Department at UCLA. Mehta led AYS for 33 seasons, retiring at age 90. In 2016, Carlos Izcaray was announced as the third and last music director in the orchestra's history until the orchestra's disbandment. In March 2024, AYS announced it had played its final performance on February 25 and would cease operations on March 15. This was due to financial concerns and the lingering effects of the COVID pandemic.\n\n\n== Training ==\nDuring the 2013/14 season, AYS was composed of 108 musicians from 26 schools. Training with AYS is tuition-free, and acceptance is competitive. Each season, 250-300 applicants audition to fill an average of 30 open positions.\n\n\n== Programs ==\nAYS performs five to seven concerts each season, and the majority of concerts are presented free to the public at UCLA's Royce Hall. Performances have been described by the Los Angeles Times as possessing \"polish and depth\". The repertoire includes classical masterworks, along with contemporary compositions and film music.\nPast guest artists have included Sarah Chang, Daníel Bjarnason, Anna Clyne, Johannes Moser, Lera Auerbach, Valentina Lisitsa, David Newman, Alan Silvestri, Charles Fox, Danny Elfman and John Williams.\n\n\n=== The Hollywood Projects ===\nIn May 2012, AYS launched the multi-year \"Elfman Project\" featuring the scores of composer Danny Elfman, and conducted by Oscar-nominated film composer David Newman.\nThis project follows a similar three-year exploration of the work of film composer Jerry Goldsmith, and serves the dual purpose of training young musicians in the art of playing for film, and restoring and preserving film scores.\nThe Elfman Project has received attention and praise from the film music community, with Justin Craig of Film Score Monthly writing:\n\"The American Youth Symphony stands high, mastering the challenge of performing film music with all its unconventional meters and rhythms. Don’t be deceived by the label of “youth” orchestra; the AYS is the real deal.\"\nThis project has been supported by the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, the James Irvine Foundation, and BMI.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nAYS alumni \"populate major American orchestras of all stripes and make up significant percentages of most of the major performing ensemble here in Los Angeles.\" As of 2014, thirteen AYS alumni perform with the LA Opera, seven with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, and fourteen with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmerican Youth Symphony official website"

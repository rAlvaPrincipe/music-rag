    "text": "3 The Hard Way are a New Zealand hip hop group formed in 1994. They are best known for their two New Zealand number one singles, \"Hip Hop Holiday\" from 1994, and \"It's On (Move to This)\" from 2003.\n\n\n== History ==\n3 The Hard Way's first release was \"Hip Hop Holiday\", released on Deepgrooves Entertainment in 1994. The song spent three weeks at the top of the New Zealand singles chart, selling in excess of 7,500 copies. Following the success of the record and the top-ten status of its follow-up, \"Many Rivers\", the group released their debut album later that year, Old School Prankstas.\n\"Hip Hop Holiday\" also charted in Australia, peaking at No. 17 on the ARIA singles chart, and becoming the 93rd highest-selling single of 1994 in Australia. The song featured an element of \"Dreadlock Holiday\" by 10cc. Due to a mix up with the clearance rights, all of this song's royalties now go to 10cc members Graham Gouldman and Eric Stewart.\nAt the end of 1995, after a dispute with Deepgrooves, the group decided to take a break. That break became a lengthy hiatus, and, despite recording a number of demos, it was not until a chance meeting with producer Alan Jansson in 2001 that the group signed a deal with Jansson and Simon Grigg's Joy label through Sony Music.\n3 The Hard Way released their second album Eyes on the Prize in November 2003. It peaked at number 14 in New Zealand. The first single released from this album, \"It's On (Move to This)\", which featured R&B singer Clement Karauti, went to No. 1 after 4 weeks on the New Zealand charts, and made further New Zealand music history when 3 The Hard Way became the only NZ artist/s to take the No. 1 spot from another NZ artist twice. This time, their single replaced Scribe's \"Stand Up\", which went on to spend a total of 12 weeks at the top of the NZ charts.\nFormer member Lance 'DJ Damage' Manuel did not rejoin the band when they reformed.  The band have been quiet since.\nOld School Prankstas was reissued by Joy Records in 2012.\n\n\n== Original Band members ==\nChris 'Mighty Boy C' Maiai\nMike 'DJ Mike Mixx' Paton\nLance 'DJ Damage' Manuel\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

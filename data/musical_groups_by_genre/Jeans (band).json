    "text": "JNS (previously known as the Jeans) is a Mexican girl group that rose to fame in late 1996 and 1997 and continued until 2008. In 2015, the band reunited and got back together and went on tour. In 2017, they released their seventh studio album, titled Metamorfosis.\nInitially created in 1994 by band member Patricia Sirvent with five members, after one of them dropped out of the project before the first album was recorded in 1996, the group remained as a four-piece until 2007 when it changed into a three-piece after changes in each of their albums, one of these included Dulce María (from 2000-2002), who would later become part of the successful Mexican pop group RBD.\nThe group released six studio albums (plus a full re-working of one of their albums) in the course of 12 years.\n\n\n== Discography & singles ==\nAll of the songs that the group recorded were sung in Spanish. Almost immediately upon stepping into the Mexican scene they saw success with the release of their first two singles \"Pepe\" and \"Me Pongo Mis Jeans\" (1996), both, taken from their self-titled album Jeans; soon after, Litzy left the band. It was not until the release of their second album in 1998, ¿Por Qué Disimular?, that they achieved their biggest success with the leading single, \"Enferma De Amor\" (1998), which later became their signature song and their best-known single, with Karla Díaz and Melissa Lopez as the new members. However, from their third album on, while remaining a fixture in the music scene and still relevant, they never achieved the same degree of success.\nIn 2003, the band re-released their fourth album, Cuatro para las Cuatro, with re-worked versions of the songs included in it, changing them from pop to grupera. In 2007, a compilation album (with an accompanying DVD) was released that included new versions of their best-known songs.\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n1996: Jeans (EMI)\n1998: ¿Por qué disimular?

Most of the members in the group would depart due to disagreements with manager Alejandro Sirvent (father of group member founder Patricia Sirvent) which would become source of controversy for the group and the way it was managed, with the exception of Dulce María as not only she was close with the band but the reason for her departure from the group was mostly due to landing the main role of Marcela Majía in the 2002 telenovela, Clase 406. In each of the albums the group saw a change in their line-up. During the first 12 years of the group before they reunited in 2015, a total of 13 girls became (in a more or less relevant way) part of the group.\nMembers\n\nMelissa López Zendejas (1997–1999) (2015–Present).

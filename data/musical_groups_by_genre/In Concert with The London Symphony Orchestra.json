    "text": "In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra (also cited as In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra Conducted by Paul Mann) is a live album and DVD by the English hard rock band Deep Purple, recorded on 25–26 September 1999 at the Royal Albert Hall in London with the London Symphony Orchestra, and released on 8 February 2000 on Eagle Records.\nThe album was a project started in 1999 by keyboardist Jon Lord, who sought to recreate the band's innovative 1969 album, Concerto for Group and Orchestra, of which the original score was lost. With the help of Marco de Goeij, a fan who was also a musicologist and composer, the two painstakingly recreated the lost score, and Lord elected to have the band perform it once more at the Royal Albert Hall, but this time with the London Symphony Orchestra rather than the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and with Paul Mann as conductor rather than Malcolm Arnold. The concert also featured songs from each member's solo careers, as well as a short Deep Purple set, and guest musicians such as Ronnie James Dio, the Steve Morse Band, and Sam Brown. In early 2001, two similar concerts were also performed in Tokyo, and were released as part of the Soundboard Series box set.\n\n\n== Track listings ==\n\n\n=== Single disc version ===\nReleased in 1999.\n\n\"Concerto for Group and Orchestra, Mov. 1\" – 17:03\n\"Concerto for Group and Orchestra, Mov. 2\" – 19:43\n\"Concerto for Group and Orchestra, Mov. 3\" – 13:28\n\"Wring That Neck\" – 4:38\n\"Pictures of Home\" – 9:56\n\"Smoke on the Water\" – 6:43\n\n\n=== DVD ===\n\"Pictured Within\"\n\"Wait a While\"\n\"Sitting in a Dream\"\n\"Love Is All\"\n\"Wring That Neck\"\n\"Concerto for Group and Orchestra, Movement I\"\n\"Concerto for Group and Orchestra, Movement II\"\n\"Concerto for Group and Orchestra, Movement III\"\n\"Ted the Mechanic\"\n\"Watching the Sky\"\n\"Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming\"\n\"Pictures of Home\"\n\"Smoke on the Water\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDeep Purple\nIan Gillan – vocals\nSteve Morse – guitar\nJon Lord – keyboards\nRoger Glover – bass\nIan Paice – drums\nThe London Symphony Orchestra\nPaul Mann – conductor\nAdditional musicians\nRonnie James Dio – lead vocals on \"Sitting in a Dream\", \"Love Is All\"\nAitch McRobbie, Margo Buchanan, Pete Brown – backing vocals\nMario Argandoña – vocals, percussion\nSam Brown – backing vocals, lead vocals on \"Wait a While\"\nMiller Anderson – lead vocals on \"Pictured Within\"\nGraham Preskett – violin on \"Love Is All\"\nSteve Morris – guitar on \"That's Why God Is Singing the Blues\"\nEddie Hardin – piano on \"Love Is All\"\nAnnie Whitehead – trombone\nPaul Spong – trumpet, flugelhorn\nRoddy Lorimer – trumpet, flugelhorn\nSimon C.

    "text": "The Minnesota State University Marching Band (also known as The Maverick Machine) is the marching band of Minnesota State University, Mankato.  The band generates enthusiasm and excitement by promoting school spirit and morale. The group performs at home football, hockey, and basketball events. The Maverick Machine consists of five ensembles: the marching band, drumline, color guard, pep band, and the indoor winds, which is the first collegiate WGI winds group in Minnesota.\nThe group originally formed in 1929 as one of the first instrumental music offerings during the transition from the Mankato Normal School to the Mankato State Teachers College. The name 'Marching Machine' was added when Clayton Tiede took reins of the band in 1960. The band had a longstanding tradition of excellence crossing many decades until the 90s when budgets became tighter and transitioned to a pep band only. The current band reformed in 2013 as a result of the current director, Michael Thursby, leadership. \nOn average, the Maverick Machine plays at over 80 events per school year for approximately 170,000 people.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMinnesota State Marching Band on Facebook"

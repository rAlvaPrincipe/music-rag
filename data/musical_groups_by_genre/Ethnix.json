The band formed in 1989 as a collaboration between vocalist Ze'ev Nechama and keyboardist Tamir Kaliski, joined by drummer Gal Hadani and guitarist Gil Alon.\nNechama and Kaliski had originally formed a band called Moskva (Hebrew: מוסקבה, [moskˈva] - \"Moscow\"), making Ethnix the oldest continuously-operating band in Israel, together since 1985.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first album, Desert Bird, sold 40,000 copies. Their second album, Masala, sold over 60,000 copies in the first half-year of its release.\n\nIn 1996, guitarist/bassist Yoram Poizner joined. Albums include elements of rock, pop, dance, Mediterranean, and more. Ze'ev and Tamir, the main composers, created and produced for many more artists over the years, including Eyal Golan for whom they wrote three albums which helped propel him and the Mediterranean style to popularity. Other artists they have composed for include Sharon Haziz, Yehudah Keisar, Hagmalim, Izkis and Hayalei Hanekama.\nOn 2 July 2011, Ethnix had an open concert in Caesarea.

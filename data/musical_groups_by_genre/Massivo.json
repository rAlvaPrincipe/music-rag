The group performed the song on Top of the Pops the week before it peaked.  The song \"bubbled under\" in Australia, only reaching no. 151.\nMassivo released at least two other singles (\"Kingdom of Love\" with Jackie Rawe and \"Take My Hand\") but never made the charts again.\n\n\n== References =="

The album was produced by Joshua James (Joshua James, Isaac Russell), mixed by Todd Burke (Ben Harper, Jack Johnson) and mastered by Reuben Cohen (Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Bruno Mars).  The album also features Brandon Campbell (Neon Trees) and Stuart Maxfield (Fictionist).\nHoarse & Roaring was featured on the July 2010 iTunes Indie Spotlight Podcast.

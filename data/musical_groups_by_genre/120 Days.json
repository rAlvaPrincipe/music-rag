When they changed their name, they took the new name from the Marquis De Sade's 120 Days Of Sodom. Originally based in Kristiansund, they moved to Oslo in 2002. After two EPs on the Public Demand label, the group signed to the Norwegian independent label Smalltown Supersound. Their first album, 120 Days, was released on 10 October 2006, and had several positive reviews in North American publications. The group toured the United States shortly after the album's release. 120 started producing new material for a record after returning to Oslo in 2008, following major touring around the United States and Europe. On 7 June 2012, 120 Days announced that the band would end by September that year. The band had played together for almost 11 years before announcing the last concert in September 2012.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nÅdne Meisfjord - vocals and guitar\nKjetil Ovesen - keyboards\nJonas Hestvik Dahl - bass guitar\nArne Kvalvik - drums\n\n\n== Honors ==\n2006: Two times Spellemannprisen in the categories best Rock band and Newcomer, for the album 120 Days\n\n\n== Discography ==\nEPs\n\n2003: The Beautiful People (Perfect Pop Records)\n2004: Sedated Times (Perfect Pop Records)\nAlbums\n\n2006: 120 Days (Smalltown Supersound (Norway), Vice records (US) and Traffic (Japan))\n2011: 120 Days II (Voices Of Wonder, Splendour)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n120 Days on Facebook"

The meaning behind the newly formed group's name comes from the idea that the infinity shape of the pastry symbolizes happiness and enjoyment. \n\n\n== History ==\nPretzelle's first performance took place at Thailand's biggest idol group event \"Idol Expo #3\" which held on January 30, 2020. The group announced their official debut on May 28, 2020, with the mini-album Pretzelle Day and music video for the first single \"Never Give Up\" (ไหวมั้ย). The original lineup of Pretzelle included four members: Inc (Mathawee Ratanawijit), Ice (Irawadee Sajjaphanitchkul), Nana (Pattaravarin Su), and Bamee (Kantisha Wibulsamai). The mini-album Pretzelle Day features three tracks: \"Never Give Up\" (ไหวมั้ย), \"I'm Glad\" (เมื่อโลกนี้มีเธอ) — the OST for the drama \"Leh Game Rak\" (เล่ห์เกมรัก), and \"Ping Pong Pang Let's Go\" — the OST for the Korean KBS1's children show \"Teteru\".\nIn July 2020, Nana announced her decision to leave Pretzelle for personal reasons.\nPRETZELLE joined Workpoint TV's reality television competition 'Lodi X Next Idol' in November 2020.

According to the statement, due to conflicts between her personal matters and responsibility as a Pretzelle member, the group agreed to terminate Bamee's member status. In January 2021, Pretzelle introduced 2 new members: Aumaim (Aunyarin Chaianansopon) and Grace (Apisara Chompusri).\nDuring a live streaming session on February 23, 2021, Pretzelle revealed its official fanclub name \"Twist\", taken from the twisting of pretzel dough.\nOn March 1, 2021, Pretzelle appeared on Workpoint TV's music program \"T-POP STAGE\", performing their new single \"First Love\" (ต้องชอบแค่ไหน).

    "text": "The Orquestra Simfònica del Gran Teatre del Liceu (Symphony Orchestra of the Gran Teatre del Liceu) is the opera orchestra of the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, Spain.  Founded concurrently with the theatre in 1847 (actually, it continues the orchestra of the Liceu previous theatre, founded in 1837 and active since 1838), it is the oldest orchestra still working in Barcelona, and the oldest in Spain.  The orchestra also performs symphony concerts at such venues as the Palau de la Música Catalana and at L'Auditori.\nThe first conductor of the orchestra was Marià Obiols.  The orchestra subsequently worked with guest conductors, including the composers Manuel de Falla, Alexander Glazunov, Richard Strauss, Igor Stravinsky, Ottorino Respighi, and Pietro Mascagni, but with no principal conductor or music director.  The first music director was Ernest Xancó, who took up the post in 1959 and served in that capacity until 1961.  Subsequent music directors have included Uwe Mund (1987-1994), Bertrand de Billy (1999-2004), Sebastian Weigle (2004–2008), and Michael Boder (2008-2012).  In October 2010, the company announced the appointment of Josep Pons as its next music director, as of September 2012, for an initial contract of 6 years.\n\n\n== Premieres performed by the orchestra ==\nThe Liceu opera house has been the location for the world premieres of several works, and for the Spanish premieres of many musical works, such as the following:\n\n1847 (April 4) Marià Obiols' cantata Il regio imene, the first musical work performed by the orchestra in the inauguration day\n1853 (January 8)  Temistocle Solera's Spanish opera La hermana de Pelayo, first opera premiered by the orchestra\n1874 (April 14) Felipe Pedrell's opera L'ultimo Abenzerraggio\n1892 (May 14) Tomás Bretón's opera Garín\n1895 (May 8) Isaac Albéniz's opera Henry Clifford\n1896 (January 5) Isaac Albéniz's opera Pepita Jiménez\n1902 (January 4) Felipe Pedrell's grand opera Els Pirineus\n1903 (December 3) Joan Manén's opera Acté\n1906 (January 20) Enric Morera's opera Empòrium\n1913 (January 15) Jaume Pahissa's first opera Gal·la Placídia\n1923 (March 31) Jaume Pahissa's Marianela\n1929 Manuel Blancafort's symphonic poem Matí de festa a Puiggraciós\n1932 (March 3) Joan Manén's opera Neró i Acté\n1948 (January 10) Xavier Montsalvatge's children opera El gato con botas\n1948 (January 10) Carlos Surinach's El mozo que casó con mujer brava\n1950 (December 14) Conrado del Campo's Lola la Piconera\n1955 (December 19) Joaquín Rodrigo's ballet Pavana Real\n1956 (April 28) Frederic Mompou and Xavier Montsalvatge's ballet Perlimplinada\n1961 (November 24) Manuel de Falla and Ernesto Halffter's scenic cantata Atlàntida\n1962 (December 11)  Xavier Montsalvatge's Una voce in off\n1974 (January 19)  Matilde Salvador's Vinatea\n1986 (May 22) Josep Soler's Oedipus et Iocasta\n1988 (September 21)  Xavier Benguerel's scenic cantata Llibre vermell\n1989 (September 24)  Leonardo Balada's opera Cristóbal Colón\n1990 (October 5) Xavier Benguerel's oratory Requiem for Salvador Espriu, at the Torroella de Montgrí International Festival of Music\n2000 (October 2) José Luis Turina's opera D.Q., Don Quijote en Barcelona, with settings by La Fura dels Baus\n2004 (November 3)  Joan Guinjoan's opera Gaudí\n\n\n== Music Directors ==\n1959-1961 Ernest Xancó\n1981-1984 Eugenio Marco\n1987-1994 Uwe Mund\n1999-2004 Bertrand de Billy\n2004–2008 Sebastian Weigle\n2008-2012 Michael Boder\n2012–present Josep Pons\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial home page (in Catalan)\nLiceu official page on the appointment of Josep Pons as music director"

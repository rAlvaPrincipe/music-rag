    "text": "The University of Utah Marching Band (also known as The Pride of Utah Marching Band or simply The Pride of Utah) has been called the premier marching ensemble of the University of Utah. The band has also been described as a staple of Utah's marching music history since its earliest days. The band performs at all University of Utah home football games, as well as some away games and bowl games. Its current director is Brian Sproul.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe University of Utah Athletics Department has stated that the University of Utah's band was started in the 1940s as a military ensemble performing at various ceremonies and events around the university campus. Taking a cue from college bands in the Midwest, A. Ray Olpin, President of the university, recruited Ron Gregory from Ohio State University in 1948 to establish a similar marching band for Utah. Despite early success, support for the band gradually faded during the 1960s which culminated in the termination of funding for the band by the Associated Students for the University of Utah (ASUU) in 1969.  A 1976 fund-raising campaign led by Gregg I. Hanson successfully re-established the band.\n\nThe Pride of Utah has performed at the following notable events:\n\nThe 2003 Liberty Bowl\nThe 2005 BCS Tostitos Fiesta Bowl\nThe 2005 Emerald Bowl\nThe 2006 Armed Forces Bowl\nThe 2007 Poinsettia Bowl\nThe 2009 BCS Allstate Sugar Bowl\nThe 2009 Inaugural Parade of President Barack Obama\nThe 2009 Poinsettia Bowl\nThe 2010 Maaco Bowl Las Vegas\nThe 2011 Sun Bowl\nThe 2014 Las Vegas Bowl\nThe 2015 Las Vegas Bowl\nThe 2016 Foster Farms Bowl\nThe 2017 Heart of Dallas Bowl\nThe 2018 Holiday Bowl\nThe 2019 Alamo Bowl\nThe 2022 Rose Bowl\nThe 2023 Rose Bowl\nThe 2023 Las Vegas Bowl\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Pride of Utah at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website"

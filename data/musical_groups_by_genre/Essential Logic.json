    "text": "Essential Logic are an English post-punk band formed in 1978 by saxophonist Lora Logic after leaving X-Ray Spex. The band initially consisted of Lora on vocals, Phil Legg on guitar and vocals, William Bennett (later of Whitehouse) on guitar, Mark Turner on bass guitar, Rich Tea (Richard Thompson) on drums and Dave Wright on saxophone. Turner was later replaced by Sean Oliver (later of Rip, Rig & Panic) on bass. The band split in 1981 and reformed in 2001.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group formed in 1978 with Logic fresh out of art school. Their first 7\" was released on their own record label, Cells. They then released a self-titled EP on Virgin Records in 1979, before signing to Rough Trade. Their debut studio album, Beat Rhythm News, was released in 1979, followed by several 7\"s. Work began on a second album but the band split in 1980 and the album, Pedigree Charm, was released as a Lora Logic solo LP. \nBetween 1978 and 1981, Logic also performed as a member of Red Crayola, as well as playing on recordings by Kollaa Kestää, The Stranglers, The Raincoats and Swell Maps.\nSoon after Pedigree Charm was released in 1982 on the Rough Trade label, Logic gave up recording and performing: she had turned to the Hare Krishna religion. She did record and perform under the X-Ray Spex name again when they reformed in 1995.\nShe resumed Essential Logic in 2001 with a new line-up, and released a four-track EP of new material. This version of the group included ex-members of the ska group Bad Manners and guitarist Gary Valentine of Blondie. A year later, a further four tracks from a recording session in 1998 were made available from the website, Vitaminic. In 2003, an anthology of Essential Logic recordings was issued, entitled Fanfare in the Garden, on the Kill Rock Stars record label. \nIn 2022 a new studio album, Land of Kali was released under the Essential Logic name.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nSingles & EPs\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEssential Logic at AllMusic"

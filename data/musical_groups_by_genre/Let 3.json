    "text": "Let 3 (Croatian pronunciation: [lêːt trîː]; transl. 'Flight 3') is a Croatian rock band based in Rijeka, Croatia formed in 1987. The frontmen are Damir Martinović \"Mrle\" (born 15 July 1961) and Zoran Prodanović \"Prlja\" (born 18 December 1964). Particularly popular in the SFR Yugoslavia, the band is known for their original approach to rock music and their obscene live performances. Their songs often contain provocative and vulgar lyrics. They represented Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 with the song \"Mama ŠČ!\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLet 3 was formed in Rijeka in the late 1980s. The band soon gained a reputation for their unprecedented, controversial and sometimes obscene performances, exemplifying the eclectic nature of Rijeka's music scene. The band's members have voiced support for liberal causes, such as women's and LGBT rights, and have taken a vocal stance against conservative politics and the Catholic Church.\nIn 1997, the band released their fifth album, titled Nečuveno (translated as 'Outrageous' or 'Unheard-of'). It was distributed as a CD, but it had nothing recorded on it. Nonetheless, 350 copies of the album were sold. Just one copy of their follow-up, Jedina (transl. 'The only one'), was initially made; the band refused to sell or distribute it. The record company eventually released the album in slightly different versions. As a protest, the band staged a mock suicide by firing squad on Ban Jelačić Square in Zagreb.\nIn late 2000, the band unveiled a four-metre tall statue named Babin kurac (transl. 'Grandma's dick'), depicting a woman with a horseshoe moustache and a one-metre long phallus. It was exhibited in various cities throughout Croatia.\nIn 2005, Let 3 released the single \"Rado ide Srbin u vojnike (Pička)\" (transl. 'The Serb gladly enlists in the army (Pussy)'), a play on the Serbian patriotic song \"Rado ide Srbin u vojnike\". In the song's music video, extras dressed in Serbian and Albanian national costumes are seen masturbating. The single featured on the studio album Bombardiranje Srbije i Čačka, which parodies Balkan machismo and militarism. The band stated: \"We wanted to create an album of what people here fear the most; namely peasantry… and pornography\". \nIn December 2006, the band was sanctioned by police after performing naked at an open-air concert in Varaždin. The band's defence that they had not been naked because they had corks in their anuses did not convince the judge; the court found them guilty and fined each member kn 350 (€47.78). On 14 December 2008, the live afternoon talk show Nedjeljom u dva was cut short by the host after two of the band members simulated the ejection of a cork from their rectums.\nOn 9 December 2022, Let 3 was announced as one of eighteen participants in Dora 2023, the Croatian national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2023, with the song \"Mama ŠČ!\". For their performance, they were joined by artist Žanil Tataj Žak as the character \"Njinle\" (meaning 'Lenin' in Šatrovački). They went on to win the competition by a landslide with a total of 279 points, thus gaining the right to represent Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 in Liverpool, United Kingdom. They performed at the first semi-final on 9 May 2023, placing eighth and thus qualifying for the final, where they ultimately came 13th with a score of 123 points (7th in the televote).\nFor the \"Mama ŠČ\" video, visuals and staging, as well as numerous live shows and performances, Let 3 collaborated with the drag artist Jovanka Broz Titutka, famous in the Croatian queer scene. \nLet 3 was again among the twenty-four participants of Dora 2024 with the song \"Babaroga\"; they advanced from their semi-final on 22 February 2024. In addition, they performed an interval act of their Croatian Eurovision Mama ŠČ! entry during voting.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Members ===\nAs of 2024\n\nDamir Martinović (Mrle) – bass guitar, effects, vocals\nZoran Prodanović (Prlja) – vocals\nIvan Bojčić (Bin) – drums\nDražen Baljak (Baljak) – guitar, mandolin\nMatej Zec (Knki) – guitar, backing tracks\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nBranko Kovačić (Husta) – drums, percussion\nKornelije Đuras (Korni) – keyboards, samples\nIvan Šarar (Faf) – keyboards, programming, samples\nIvica Dražić (Miki) – guitar, vocals\nNenad Tubin – drums, vocals\nIgor Perović (Gigi) – guitar\nZoran Klasić (Klas) – guitar, vocals\nOrijen Modrušan – guitar\nAlen Tibljaš – drums\nMarko Bradaschia – drums\nDean Benzia – drums\nSiniša Banović – drums\nLjubomir Silić – bass guitar\nRaoul Varljen – keyboards\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n1989 – Two Dogs Fuckin'\n1991 – El Desperado\n1994 – Peace\n1996 – Živi kurac (transl. 'Live cock')\n1997 – Nečuveno (transl. 'Unheard-of')\n2000 – Jedina (transl. 'The only one')\n2005 – Bombardiranje Srbije i Čačka (transl. 'Bombardment of Serbia and Čačak')\n2008 – Živa pička (transl. 'Live cunt')\n2013 – Kurcem do vjere / Thank You, Lord (transl. 'By dick to faith')\n2016 – Angela Merkel sere (transl. 'Angela Merkel shits')\n\n\n=== Charted singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Let 3 at Wikimedia Commons"

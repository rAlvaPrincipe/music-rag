In 1934, Fox left Juilliard to play with the Minneapolis Symphony, and then at the age of 21, he moved to California to join the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Fox spent the rest of his career in Los Angeles, touring with Xavier Cugat (1954), Stan Kenton (1956), and the Roger Wagner Chorale (1965), and playing on the soundtracks of many motion picture films for both Paramount Pictures and RKO Pictures, including The Flight of the Phoenix and Patton.

    "text": "Living Legends is an American hip hop supergroup consisting of indie hip hop artists from California. Beginning in the mid 1990s, the crew garnered a following by recording, promoting and performing their music independently through Legendary Music.\nThe crew is considered by LA Weekly to be \"one of the biggest success stories of the indie-rap movement, having sold millions of units collectively â€” all by them-damn-selves.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nLiving Legends originally grew out of Mystik Journeymen, consisted of BFAP (now known as Sunspot Jonz) and PSC (now known as Luckyiam). Beginning in 1994, the Mystik Journeymen began cultivating a fan base by selling their own tapes on the streets and hosting \"Underground Survivors\" shows in East Oakland. In 1995, the duo met The Grouch. They soon embarked on the first of several of self-funded tours throughout Europe. In 1996, Mystik Journeymen and The Grouch joined with the trio known as 3 Melancholy Gypsys (Eligh, Scarub, and Murs) of Los Angeles. They formed Living Legends in late 1990s. The crew has since grown to include Bicasso, Aesop and Arata.\nThe group and its members have founded and operated several imprints, including Outhouse Records and Revenge Entertainment. In 1999, Living Legends moved their base of operations to Los Angeles.\nIn May 2012, Murs quit the group. In June that year, The Grouch announced hiatus from the group.\nIn 2016, the group (Aesop, Bicasso, Eligh, Luckyiam, Murs, Scarub, Sunspot Jonz, and The Grouch) officially reunited for a regional tour and hit the road as part of the 10th annual How The Grouch Stole Christmas Tour.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent\n\nAesop The Black Wolf - vocals\nBicasso - vocals, production\nEligh - vocals, production\nLuckyiam - vocals\nScarub - vocals, production\nSunspot Jonz - vocals, production\nThe Grouch - vocals, production\nFormer\n\nArata - vocals\nMurs - vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nThe Underworld (2000)\nAngelz Wit Dirty Faces (2000)\nAlmost Famous (2001)\nCreative Differences (2004)\nClassic (2005)\nThe Gathering (2008)\nThe Return (2023)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nUBH Vol. 2 (1996)\nUBH Vol. 3: Against All Odds (1997)\nUBH 4: Stop & Retaliate (1999)\nUBH V - Legacy 2099 (2002)\nCrappy Old Sh*t (2003)\nLegendary Music Volume 1 (2006)\nLegendary Music Volume 2 (2008)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nThe Gathering (2008)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Gotta Question for Ya / Night Prowler / Forces of Nature\" (2001)\n\"Awakening / Fill My Drink Up\" (2004)\n\"Damn It Feels Good / Whatizit?\" (2004)\n\"Blast Your Radio\" (2004)\n\"Down for Nothin' / Brand New\" (2005)\n\"Never Fallin' / Good Fun\" (2005)\n\"She Wants Me\" (2008)\n\"Trojan Horse\" (2012)\n\"Legendaries\" (2021)\n\"LLXL\" featuring Eli-Mac (2022)\n\"Everyday\" (2023)\n\"Lettermen\" from The Return (2023)\n\"The Return\" from The Return (2023)\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\nStreet Legendz (2004)\nBroke Ass Summer Jam (2007)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nArnold, Eric K.

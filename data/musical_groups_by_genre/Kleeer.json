    "text": "Kleeer was an American New York City–based funk, disco and post-disco band, which was formed in 1972 under the name The Jam Band, as a backup group to different disco bands and vocalists.\n\n\n== Members ==\nWoodrow \"Woody\" Cunningham (lead vocalist and drummer, died 2010)\nPaul Crutchfield (percussionist and keyboardist)\nRichard Lee (guitarist)\nNorman Durham (bassist, died 2011)\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter a switch to the name Pipeline in 1975, the group also decided to switch to making hard rock instead of disco. Record labels competed to sign them but, when they finally ended up at Columbia Records, their single \"Gypsie Rider\" did not fare well commercially.\nIn 1976, they got the opportunity to become The Universal Robot Band along with underground disco producers Patrick Adams and Greg Carmichael. This project was more successful than their former projects. They made the single \"Barely Breaking Even\" alongside singer Leroy Burgess, and they also recorded an album. The group toured as The Universal Robot Band until 1978. After 1978, the band decided to make all their music themselves under the new name of Kleeer.\nBetween 1979 and 1985 the group released seven albums and had several hits in the US Billboard Hot 100 and in R&B charts. The most mentionable are \"Keep Your Body Workin'\", \"Tonight's the Night\", \"Winners\", \"Intimate Connection\", and \"Get Tough\". The sound was now more focused on 1980s style funk, and electronic instruments, like vocoders and synthesizers.\nThe System lead singer Mic Murphy was a road manager for the band before the start of his record career.\nAfter the 1985's album Seeekret, the band disappeared for unknown reasons. Most of the musicians continued working with other projects. In the 1990s, however, the group re-formed as Kleeer at some occasions.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKleer biography and discography at Discogs.\nSix Million Steps – Woody Cunningham/Kleeer Special radio show from November 2010\nKleeer – Norman Durham on YouTube\nKleeer at AllMusic"

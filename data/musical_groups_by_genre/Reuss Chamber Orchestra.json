In 1987 it was awarded the title \"Philharmonic Orchestra\". In 2000 it was merged with the traditional Landeskapelle Altenburg. In 2011, the Reuss Chamber Orchestra celebrates its 50th anniversary.\n\nHonoring the merits of the House of Reuss, Gera, the orchestra was renamed to \"Reuss Chamber Orchestra\" in 1989.\n\n\n== Management ==\nCEO: Solo oboist Guenter Gaebler\nCFO: Violinists Egbert Funda\nArt Director: NN\n\n\n== Concerts ==\nConcert tours have taken the Reuss Chamber Orchestra to various German federal states and a variety of European countries. Highlights include concerts with the Thomanerchor Leipzig and the Dresdner Kreuzchor. The soloists Gerhard Bosse, Karl Suske, Ludwig Güttler, Burkhard Glaetzner, Michael Sanderling, Michael Schoenheit and Andreas Hartmann worked and played music with the Reuss Chamber Orchestra.\nA CD has been recorded with Georg Fritzsch as conductor and Felix Friedrich as a soloist. The record presents an unknown organ concert by Ottorino Respighi to the public. Other DVD productions are available.\nOutstanding in the history of the Reuss Chamber Orchestra is the musical accompaniment of the first two services of the consecration of the rebuilt Dresden Frauenkirche. Ever since, there has been intensive cooperation with the Frauenkirche cantor Matthias Gruenert, which has led to various joint concerts, going beyond the cities Gera, Altenburg and Dresden.\nIn 2008, 2010 and 2011 the Reuss Chamber Orchestra accompanied the New Year's church service in the Dresdner Frauenkirche broadcast by national TV station ZDF.

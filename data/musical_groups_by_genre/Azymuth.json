    "text": "Azymuth is a Brazilian jazz-funk group formed in 1973. The original lineup was a trio composed of José Roberto Bertrami (keyboards), Alex Malheiros (bass, guitars), and Ivan Conti (drums, percussion). Kiko Continentino joined the group in 2015 as the band's keyboardist after Bertrami's death. As of April 2023, Alex Malheiros is the only surviving original member of the group.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom 1979 to 1988, they released many albums for Milestone Records. They also had a major hit single with \"Jazz Carnival\", a product of their Light as a Feather album, in 1979.  It peaked at number 19 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1980.

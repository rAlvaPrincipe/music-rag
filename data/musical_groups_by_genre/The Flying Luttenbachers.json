    "text": "The Flying Luttenbachers are an American instrumental noise rock band led by multi-instrumentalist, composer, improviser and producer Weasel Walter. \nThe Flying Luttenbachers have created a body of work focused on musical extremity and dissonance. Their music ranges from intense all-acoustic free improvisation to complex and modernistic rock composition, and from electronic noise to punk-inspired jazz. Walter has been quoted as saying he has drawn musical inspiration from the fields of punk, death metal, free jazz, and no wave. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe Flying Luttenbachers formed in December 1991 in Chicago, Illinois, as a punk jazz trio, with Hal Russell (tenor and soprano saxes, trumpet, vibraphone, and drums; co founder), Chad Organ (tenor sax, moog synthesizer, and baritone sax) and Weasel Walter (drums, guitar, bass, keyboards, woodwinds, electronics, and main composer). The band derived their moniker from Russell's birth name, Harold Luttenbacher. Russell left the band in June 1992, and was soon replaced by Ken Vandermark for the recording of The Flying Luttenbachers' first 7″ record.\nSince its formation, the band's personnel have changed several times under Walter's leadership. The band has featured several free jazz and experimental rock musicians including Fred Lonberg-Holm, Kurt Johnson, Jeb Bishop, Alex Perkolup, Mick Barr, Ed Rodriguez, Mike Green, and Jonathan Hischke. The Flying Luttenbachers have toured Europe and the US extensively with bands including The Locust, Arab On Radar, Lightning Bolt, U.S. Maple, Erase Errata, Bobby Conn, and Wolf Eyes.\nWalter moved from Chicago to Oakland, California, in 2003, and then again to the San Francisco Bay Area. He refreshed The Flying Luttenbachers with the addition of bassist Mike Green, guitarist Ed Rodrigues and later Mick Barr. The band played their final concert in November 2006 before officially disbanding in November 2007 with the release of a studio album (recorded solo by Walter).\nIn 2017, after a 10-year hiatus, The Flying Luttenbachers reformed, accepting an invitation to play at the Sonic Protest festival. Walter (on drums) was joined by guitarist Chris Welcome and bassist Tim Dahl. The group opened three shows for Oh Sees in October 2018 before touring Europe in April 2019.\nIn 2019, a quartet version of the band released Shattered Dimension. Joining Walter (on drums) was saxophonist Matt Nelson, bassist Tim Dahl, and guitarist Brandon Seabrook. Over the next few years, the band's varying lineup included bassist Evan Lipson; guitarists Henry Kaiser, Wendy Eisenberg, Katie Battistoni, and Alex Ward; and drummer Sam Ospovat.\n\n\n== Conceptual continuity ==\nSince 1996’s Revenge album, the Flying Luttenbachers’ musical output has been underlined by a gradually unravelling storyline concerning the self-obliteration of the planet Earth and the resulting aftermath. The 2006 album Cataclysm concerns an interstellar battle between two monolithic entities: The Void (a dark, silent spectre detailed in 2004’s album of the same name) and The Iridescent Behemoth (a massive planetoid being whose tale was told in 2003’s complex Systems Emerge from Complete Disorder album). The music energetically utilizes deliberate harmonic dissonance and the material operates on a principle of intelligent transformation of concise amounts of interrelated themes.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent Members\n\nWeasel Walter - drums, guitar, bass, keyboards, woodwinds, electronics, main composer (1991-2007, 2017-present)\nLuke Polipnick - bass guitar (2023-present)\nJames Paul Nadien - drums (2024-present)\nFormer Members\n\nHal Russell - tenor and soprano saxes, trumpet, vibraphone, drums, co-founder (1991-1992)\nChad Organ - tenor sax, moog synthesizer, baritone sax (1992-1994)\nKen Vandermark - tenor sax, Bb and bass clarinets (1992-1994)\nJeb Bishop - bass, Casio keyboard, trombone (1993-1994, 2022)\nDylan Posa - guitar, Casio keyboard (1993-1994, 1998)\nChuck Falzone - guitar, bass (1995-1998)\nWilliam Pisarri - bass, Bb clarinet, vocals, etc. (1995-1998)\nAaron Dilloway - drums (1997)\nKurt Johnson - bass, contrabass (1998-2000)\nMichael Colligan - tenor sax, Bb and alto clarinets, etc. (1998-2000)\nJulie Pomerleau - violin (1998)\nFred Lonberg-Holm - cello (1998-2000)\nAlex Perkolup - bass (2001-2002, 2022)\nJonathan Hischke - bass (2001-2002)\nEd Rodriguez - guitar, bass (2003-2006)\nMike Green - bass (2003-2005, 2006)\nMick Barr - guitar, bass (2005)\nRob Pumpelly - guitar, bass (2006)\nTony Dryer - bass (2006)\nChris Welcome - guitar (2017)\nEvan Lipson - bass (2018)\nBrandon Seabrook - guitar (2018-2019)\nHenry Kaiser - guitar (2007, 2019)\nWendy Eisenburg - guitar (2019)\nTim Dahl - bass (2017-2021)\nMatt Nelson - tenor sax (2018-2021)\nAlex Ward - guitar (2019)\nKatie Battistoni - guitar (2019-2021)\nSam Ospovat - drums (2020-2021)\nCharlie Werber - drums (2022-2024)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"546 Seconds Of Noise\" (1992)\n\"1389 Seconds Of Noise\" (1993)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nDestructo Noise Explosion!: Live at WNUR 2-6-92 (1992)\nConstructive Destruction (1994)\nDestroy All Music (1995)\nRevenge (1996)\nLive in the Middle East (1996)\nGods of Chaos (1998)\nRetrospektiw III (1998)\n\"...The Truth Is a Fucking Lie...\" (1999)\nAlptraum (2000)\nTrauma (2001)\nInfection and Decline (2002)\nRetrospektiw IV (2002)\nSystems Emerge from Complete Disorder (2003)\nThe Void (2004)\nSpectral Warrior Mythos Volume 1 (2005)\nCataclysm (2006)\nIncarceration by Abstraction (2007)\nShattered Dimension (2019)\nImminent Death (2019)\nNegative Infinity (2021)\nTerror Iridescence (2022)\nLosing The War Inside Our Heads (2024)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nCamp Skingraft 33 Hits!

    "text": "Henri Couillaud (9 December 1878 in Bourg-la-Reine – February 1955) was a French classical trombonist.\nHe was a soloist for the Opéra de Paris, the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire and the French Republican Guard Band. He wrote studies for trombone which aimed to give students a strong technicality.\nHe was professor of trombone at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1925 to 1948 with André Lafosse as assistant professor. He succeeded Louis Allard.\nCouillaud's method (1946) emphasizes the role of air in the emission process. Couillaud promotes more concise sliding movements by using the instrument's first positions as a priority, a technique that opens up to jazz and variety music.\n\n\n== Works ==\nVingt Études de Perfectionnement\n26 Études Techniques\nTrente Études Modernes\nÉtudes de style (Trombone solo)\nEnseignement Complet du Trombone à Coulisse par Henri Couillaud; Études et Exercises\n12 Études Melodiques\n4 Études en forme de duos\n\n\n== External links ==\nComplete Couillaud Collection\nHenri Couillaud"

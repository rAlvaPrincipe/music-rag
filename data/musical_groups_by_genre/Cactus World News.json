They reformed in 2011 with a new lineup of Kearns, Sheehy and MacAndris, including Eoin Scott and Eoin Watkins. Their early influences were the Clash, Ramones, Talking Heads, U2, the Waterboys and R.E.M.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTheir first release, and best-known song was \"The Bridge\", which was produced by U2's Bono, and released on their Mother Records label. They toured the UK with The Cult in 1985 and signed with MCA Records. They performed at the Self Aid concert in Dublin on 17 May 1986. The band  released their debut album, Urban Beaches, in 1986 and gained notable hits with its three singles: \"Years Later\", \"Worlds Apart\" and a re-recording of \"The Bridge\". It has a five-star rating on iTunes USA. AllMusic gave Urban Beaches a rating of 4.5 out of 5. All three singles reached the UK Singles Chart.\nAfter their second album, No Shelter, was shelved in 1989, the band were released from their recording contract and underwent several personnel changes. MacAindris and Sheehy both quit in 1989. McEvoy and Kearns continued for a few more years, with various other band members coming and going, including Chris McGoldrick (bass), John Doyle (bass) and JJ Collier (drums).\nIn 2010, Kearns played guitar on three songs on the Australian band The Church's album Untitled #23 (\"Dead Mans Hand\", \"On Angel Street\", and \"Operetta\").

Kearns also contributed guitar to \"Love Philtre\" on the Church's 2014 album Further/Deeper.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nStudio albums\n\nLive album\n1986 – Live: Spin Magazine Concert Series\nCompilation album\n\n2015 – Found\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Facebook"

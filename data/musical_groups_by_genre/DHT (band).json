It had a hit in the US and Australia in 2005, with its cover version of \"Listen to Your Heart\", originally recorded by Roxette. The track reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart in December of that year. Marketing of the song often referenced DHT as an acronym for Definite Hit Track. On 14 June, 2019, the duo unveiled a previously unreleased album, titled #2 on Apple Music, Spotify, and other music portals.\nThey have been one of the very few artists to crack the US Billboard Hot 100 top 10 with a trance song.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nListen to Your Heart (19 July 2005)\nListen to Your Heart [Dance & Unplugged] (2-disc set) (12 August 2006)\n#2 (14 June 2019)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDHT's official website\nOfficial US Billboard chart history\nImpartproductions.com\nDHT discography at MusicBrainz"

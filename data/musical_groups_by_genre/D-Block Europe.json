    "text": "D-Block Europe, often abbreviated to DBE, is a British hip hop collective consisting of Adam Nathaniel \"Young Adz\" Williams, and Ricky Earl \"Dirtbike LB\" Banton. Their name originated after being co-signed by Jadakiss, resulting in Jadakiss launching the European stable of his record label D-Block Records, creating D-Block Europe. They started to put out tracks on their own label at the beginning of 2014. The group rose to fame in 2017 after releasing numerous singles including \"Large Amounts\", \"Darling\" and \"Nasty\".\nD-Block Europe's first album The Blue Print: Us vs. Them reached number two on the UK Albums Chart on 16 October 2020. Before their Central Cee collaboration (Overseas) debuted inside the Top 10 on 26 November 2021, D-Block Europe were the act with the most hits without a top 10, despite managing to chart 29 singles into the UK top 75. Their second album Lap 5 also reached number two on the UK Albums Chart on 30 September 2022. \nThey achieved their second top-10 single on the UK Singles Chart following their appearance on Clavish's November 2022 single \"Rocket Science\", which peaked at number 9 on the UK Singles Chart.

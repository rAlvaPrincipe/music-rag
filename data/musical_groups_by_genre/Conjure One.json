    "text": "Conjure One is a Canadian electronic music project, headed by Rhys Fulber, better known as a member of Front Line Assembly and Delerium.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter performing with Front Line Assembly at the 1996 Roskilde Festival, Fulber left the band to pursue a solo career. He set up a studio in Amsterdam; the influence of life there, and traveling to the Eastern Mediterranean, gave him the idea of an ethnic ambient project.  Soon after, a debut album was announced, though Fulber's work as a producer and remixer eventually pushed its release to September 2002.\nThe self-titled album was a fusion of the electronic characteristics of Fulber's previous work—keyboard-based, with rhythmic dance beats—and the influences of Middle Eastern music, which inspired ambient melodies more reminiscent of Delerium.\nA number of songs were more pop-oriented and featured guest vocalists, primarily Poe and Chemda, the latter singing entirely in Arabic. Marie-Claire D'Ubaldo, Sinéad O'Connor and Jeff Martin of The Tea Party were also featured.\nAfter returning to Front Line Assembly and Delerium, in 2005 Fulber released a second album entitled Extraordinary Ways. This album utilized much more contemporary sounds, including much greater prominence given to guitars and trip hop beats. Vocalists included Tiff Lacey, Poe (credited as \"Jane\"), Chemda, Joanna Stevens, and Fulber himself (covering a song by the punk band Buzzcocks).\nIn 2007, Sandra Cretu covered \"Sleep\" as a bonus track on her single \"The Way I Am\".\n2012 saw Fulber sign to Dutch dance label, Armada Music, and work began on what became the Holoscenic album.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nConjure One (Nettwerk, 2002)\nExtraordinary Ways (Nettwerk, 2005)\nExilarch (Nettwerk, 2010)\nHoloscenic (Armada Music, 2015)\nInnovation Zero (Black Hole Recordings, 2022)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Redemption\" (featuring Chemda) Promo Only (2001)\n\"Sleep\" (featuring Marie-Claire D'Ubaldo) (2002) – UK #42\n\"Tears from the Moon\" (featuring Sinéad O'Connor) (2003)\n\"Center of the Sun\" (featuring Poe) (2003)\n\"Extraordinary Way\" (featuring Poe) (2005)\n\"Face the Music\" (featuring Tiff Lacey) (2006)\n\"I Dream in Colour\" (featuring Leah Randi) (2010)\n\"Like Ice\" (featuring Jaren Cerf) (2011)\n\"Under the Gun\" (featuring Leigh Nash) (2013)\n\"Still Holding On\" (featuring Aruna) (2013)\n\"Ghost\" (featuring Kristy Thirsk) (2016)\n\"Animals\" (featuring Jaren) (2021)\n\"Wolves at the Door\" (featuring JEZA) (2022)\n\"Wheels Come Off\" (featuring JEZA) (2022)\n\"I Don't Want To Go There\" (featuring Jaren) (2023)\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nChristian Burns – \"Then There Were None\" (from the album Simple Modern Answers) (2013)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nP.O.D. – \"Youth of the Nation\" (Conjure One Remix) (2001)\nAlice Cooper – \"I Never Cry\" (Conjure One Remix) (2003)\nCollide – \"Tempted\" (Conjure One Mix) (2004)\nThe Crüxshadows – \"Dragonfly\" (Conjure One Remix) (2005)\nThe Realm – \"Lost in Space\" (Conjure One Remix) (2014)\nMully and Shvman with Rily Shay – \"Stranded\" (Conjure One Remix) (2021)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ambient music artists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nConjure One at Nettwerk Records\nMind Phaser, Front Line Assembly\nLitts, Daryl (Jan 2003). \"Rhys Fulber\".

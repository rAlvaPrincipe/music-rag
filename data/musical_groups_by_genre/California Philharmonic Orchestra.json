Beginning in 2011 the Orchestra performed at the Santa Anita Racetrack under the musical directorship of Victor Vener, the organization's founder.\nEventually, the California Philharmonic with the California Philharmonic Chorale -- popularly known as the Cal Phil Chorale -- made Walt Disney Concert Hall their home for their regular summer concerts.

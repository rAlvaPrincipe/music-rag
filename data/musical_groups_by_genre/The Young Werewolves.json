All greasers please apply.\" Attracting attention from the underground press and steady airplay on specialty radio have enabled a frequent touring schedule.\nIn 2004, their music was licensed for broadcast on the fifteenth season of MTV's popular reality television series The Real World based in Philadelphia. AMC licensed music from the band for broadcast during the network's annual Monsterfest programming during Halloween season in 2007.

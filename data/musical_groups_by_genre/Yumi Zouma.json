    "text": "Yumi Zouma ( YOO-mee ZOO-mə) are a New Zealand alternative pop band from Christchurch, Canterbury. The band consists of Christie Simpson (vocals, keyboards), Josh Burgess (guitar, bass guitar, vocals, keyboards), Charlie Ryder (guitar, bass guitar, keyboards), and Olivia Campion (drums). The band's name is an amalgamation of the two friends who encouraged the group to start writing together.\nThe group's origins trace back to their history of playing concerts together in Christchurch. However, the band did not begin writing music together until multiple members moved abroad and began collaborating over email following the events of the Christchurch earthquake. This early material gained attention within the musical blogosphere and encouraged American label Cascine to sign the band before they had played live or held a band practice.\nBetween 2014 and 2015, the group released two extended plays (EP I, EP II). The band's debut album Yoncalla was released in 2016, including the singles \"Keep It Close To Me\" and \"Barricade (Matter Of Fact)\". In 2017, the band released their second album, Willowbank, and the singles \"December\", \"Depths (Pt. I)\", and \"Half Hour\". EP III was released in 2018, including the singles \"In Camera\" and \"Crush (It's Late Just Stay)\". In 2020, the band signed to labels Polyvinyl Record Co. and Inertia Music, and released their third album Truth or Consequences, which featured the singles \"Right Track / Wrong Man\", \"Cool For A Second\", \"Southwark\", \"Lonely After\", and \"Sage\".\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career: EP I and EP II (2014–2015) ===\nFounded by Burgess, Ryder, and vocalist Kim Pflaum, the group began writing music using file sharing services when Burgess left New Zealand to work at New York-based record label Captured Tracks. The band's first release, EP I, debuted in early 2014, after the single A Long Walk Home For Parted Lovers appeared on several blogs before being quickly taken down. The band were positively reviewed by Pitchfork  and profiled by The Guardian, leading to the group signing with Brooklyn-based record label Cascine. In mid-2014, the band began playing live, touring with singer Lorde, and collaborating with other acts, such as Swedish band Air France. Guitarist Sam Perry and vocalist Christie Simpson joined the group in 2015, while Pflaum left and started the solo project Madeira (later renamed Laumė). The band released a second EP, EP II, in early 2015, and proceeded to tour extensively throughout Europe, Asia, and North America, with the likes of Jamie xx and Lower Dens.\n\n\n=== Yoncalla (2016) ===\nThe band quickly released their first full-length album, Yoncalla, the following year. As opposed to the long-distance writing of the band's earlier releases, Yoncalla consisted of material that had been finished during tours for EP II. The majority of the album's final material was recorded in Paris, France, following an American tour which stopped by the city of Yoncalla, Oregon. The band produced the album at electronic musician Philippe Zdar's Motorbass studio in Paris, enabling them to achieve a sound more akin to classic synth-pop than their previous records.\n\n\n=== Willowbank (2017) ===\nAfter a year of heavy touring in support of Yoncalla, the band travelled home to record in New Zealand for the first time. A limited edition cover of the Oasis album (What's The Story) Morning Glory? was distributed on vinyl in early 2017, before the release of the band's second album, Willowbank, in October. The sessions for Willowbank marked the first time that the group had worked together in a professional studio, with the band initially questioning whether they should \"all move into separate rooms\" to recreate the remote song writing process from previous records. However, the sessions allowed for stronger collaboration and more organic instrumentation compared to earlier material, leading to jazz musician Olivia Campion joining the band as a live drummer. Lead single Depths (Pt. I) became a success on streaming platforms, and was accompanied by a video created by illustrator Frances Haszard. Following the completion of touring for Willowbank, Perry left the band in order to concentrate on his Serbia-based musical project DOG Power.\n\n\n=== EP III (2018) ===\nIn wake of the departure of Perry, the remaining four members of the band proceeded to return to the methods of long-distance writing that had inspired their earlier material. This process led to the creation of a third EP, released in October 2018. A video for lead single In Camera was released in early 2019, directed by Pavel Brenner. A video for second single Crush (It's Late, Just Stay) was also released in 2019, directed by Robbie Barnett.\n\n\n=== Truth or Consequences (2020) ===\nAfter signing to Polyvinyl and Inertia Records, Yumi Zouma released their third studio album Truth or Consequences on March 13, 2020. The album features the singles \"Right Track / Wrong Man\", \"Cool For A Second\", \"Southwark\", \"Lonely After\", and \"Sage\".Truth or Consequences, by Yumi Zouma  Along with the album, Yumi Zouma is set to release a unique line of merchandise which includes a candle, bandana, and enamel pin. The band announced a reimagined edition of the album named Truth or Consequences - Alternate Versions, which was released in October 2020.\n\n\n=== Present Tense (2022) ===\nRelease Date: Mar 18, 2022. The fourth full-length release was recorded remotely with some in-studio sessions in Los Angeles, London, Florence, New York and New Zealand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nChristie Simpson – lead vocals, samplers, keyboards (2015–present)\nJosh Burgess - vocals, guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, drum programming, samplers (2014–present)\nCharlie Ryder - guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, drum programming, samplers (2014–present)\nOlivia Campion - drums (2017–present)\n\n\n=== Previous ===\nSam Perry - vocals, guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, drum programming, samplers (2015–2018)\nKim Pflaum – vocals, guitar, samplers (2014-2015)\n\n\n== Musical equipment ==\n\n\n=== Live concert equipment ===\nFender Telecaster guitars\nFender Bronco bass guitar\nWaldorf Blofeld sampling synthesizer\nRoland SP-404 samplers\nNeunaber Wet Reverb guitar pedals\nMalekko Analog Chorus guitar pedals\nRoland Jazz Chorus guitar amplifiers\n\n\n=== Studio recording equipment ===\nFor studio recordings, the band use their live equipment, a Sequential Prophet 600 synthesizer, and an Apogee Electronics Duet recording interface.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended Plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"A Long Walk Home for Parted Lovers\" (2013)\n\"The Brae\" (2014)\n\"It Feels Good to Be Around You\" (featuring Air France) (2014)\n\"Alena\" (2014)\n\"Catastrophe\" (2015)\n\"Song for Zoe & Gwen\" (2015)\n\"Right, Off the Bridge\" (2015)\n\"Keep It Close to Me\" (2016)\n\"Barricade (Matter of Fact)\" (2016)\n\"Short Truth\" (2016)\n\"December\" (2017)\n\"Depths (Pt.

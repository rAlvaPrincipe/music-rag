    "text": "Angelou was an English folk rock band formed in 1996 by singer-songwriter  Holly Lerski with guitarist Jo Baker, the duo taking the band's name from the author Maya Angelou or also known as Marguerite Annie Johnson .\nAngelou debuted on Boo Hewerdine's independent record label Haven Records in 1997 with the \"Hallelujah\" EP.  Joined by Phil Di Palma and Chris Evans, they followed this up with two critically acclaimed albums, Automiracles (1998) and While You Were Sleeping  (2000).\nAngelou toured Spain extensively in 2001, promoting their Spanish 'best of' release, Midnight Witcheries, with new members Cath Evans and Ann Richardson. The band returned a second time for the Benic√†ssim festival 2001 tour, promoting their \"Summertime\" EP.\nAfter their return to England they signed to Sanctuary Records and recorded their third album, Life Is Beautiful, releasing it under Holly Lerski's name. The album finally broke Lerski and her band into the mainstream through heavy radio support for their two  singles. Lerski left Sanctuary Records in 2005 through lack of support for the record. The company dissolved soon after, to eventually be bought out by the Universal Music Group.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHallelujah EP (1997)\nAutomiracles (1998)\nShe Stays\nFlesh and Blood\nHoneysuckle Again\nAutomatic Miracles\nHumble\nThank You\nLet's Go Home\nThe Mermaid Girl\nElysian Fields\nLullaby\nWhile You Were Sleeping (2000)\nSainte Genevieve\nThe Shipping News\nRise Up\nGlittering Creatures\nFall\nBitter Honey\nWhile You Were Sleeping\nCoat\nSummer Homecoming\nThis is Not a Lovesong\nLittle Sister\n\n\n== References =="

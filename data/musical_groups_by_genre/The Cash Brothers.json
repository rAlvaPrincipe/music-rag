    "text": "The Cash Brothers are a Canadian alternative country/folk rock duo, based in Toronto, Ontario, consisting of brothers Andrew and Peter Cash.  Their alt-country/alt-folk music includes ballads which blend acoustic and electric guitar work with vocal harmonies.\n\n\n== History ==\nPrior to the creation of The Cash Brothers, Andrew and Peter Cash both had established careers as songwriters and musicians.  Andrew was a member of the bands L'Ã‰tranger and Ursula, and a solo artist, and Peter was a member of Skydiggers. Although their careers were closely connected (Skydiggers, in fact, often played as Andrew's backing band at the Spadina Hotel), they had never written or performed as a duo.\nIn 1996, however, Peter left his band, and Ursula disbanded. The brothers started writing songs and performing as a duo. Their debut album as The Cash Brothers, Raceway, was recorded over time at Chemical Sound and released independently in 1999.   It was re-released in the US and in Europe by Rounder Records in 2001 under the name How was Tomorrow. The pair toured with a backup band in the UK, Netherlands and the US in support of the album.\nTheir second album, Phonebooth Tornado, came out in 2000.\nBy the time their album A Brand New Night was released in 2003, the pair had toured extensively, and were developing a more electric and pop-oriented sound.  They toured in support of the album in the US.\n\n\n== Touring band ==\nWhile on tour, the brothers travel with a backup band. Musicians who have toured with the Cash Brothers include Gord Tough, Randy Curnew, Paul Taylor and Todd Lumley.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nRaceway (1999)\nPhonebooth Tornado (2000)\nHow Was Tomorrow (2001) (re-release of Raceway)\nA Brand New Night (2003)\nSkydiggers/Cash Brothers (2006)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Cash Brothers discography at Discogs"

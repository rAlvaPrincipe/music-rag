It reached #22 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1996. It was their only UK chart hit. The flip side of the 12\" featured an a cappella version of the song, the result of this is that many white label bootleg versions have surfaced, featuring the track being played over the instrumental of another dance track.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one dance hits (United States)\nList of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chart\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJellybean recordings artist information"

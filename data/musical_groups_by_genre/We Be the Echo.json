    "text": "We Be the Echo is an American instrumental rock band from San Francisco. They play a blend of math rock, brutal prog, punk, jazz and heavy metal with dub influenced bass lines. The band's sound is based on melodic and rhythmically challenging short songs that often incorporate shred guitar. They formed in 2003 from the remnants of the Bay Area experimental band Bm Relocation Program.\nThe band members have also variously played (or continue to play) in other bands/projects including UK-based hardcore punk bands Voorhees and Break It Up, and San Francisco-based The John Francis, Desire Paths, Life Fire In Peopledom, The Mao, Drift Erratics, Bm Relocation Program and others.\n\n\n== Members ==\nGraeme Nicholls - Guitar\nMyke Stryker   - Bass\nIlk Koskelo - Drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nCubist Music EP (2004) - Chuckbeat Records\nDry Or Damp - I'm Still The Champ (2006) - Copper Press Magazine Compilation No. 27\nStanislaw Stories LP (2006) - Chuckbeat Records\nAll-Star Destroyers EP (2007/08) - Chuckbeat/Brutal Prog/Mandai\nMasks LP (2009) - Chuckbeat/Brutal Prog\nReturn To Nations LP (2011) - Chuckbeat Records\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of math rock groups\nExperimental rock\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSoundshock (UK) (Review)\nSpinning Platters (SF) (Interview)\nGrand Street News (NYC) (Live review)\nSan Fran Voice (SF) (Interview) - retrieved on October 27, 2008\nNews Review (Chico) (Article) - retrieved on October 27, 2008\nThe Owl (Review) - retrieved on October 27, 2008\n30music.com (Canada) (Review) - retrieved October 31, 2008\nBandcamp Daily (Article) retrieved July 26, 2019\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nOn youtube.com\nBandcamp"

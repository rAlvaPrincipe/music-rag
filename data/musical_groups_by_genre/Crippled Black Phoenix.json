    "text": "Crippled Black Phoenix are an English dark rock band, founded by Justin Greaves in 2004. They have released 12 main studio efforts, various Ep's and special albums and toured internationally. Besides Greaves, several musicians have contributed to Crippled Black Phoenix's discography and played with them during their live shows.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2004, Justin Greaves, previously drummer of several doom and sludge bands like Iron Monkey, Electric Wizard and Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine, began recording his own material. He was encouraged by Dominic Aitchison of Mogwai, and their ideas would lay the backbone for Crippled Black Phoenix. The name of the band was taken from the lyrics (by Johnny Morrow of Iron Monkey) of \"Big Loader,\" a song on the debut album Iron Monkey. Greaves also used \"Crippled Black Phoenix\" as a pseudonym. Band members have chiefly been drawn from other bands to which Greaves has contributed; including Iron Monkey, Gonga, Mogwai, Electric Wizard, Hearts of Black Science and others.\nGreaves and the band write what they call \"endtime ballads\" signifying both the melodic but slightly macabre nature of their songs and their unusual blend of styles, as the final evolution in music. This blend has led to them being called everything from progressive rock to dark folk, to psychedelic, to post rock/metal. Initially the band was produced by Geoff Barrow of Portishead fame, under his label Invada Records. Barrow occasionally played live in the first appearances of the band in 2007. Crippled Black Phoenix have made live shows a focus and have performed onstage - usually in a formation from 7 to even 9 members - also in peculiar venues, using folk and Victorian-era instruments in tandem with their rock elements.\nThe innate, ever ongoing evolution of Crippled Black Phoenix has reflected on multiple turnovers in his line-ups, both studio and live. Of the first versions of the band, the most relevant changes were the departures of original singer/guitarist Joe Volk, who embarked on a solo career (2012) and guitarist Karl Demata (2014), who later founded the band Vly together with departing bassist Christian Heilmann. Following the split, Greaves and Demata engaged in a legal dispute over the registered trademark of the band's name. In the second half of 2015, the issue with former guitarist was resolved and mastermind Greaves was able to continue his run under the moniker Crippled Black Phoenix, following his vision and continuing to be very prolific with different incarnations of the band and his cast of rotating musicians.\nA new phase of CBP started in 2013 with the arrival of Swedish guitarist/vocalist Daniel Anghede: a voice that Greaves confessed to have always wanted to work with, at the point he was supposed to be on the debut album of the band. As a parallel project, female singer Belinda Kordic and Greaves formed the duo Se Delan. A second project involving Greaves and Kordic was called World War, later Johnny The Boy. Another major change of CBP's path happened in 2019, when Daniel Anghede left the band after six years and a prolific run of four studio albums and extensive touring. He later announced a project (\"Venus Principle\"), a sort of CBP spin-off, with other former bandmates.\nGreaves announced in the summer of 2020 the start of a new era of the band, continuing temporarily with a main core of 4 members while in search of a new co-singer, with a more prominent role for Kordic. A brand new album, Ellengæst was released October 2020, featuring several guest vocalists. Metal Hammer named it as the 43rd best metal album of 2020. Swedish Joel Segerstedt is announced as new co-singer and rhythm guitarist at the end of April, 2021. His first recording with the band is the single \"Painful Reminder/Dead Is Dead. In April 2022, Crippled Black Phoenix announced a new full length album, Banefyre, and their first European Tour after the Covid-19 pandemic. In november, 2024 the band will celebrate his 20 years of music with a double album,The Wolf Changes Its Fur But Not Its Nature & Horrific Honorifics Number Two(2), which contains new versions of old material and covers who inspired the collective through the years.\n\n\n== Band ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nJustin Greaves - electric guitar, acoustic guitars, bass, drums (studio), saw, keyboards, banjo, effects, samples, backing vocals (2004–present)\nBelinda Kordic - vocals, percussions (2011–present)\nAndy Taylor - guitars (2018–present)\nMatt Crawford - bass (2021-present) \nJordi Farré - drums (2021-present) (live) \nLucy Marshall - piano, synth, backing vocals, artwork (2024-present)\nJustin Storms - vocals, guitar (2024-present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\n\n\n=== Collaborators, guests and live musicians ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nA Love of Shared Disasters (2007 Invada Records)\nThe Resurrectionists (2009 Invada Records)\nNight Raider (2009 Invada Records)\nI, Vigilante (2010 Invada Records)\n(Mankind) The Crafty Ape (2012 Mascot Music Production)\nNo Sadness or Farewell (2012 Cool Green Recordings)\nWhite Light Generator (2014 Cool Green Recordings)\nNew Dark Age (2015 Season of Mist)\nBronze (2016 Season of Mist)\nGreat Escape (2018 Season of Mist)\nEllengæst (2020 Season of Mist)\nBanefyre (2022 Season of Mist)\n\n\n=== Singles, Mini and Special albums ===\nSharks & Storms / Blizzard Of Horned Cats (2006 Invada Records)\nChildhood's End (with Se Delan) (2015 Self released)\nOh'Ech-oes (with Se Delan) (2015 Clearview Records)\nHorrific Honorifics (2017 Season of Mist)\nBudapest Vigilante Sessions (2017 Rad Nauseam)\nPainful Reminder/Dead is Dead (2021 Season Of Mist)\nBeautiful Destroyer (2024 Bandcamp one-off track)\nThe Wolf Changes Its Fur But Not Its Nature + Horrific Honorifics Number Two (2) (2024 Season Of Mist)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n200 Tons of Bad Luck (2009 Invada Records)\nExtra Tracks (2009 Self released)\nAn Original Album Collection (\"New Dark Age\" + \"Bronze\" box set) (2019 Season Of Mist)\nMan Confused, Vol. I-II: Various Demo Action 2004-2011, 2011-2018 AD (2020 Self Released)\nVarious Types Of Dread (A Collection Of Confusion) (2020, Self Released)\nChampions Of Disturbance - A rough guide to CBP (2021, Self Released)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nPoznan 2011 A.D.

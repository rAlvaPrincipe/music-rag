    "text": "Regg'Lyss was a French reggae group (French-language pun between \"reggae\", \"glisse\" and \"r√©glisse\").\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was established in 1989 in Montpellier (Languedoc) and gathered a dozen of friends who wanted to explore a new style, the Jamadoc, \"a musical Esperanto for a country fantasized between Jamaica and Occitania.\"\nQuickly, the group achieved local success in the south of France. After a selection at the Printemps de Bourges in 1990, the band released their first album, Vive les gestes, in 1992. Their song \"Mets de l'huile\" became one of the greatest successes in the years 1993/1994 in France, reaching number 1 twice on the French SNEP Singles Chart, and remaining for 32 consecutive weeks in the Top 50. The group was appointed to the Victoires de la Musique.\nRegg'lyss split after the release of their third album because it failed to be successful.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References =="

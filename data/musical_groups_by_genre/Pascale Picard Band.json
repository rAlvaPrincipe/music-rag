    "text": "The Pascale Picard Band is a Canadian rock group from Quebec City, formed by Pascale Picard (vocal and guitar), Philippe Morissette (bass), Marc Chartrain (drums) and Mathieu Cantin (guitar).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band first made a small appearance during a TV show on MusiquePlus in Montreal.  The station was then flooded with messages to praise the band, forcing them to be reinvited.\nMe, Myself & Us, the band's first album, was released in April 2007.  Seven months later the album was platinum in Canada with more than 100,000 sold copies.  The album's first single, \"Gate 22\", stayed in the Top 50 Anglophone chart in Quebec for 12 weeks and is in rotation on the CBC.CA Canadian singer/songwriters radio stream.\nPascale Picard, the songwriter, is at the center of the band. She was nominated for the 2008 Juno Awards in the category Artist of the year.\nIn January 2008 the band performed at the Midem, in Cannes, in the hope of opening new horizons in Europe.  The single \"Gate 22\" was released in France in March 2008 and the whole album followed in June.\nOn August 20, 2008, Pascale and her band, incidentally from Quebec, were asked by Paul McCartney's team to open for the latter's historic show on the Plains of Abraham as part of Quebec's 400th anniversary.\nDuring their 2008 Canadian tour they were supported by The Wooden Sky on the Eastern leg of the tour.\nThe band's second album A Letter to No One debuted at #4 on the Canadian Albums Chart. In February 2012, they released a soundtrack album for the third season of the television drama series Trauma, which debuted at #18 in Canada.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== A Letter to No One (2011) ===\n\n\n=== Me, Myself & Us (2007) ===\n\nProduced by the Brothers Grand\nRecorded at Wild Sky Studio, Morin Heights\n\n\n=== Charts ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPascale Picard at Universal Music\nGarage Band - Pascale Picard\nCyberpresse - Le Soleil - Pascale Picard fait bonne impression au MIDEM (in French)\nCyberpresse - Le Soleil - Le Pascale Picard Band, la petite histoire dâ€™une ascension fulgurante (in French)"

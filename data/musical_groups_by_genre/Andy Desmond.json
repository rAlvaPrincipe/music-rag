    "text": "Andy Desmond, well known as Miten, (born in August 1947 in Woking, Surrey) is a British musician known throughout the yoga and alternative healing community for his songs of redemption and transformation. He travels around the world to perform mantras and songs for his fans.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDesmond founded the folk/rock duo Gothic Horizon with musical partner Richard Garrett in the late 1960s. The band released two albums on UK Argo: The Jason Lodge Poetry Book (1971) and Tomorrow's Another Day (1972).\nIn 1973, Desmond began performing solo and became part of a stable of folk musicians which included Tom Robinson, Claire Hamill and Café Society, who were signed by Ray Davies to his record label, Konk Records. Desmond subsequently released Living On A Shoestring on Konk, featuring members of The Kinks and produced by Dave Davies and a fellow Kink member, keyboardist John Gosling.\nDuring this time Desmond became established in the UK as a singer/songwriter of note and was subsequently signed to Ariola Records in London. Ariola released Andy Desmond in 1976 - an album containing 10 self composed songs, produced by legendary Los Angeles producer Bones Howe.\nAt the time of its release Desmond had become a stalwart on the British rock scene, opening for Fleetwood Mac, Randy Newman, Hall & Oates, The Cate Brothers, The Kinks and many others.  He was invited by Fleetwood Mac to be their special guest on their UK Rumours Tour, and opened for Ry Cooder on his 1978 European tour.\nDisillusioned with the rock world and his destructive life style, Desmond left everything behind to explore meditation and Eastern philosophy. He was initiated into 'sannyas' in 1980 by controversial Indian mystic Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and given the Sanskrit name Prabhu Miten meaning 'Friend of God'. He spent many years in India at Osho's ashram in Pune, recording and producing the album 'In Wonder' - a tribute to his guru and spiritual guide. It was during this time Desmond met record producer John Leckie who, in the ashram, was known as 'Nagara'. The two became lifelong friends, resulting in many collaborations, most notably on the album 'Blown Away' for Prabhu Music. From 1992, German New Age Label, Tao Music (later New Earth Records) released three albums with Desmond titled Heartbeat, Shadow of Light and Tidal Wave.\nDesmond now tours the world with his musical and life partner, Deva Premal, whom he met in India at Osho's ashram in 1990. The couple, known as Deva Premal & Miten, are well known in the world of alternative spirituality and yoga for their chanting of Indian Sanskrit mantras and for Desmond’s spiritually inspired songs. Yoga International featured the duo in a 2009 article on Yoga Rock Stars: \"They are the Johnny and June Carter Cash of sacred music, with more than a dozen albums and a fan base that includes both Cher and the Dalai Lama.\" They have collaborated with motivational speaker Anthony Robbins, best selling author Eckhart Tolle, and pop icon Cher, who covered their version of the ancient prayer  The Gayatri Mantra on her Farewell Tour in 2002.\nDeva & Miten's record company, Prabhu Music, reports CD sales in excess of one million, and the couple travels the world continually with Nepalese bansuri maestro Manose, playing in up to 25 countries a year.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Jason Lodge Poetry Book (Gothic Horizon ), UK Argo 1971\nTomorrow's Another Day (Gothic Horizon ), UK Argo 1972\nLiving On A Shoestring, Konk 1975\nAndy Desmond, Ariola Records, 1976\nGlobal Heart, Native Soul (1996)\nStrength of A Rose (with Deva Premal) (1996)\nTrusting the Silence (with Deva Premal) (1997)\nBlown Away (1999)\nDance of Life (1999)\nSatsang (Deva Premal & Miten) (2002)\nSongs for the Inner Lover (with Deva Premal) (2003)\nMore Than Music (Deva Premal & Miten) (2004)\nSoul In Wonder (with Deva Premal) (2007)\nDownload Singles (with Deva Premal) (2009)\nDeva Premal & Miten In Concert (Deva Premal & Miten with Manose) (2009)\nDeva Premal & Miten with Manose - A Deeper Light (April 2013) co-produced with Joby Baker and Maneesh de Moor\nTemple at Midnight (2016)\n\n\n=== Producer ===\nDeva Premal - The Essence (exec producer) (1998)\nDeva Premal - Love is Space (co-producer with Kit Walker) (2000)\nDeva Premal - Embrace (co-producer with Kit Walker) (2002)\nDeva Premal - Dakshina (co-producer with Martyn Phillips and Praful) (2005)\nDeva Premal - Deva Premal Sings the Moola Mantra (co-producer with Ben Leinbach) (2007)\nDeva Premal - Password (co-producer with Rishi) (Oct 2011)\nDeva Premal & Miten with Manose - A Deeper Light (April 2013) co-produced with Joby Baker and Maneesh de Moor\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

    "text": "Sirocco is an Australian music group that began in 1980 with three musicians: Bill O'Toole, Guy Madigan and Andrew de Teliga. In 1981 Michael Atherton joined and the group recorded their first album Paths of the Wind.\nThey have been nominated for the ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Release in 1987 (Voyage), for Best Independent Release in 1990 (Port of Call) and for Best World Music Album three times, 1995 (The Wetland Suite), 1996 (Stars and Fires) and 1999 (Falling Leaf).\nThe concept of the band was to find inspiration from the numerous cultures in Australia. When Sirocco started, the music scene in Australia was classical, rock, jazz and a little folk. However, the numerous migrant cultures, such as Chilean, Turkish, Arabic and Irish, had a vibrant music culture. Sirocco tapped into this and brought many of these expert musicians into the band for guest performances.\nThe early albums and performances were known for the unusual array of instruments rarely seen outside their community, including the oud, cittern, cabrette, kaval, doumbek, and tupan. Their instruments were mixed and matched in the same way as the Australian population. Their performances were wild, always getting the audience up and dancingâ€”\"the excitement of rock and roll, the improvisation of jazz and the musicianship of classical\". Of interest, they performed at many weddings because there are many intercultural marriages in Australia. The bride and groom came from very different cultures and it was only Sirocco who could perform their music in such an Australian manner.\nThey are well known for innovation and it was demonstrated in their concert in the endangered Macquarie Marshes in 1993 and the concert with the Dayaks in central Borneo.\nSirocco now have 14 albums released and a video. They have toured over 32 countries including India (four times), Laos, Nepal and Pakistan, and were the first Australian group to tour both Russia and China.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Film/television composer or contributor ===\nCharlie's Angels \"Belly\" original song (2000)\nPerfume feature film score, directed by Michael Rymer (2001)\nUndertow Didgeridoo for feature film score by Philip Glass (2004)\nRevolution TV film score, directed by Michael Rymer (2009)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== ARIA Music Awards ===\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music.

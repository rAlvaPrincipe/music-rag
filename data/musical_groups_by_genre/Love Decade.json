    "text": "Love Decade, a.k.a. Decadance, was an English electronic music group that was formed in 1991 by producer Peter Gill, who did the production and writing on the singles that were released during its brief career. Among its members in this project were vocalist Jerome Stokes, who later recorded with N-Trance as their lead vocalist, MC Chris O'Brien, and dancers Dave Shaw and Rob Van Winkelen.\nThe song \"So Real\", on which Jerome Stokes sang lead vocals, is the group's highest charting single on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 14. It earned the act a performance on Top of the Pops in 1991, where Stokes sang live. The act's second single, and its only video for, \"I Feel You\", featured the vocals of up-and-coming artist named Abigail, who was credited on the single as Gail.\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\"Dream On (Is This a Dream)\" (1991) - UK #52\n\"So Real\" (1991) - UK #14\n\"I Feel You\" (featuring Gail) (1992) - UK #34\n\"When the Morning Comes\" (1992) - UK #69\n\"Is This a Dream '96\" (1996) - UK #39\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"So Real\" from Top of the Pops (1991)\n\"I Feel You\" music video (1992)"

    "text": "Brymir is a Finnish melodic death metal/symphonic metal band from Helsinki founded in 2006.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThey were formed in the summer of 2006 during a music summer camp under the name LAI LAI HEI (named of the Ensiferum track of the same name). After the win of a camp-competition covering the Ensiferum track \"Token of Time\", the band quickly became more serious and started to compose their own music under the current name Brymir. Their first album Breathe Fire to the Sun (2011) still held some folk metal influences, but the band has moved away from these influences in their music towards their current melodic death metal / symphonic metal sound from their second album Slayer of Gods (2016) onwards.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nViktor Gullichsen – lead vocals (2006–)\nJoona Björkroth – guitars, backing vocals (2006–)\nSean Haslam – guitars (2006–)\nJarkko Niemi – bass, vocals (2006–)\nPatrik Fält – drums (2013–)\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nJaakko Tikkanen – drums (2006–2010)\nSami Hänninen – drums (2010–2013)\nJanne Björkroth – keyboard, backing vocals (2006–2018)\n\n\n=== Live musicians ===\nPetri Mäkipää – drums (2013)\nAntti Nieminen – guitars (2017–)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBreathe Fire to the Sun (Spinefarm Records) – 2011\nSlayer of Gods (Ranka Kustannus) – 2016\nWings of Fire (Ranka Kustannus) – 2019\nVoices in the Sky (Napalm Records) – 2022\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"For Those Who Died\" (2016)\n\"The Rain\" (2016)\n\"Chasing the Skyline\" (2018)\n\"Ride On, Spirit\" (2018)\n\"Wings of Fire\" (2019)\n\"Voices in the Sky\" (2022)\n\"Herald of Aegir\" (2022)\n\"Fly with Me\" (2022)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

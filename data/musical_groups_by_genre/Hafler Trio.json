    "text": "The Hafler Trio is an English conceptual, performance and sound art collaborative project. It was originally a duo formed in the early 1980s by Andrew McKenzie and Chris Watson. The third person in the 'trio' was a fictional scientist named Dr. Edward Moolenbeek. The Hafler Trio became the solo project of McKenzie (although often working with guest artists) with a strong focus on dadaesque sound art works and multimedia work. His recordings often having carefully and elaborately designed packaging. Chris Watson went on to a critically regarded career as a field recording artist and sound engineer.\nSince, Andrew M. McKenzie's Hafler Trio project has seen the release of numerous albums and CDs in experimental musical styles ranging from electronic, cut-up, ambient, environmental soundscape, musique concrète, electro-acoustic, and audio-montage as cinema for the ears from 1982 to present, each of which use graphic design and text for contextual juxtaposition with the recordings, as well as having a diverse but concrete philosophical and sometimes quasi-religious framework to place them in.\n\n\n== History ==\nDespite the name, The Hafler Trio is essentially the work of one man, Andrew M. McKenzie, born in Scotland in 1963 and whose family moved to Newcastle upon Tyne shortly after. McKenzie released his first 7\" single at the age of 16, having formed a post-punk rock group named Flesh.\nThere have been numerous members and collaborators alongside Andrew M. McKenzie, including Cabaret Voltaire co-founder Chris Watson, the fictitious Dr. Edward Moolenbeek, Steven Stapleton of Nurse With Wound, Adi Newton of Clock DVA, Z'EV, Fluxus artist Willem de Ridder, David Tibet (of Current 93), Genesis P-Orridge, Annie Sprinkle, Jónsi Birgisson (of Sigur Rós), Michael Gira (of Swans and Angels of Light), Chloe Vevrier, Erla Þórarinsdóttir, Blixa Bargeld, Netochka Nezvanova, Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, Jóhann Jóhannsson, John Lacey of COUM Transmissions, and Autechre among many others. McKenzie was also part of Whitehouse along with Steven Stapleton and William Bennett for their first live performance.\nIn addition to the 6-part retrospective set released by The Grey Area of Mute Records titled The Golden Hammer (including many early LPs and EPs such as The Sea Org, \"Bang\" – An Open Letter, Three Ways of Saying Two, All That Rises Must Converge, Seven Hours Sleep, A Thirsty Fish and more), CD releases include: Intoutof, A Bag of Cats, Mastery of Money, How to Reform Mankind, with several notable stand-out collaborations: One Dozen Economical Stories by Peter Greenaway, Nurse With Wound and the Hafler Trio Hit Again! (collaboration with Nurse with Wound), Snuff (with Willem De Ridder), Soundtrack to Brion Gysin's 'Dreamachine' (which included detailed historical documentation and instructions for use), a substantial 2-part collaboration with Autechre, and most recently a three part collaboration with Jónsi Birgisson of Sigur Rós.\n2009 saw the shutdown of the Brainwashed h3o website, the renunciation of conventional CD releases, almost all internet activity, and the exclusive concentration on methods of \"complementary education\" and related disciplines referenced by and developed in tandem with the work of The Hafler Trio since its inception, under the umbrella of Simply Superior. The website, simplysuperior.org, became the only official source of information about The Hafler Trio and related matters.\nIn 2017, Andrew McKenzie was interviewed by the Data.Wave webzine.\n\n\n== Selected body of audio work ==\nThe Hafler Trio – An Introduction (1983, Cassette, ROBOL Sound Recordings (UK), white plastic wallet, cards, this is first release)\n\"BANG\" – An Open Letter (1984 LP, Re-issued on CD with extra material in 1994)\nSoundtrack To \"Alternation, Perception, And Resistance\" – A Comprehension Exercise (1985 12\", Re-issued as part of the 1994 CD, \"Walk Gently Through the Gates of Joy\")\nSeven Hours Sleep (1985 Double LP, Re-issued on CD in 1994 and re-issued/re-mastered again on CD in 2006)\nHotondo Kiki Torenai (1985 Cassette, Limited edition of 100)\nBrain Song (1986 12\", Limited edition of 1000, Re-issued in 1987 as the A side of a split LP with Luciano Dari titled \"Ben, Ruach, Ab, Shaloshethem, Yechad Thaubodo / Idrogeni Superiori\", Re-issued again on CD with extra material as part of the 1994 CD, \"All That Rises Must Converge\" Some of the original material actually recorded by Ema Maynard now known as Ema Lea)\nRedintegrate (1986 Cassette, Re-issued on CD in 1991)\nThe Sea Org (1986 10\", Re-issued on CD with extra material as part of the 1994 CD, \"All That Rises Must Converge\" and re-issued/re-mastered again in 2004 on CD with completely different extra material under the original title of \"The Sea Org\")\nThree Ways of Saying Two (1986 LP, Re-issued on CD with extra material as part of the 1994 CD, \"Four Ways of Saying Five\")\nA Thirsty Fish (1987 Double LP, Re-issued on CD in 1994 with fewer tracks, then re-issued/re-mastered in full on Double CD in 2005)\nDislocation (1987 Cassette, Re-issued on CD in 1990)\nNurse With Wound and the Hafler Trio Hit Again!

    "text": "Paola & Chiara (Italian pronunciation: [ˈpaːola e kˈkjaːra]) is an Italian pop music duo consisting of Paola Iezzi and Chiara Iezzi, two sisters who were born in Milan. They are the best selling female Italian group with over 6 million records sold. \nTheir national career began when the manager of Max Pezzali's pop band 883 saw the sisters playing in Milan and subsequently signed them to the band. The sisters' career as \"Paola e Chiara\" began in 1997 when they parted from 883.\nIn 1997, the sisters won the New-Artist category for the song \"Amici come prima\" at the Sanremo Festival. Soon after, they released their first album.\nThey have since released five other studio albums, incorporating shifting musical influences (such as Spanish Pop and Celtic elements) and performing in several different languages, achieving international success in 2000.\nIn July 2013, the duo released the album Giungla, which also features rappers Razza Krasta and Moreno. Shortly after the release of the album, they announced their separation. The duo reunited in 2022 and participated to Sanremo Festival the following year. Due to the great public acclaim the duo released many music singles and made several appearances.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nChiara Iezzi was born on 27 February 1973, and Paola Iezzi was born on 30 March 1974.\nThe sisters formed their first music group called Elefunky, which specialized in funky music. They played in various clubs in Milan and were discovered by manager Claudio Cecchetto, who was looking for a group that would help artist Max Pezzali.\nThe sisters left the club scene and joined up with Max Pezzali to play at many festivals in Italy. They became part of Pezzali's band 883, playing the guitar and the trombone. The group released in 1995 the album La donna, il sogno e il grande incubo. After a big tour to promote the album, the sisters decided to become solo artists.\nThe sisters visited Scotland after seeing the movie Braveheart, to visit the locations where the movie was shot. The trip was an inspiration to both and gave them a feeling of real freedom. The sisters returned to Scotland again and were inspired to write many songs.\nThey decided to participate in the Sanremo Festival new-talent search in 1996. The song \"In viaggio\" (\"In Transit\") led the sisters to win the contest, gaining fans and admiration.\nOn 4 December 2022, it was officially announced that Paola e Chiara would participate in the Sanremo Music Festival 2023. \"Furore\" was later announced as their entry for the Sanremo Music Festival 2023.\n\n\n== Music career ==\n\n\n=== Ci chiamano bambine (1997) ===\nReleased: 2 February 1997\nChart peak: #33 (ITA)\nIn 1997, after the victory in the New-Artist section of the Sanremo Festival, they released their first album, Ci chiamano bambine (\"They Call Us Children\").

They went on to release other three singles from the album: \"Ci chiamano bambine\", \"Bella\" and \"Ti vada o no\" (included in the Italian original soundtrack of the Walt Disney animated film Hercules). With \"Per Te\", they took part in the 1998 Sanremo Festival, releasing a new edition of the debut album.

It was seen as a change in style, being a mixture of Spanish Pop tunes and dance beats.\nFour singles were released from the album:\n\n\"Vamos a bailar\"\n\"Amoremidai\"\n\"Viva el amor! (Rapino Brothers Remix)\"\n\"Fino alla fine (2001 Vision)\"\nIn the summer of 2000 Paola a Chiara won the Festivalbar Best Song Award with \"Vamos a bailar\"  achieving success all over Europe, Japan and Latin America.\nThe album is also available in English and Spanish, and went on selling about 800,000 copies around the world.

According to several interviews the singers released, the song is about asking for a hand when we feel like we don't fit in or need help in this uncertain world that sometimes may look dystopian. The music video for \"Solo Mai\" recorded in 2024 at Multiset Bicocca Studio in Milan, features Italian supermodel Eva Riccobono portraying \"Mother Nature\" while wearing a fake pregnancy belly. The song was first composed during Paola Iezzi's stay in Stockholm while working on music before the reunion during the COVID pandemic with many Swedish composers and finished when the duo officially came back after they participated in Sanremo 2023.\n\n\n=== Other selected singles ===\n\n\n== DVDs ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Top ten singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial website for Chiara\nSonyBMG site\nOfficial Italian Charts"

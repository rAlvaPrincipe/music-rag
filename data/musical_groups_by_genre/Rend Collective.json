Before the formation, most of the members were part of the \"Rend\" young adults ministry at Bangor Elim Church to where Gilkeson preached and Llewellyn led worship.\" While the group comprises over 15 members, the band tours and records with 6 members. The remaining members are there for support and to encourage the band \"spiritually, musically, and missionally.\" They explained noticing a sense of hostility from the modern culture towards the church and Christians therefore sought to create music that would draw such individuals spiritually and encourage them to come back to church.\nRend Collective was on the And If Our God Is for Us... Tour with Chris Tomlin and Christy Nockels in the spring of 2011. They toured with Kari Jobe on the Majestic Tour.\nIn 2014, Rend Collective toured with the RESET Movement, as part of their musical ministry involving Lacey Sturm (formerly of Flyleaf); spoken-word artist Propaganda; worship leader Dave Lubben; DJ Efechto; International House of Prayer worship artist Matt Gilman; and singer/songwriter Morgan Harper Nichols.\n\n\n== Music ==\nCampfire includes live, outdoor recordings of songs previously released on Organic Family Hymnal and Homemade Worship by Handmade People.

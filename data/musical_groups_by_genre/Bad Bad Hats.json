    "text": "Bad Bad Hats is an indie pop band formed in 2012 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is composed of Kerry Alexander (born July 1990), Chris Hoge, and Connor Davison. The band is named after a trouble-making character in the children's book, Madeline.\nThe band has toured with notable artists including Margaret Glaspy, Hippo Campus, Third Eye Blind, The Front Bottoms, and Michelle Branch.\n\n\n== History ==\nKerry Alexander grew up in Birmingham, Alabama but moved to Florida when she was 15. She and Chris Hoge met while they were students at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota after finding each other's music on Myspace. Alexander had been performing \"scrappy folk originals\" and acoustic covers of \"All The Small Things\" by Blink-182 at solo-acoustic shows on campus. They initially joined forces to perform a duet. Once Alexander heard Hoge playing drums, she wanted to start a band, which they did in 2010. Fellow student Noah Boswell joined them on bass in 2012 at which time they formed Bad Bad Hats. The trio then started performing around Minneapolis–Saint Paul. \nIn the early days, the band alternated between acoustic and revved-up, garage-leaning rock. The band began by releasing lo-fi music demos via Bandcamp. These included kazoo solos, revised Shania Twain verses, and the indie-pop track Super America. In 2013 they released their debut EP, It Hurts. Bad Bad Hats first LP, Psychic Reader, was released in 2015 on Afternoon Records. Psychic Reader received positive reviews and resulted in more high-profile gigs, opening for bands such as Third Eye Blind and Margaret Glaspy.\nIn 2018, Bad Bad Hats released their second full-length album titled Lightning Round on Afternoon Records. This album and Psychic Reader were both produced by Brett Bullion, who helped develop the music's loose, organic feel. Shortly thereafter, Boswell left the band to attend graduate school.\nIn 2019, the band performed at South by Southwest.\nIn September 2021, Bad Bad Hats released their third LP, Walkman on Don Giovanni Records.\nBad Bad Hats released a fourth self-titled album on April 12, 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe band's music has been described as indie, pop-punk, folk, classic pop, influences by \"90s rock simplicity and pop-punk frivolity.\"\nAlexander’s lyrics have been described as relatable, sincere, subtle, honest, unpredictable, and powerful.\nBad Bad Hats describe their style has been described as \"indie rock,\" but have been described in Rolling Stone as likely to \"break into Sixpence None the Richer's \"Kiss Me\" at any moment\" and going well with a latte at Starbucks. Their songs are described as expertly produced, with hooks and intriguing turns. Their sound is very pleasing, but some critics have called for more message, urgency, and purpose.\nCritics in Pitchfork said that Psychic Reader had the same \"unconventional structure and sticky melody\" as found in Super America, but that the band's music had become richer, more varied, and more multidimensional. \nCritics in Rolling Stone said that Lightning Round reflects the same blend of indie-pop, folk, and rock, but is even more refined and polished than Psychic Reader and has a \"mid-tempo groove,\" and a richly-produced synth-pop sound reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac’s Tusk.\n\n\n== Band Members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nEPs\n\n\n== References =="

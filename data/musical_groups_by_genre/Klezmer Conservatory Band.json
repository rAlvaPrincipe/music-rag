    "text": "The Klezmer Conservatory Band is a Boston-based group which performs traditional klezmer music; it was formed by Hankus Netsky of the New England Conservatory of Music in 1980. Originally formed for a single concert, they have gone on to release eleven albums.\nNetsky is the grandson and nephew of traditional klezmer musicians. He was inspired by jam sessions with Irish musicians to attempt something with klezmer music. He recruited many of the musicians from the New England Conservatory of Music's Third Stream department with the majority having jazz or folk backgrounds.\nIn 1988, the band featured in a documentary on klezmer called A Jumpin Night in the Garden of Eden. It has also provided soundtracks for a number of films and theatrical productions including:\n\nEnemies, a Love Story\nReligulous\nJoel Grey's Yiddish music review Berschtcapades '94\nThe Fool and the Flying Ship, narrated by Robin Williams\nShlemiel the First, a musical based on a play by Isaac Bashevis Singer\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAllmusic article\nFrank London on the Klezmer Conservatory Band"

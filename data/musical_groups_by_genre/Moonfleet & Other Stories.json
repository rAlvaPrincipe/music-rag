    "text": "Moonfleet & Other Stories is the eighteenth original album by singer and songwriter Chris de Burgh, released in 2010. This album includes two parts, one including the story of Moonfleet (18 tracks), based on J. Meade Falkner's homonymous 1898 novel; and the other one, including 6 tracks, called Other Stories. The latter half of the title echoes that of De Burgh's 1975 album Spanish Train and Other Stories. For the launch of the album, de Burgh signed an exclusive deal with supermarket giant Asda for the physical release in the UK, and worked with digital companies AWAL and Topspin Media to distribute it digitally around the globe.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== Moonfleet ===\nAll songs written by Chris de Burgh and John Meade Falkner.\n\n\"The Moonfleet Overture\" -5:03\n\"The Village Of Moonfleet...\" (Narration) -1:27\n\"The Light On The Bay\" -1:57\n\"Have A Care\" -2:52\n\"For Two Days And Nights...\" (Narration) -1:14\n\"Go Where Your Heart Believes\" -4:11\n\"The Escape\" -4:19\n\"And So It Was...\" (Narration) -0:29\n\"The Days Of Our Age\" -1:54\n\"The Secret Of The Locket\" -3:32\n\"With Heavy Heart...\" (Narration) -0:36\n\"My Heart's Surrender\" -4:10\n\"Treasure And Betrayal\" -3:43\n\"Moonfleet Bay\" -3:06\n\"The Storm\" -3:23\n\"Greater Love\" -3:29\n\"In The Years That Followed...\" (Narration) -1:23\n\"The Moonfleet Finale\" -3:00\n\n\n=== Other Stories ===\nAll songs written by Chris de Burgh\n\n\"Everywhere I Go\" -3:36\n\"The Nightingale\" -3:47\n\"One Life, One Love\" -3:42\n\"Why Mona Lisa Smiled\" -3:37\n\"Pure Joy\" -3:06\n\"People Of The World\" - 3:50\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\nChris de Burgh – vocals, guitars\nPeter Gordeno – keyboards, additional backing vocals\nChris Porter – keyboards, percussion, narrator (2, 5, 8, 17)\nChris Cameron – acoustic piano, orchestral arrangements\nNigel Hopkins – accordion, Hammond organ, Moog bass, additional backing vocals\nPhil Palmer – guitars, additional backing vocals\nNeil Taylor – guitars\nGeoffrey Richardson – banjo, mandolin, fiddle, viola, whistle, additional backing vocals\nJerry Maheen – bass guitar, bassoon, additional backing vocals\nGeoff Dugmore – drums, percussion, additional backing vocals\nNick Ingman – orchestral conductor\nThe Royal Philharmonic Orchestra – orchestra\nHazel Fernandez – backing vocals\nJakko Jakszyk – backing vocals\n\n\n=== Production ===\nChris de Burgh – producer, sleeve design\nChris Porter – producer, engineer, mixing\nAndrew Dudman – additional engineer\nJoe Kearns – additional engineer\nAlex Hutchinson – art direction\nSJ Johnson – sleeve design\nKenny Thomson – sleeve design, management\nRebecca Miller – photography\nChristie Goodwin – cover photography\n\n\n=== Year-end charts ===\n\n\n== References =="

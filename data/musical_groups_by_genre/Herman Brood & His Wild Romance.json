The band got its name from the lyric \"...and I lost my mind in a wild romance\"  which they heard on the American jazz and blues singer, Mose Allison’s 1957 recording of the song Lost Mind, which was written by Percy Mayfield in 1951; both Brood and manager Koos van Dijk were fans of Allison.\nThe best known lineup of the band, which lasted between November 1977 and October 1979, was:\n\nDany Lademacher — lead guitar\nFred van Kampen (\"Freddie Cavalli\") — bass guitar\nCees \"Ani\" Meerman — drums\nMonica Tjen-a-Kwoei and Anna Dekkers (Dee Dee), together known as The Bombita's - backing vocals\nFollowing this a number of musicians, including Bertus Borgers on saxophone, joined, left and rejoined the band, however the success of the late 1970s was never repeated.\n\n\n== Band personnel ==\nThe major incarnations of the band were:-\n\n\n=== Initial lineup ===\nThe first incarnation of the band was:\n\nFerdi Karmelk, guitarist\nGerrit Veen, bassist (left to join the Dutch band The Meteors)\nPeter Walrecht, drummer\nEllen Piebes and Ria Ruiter, backing vocals\n\n\n=== Shpritsz ===\nIn 1978, at around the time of the Shpritsz tour, the lineup was:\n\nDany Lademacher, guitarist\nFreddie Cavalli, bass guitar\nCees \"Ani\" Meerman, drummer\nMonica Tjen A Kwoei and Dee Dee Dekkers backing vocals\nThis incarnation of Herman Brood & his Wild Romance scored the hits \"Saturday Night\", \"Still Believe\" (with Bertus Borgers on saxophone), \"Never Be Clever\" and \"I Love You Like I Love Myself\". Albums Shpritsz and Cha Cha from 1978 were certified gold and platinum respectively, with the platinum disc for Cha Cha being presented to Brood by celebrity bank robber Aage Meinesz.\nMeerman was replaced in October 1979 by Peter Walrecht.

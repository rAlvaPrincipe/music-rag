    "text": "Bustan Abraham (Hebrew: בוסתן אברהם) was an Israeli band playing mostly instrumental music, which existed between 1991 and 2003. Its name means \"Abraham’s garden\"; the reference to the common ancestor of both Jewish and Islamic traditions intending to imply a unifying theme. The band was called a pioneer in the realm of world music.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was born of jam sessions organized during several months by the qanun player and music promoter Avshalom Farjun, in collaboration with the violin and oud player Taiseer Elias. These sessions brought together musicians with various musical backgrounds such as Arab music, Turkish music, jazz, flamenco, western classical music, and blues. Eight musicians finally stayed to form Bustan Abraham.  They made their debut at the Israeli International Arts Festival. The band was collaborative: each member brought his own ideas and composed part of the repertoire, and although it was composed mainly of Israeli Jewish musicians, two of its members were Palestinians.\nThank to this mix, it was perceived as a symbol of bringing the two groups together. The members nevertheless always insisted on the fact that their approach was foremost a musical one. Their aim was to drag from different traditions to create an entirely new music.\nIn the years which followed the signing of the Oslo agreements, the group played in numerous concerts and festivals in Europe, Asia and United States. It also recorded with musicians of different backgrounds, like Ross Daly, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Keyvan Chemirani and Zakir Hussain. Their albums generally sold about 25 0000 copies each. Three of Bustan Abraham’s members, (Taiseer Elias, Zohar Fresco and Nassim Dakwar also performed in trio with a more specifically Arabo-Turkish repertoire, under the name of Zyriab Trio. Taiseer Elias and Miguel Herstein performed in duo under the name White Bird.\nAfter Benjamin Netanyahu became Prime Minister, in 1996, and even more after the beginning of the Second Intifada, in 2000, invitations abroad became scarcer. The band finally disbanded in 2003, as different viewpoints had emerged on the musical direction to take and as several of its musicians were increasingly busy with other projects.\nSome of its members kept on playing together on an occasional basis and four of them formed a new band at the end of 2011, Bustan Quartet. They performed in festivals in the United States and in Israel.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Permanent members ===\nYehuda Siliki – saz, until 1993, voice as a guest on the album Pictures through the Painted Window\nEmmanuel Mann – electric bass, until 1999\nAmir Milstein – western flute\nTaiser Elias – oud\nMiguel Herstein – guitar, banjo\nNassim Dakwar – violin\nAvshalom Farjun – qanun\nNaor Carmi – double bass, from 1999 on\nZohar Fresco – derbouka, riqq, daf and voice.\n\n\n=== Guest musicians ===\nDaniela Buchbinder – Cello (Pictures through the Painted Window)\nMiranda Elias – voice (Pictures through the Painted Window)\nLea Avraham – voice (Pictures through the Painted Window)\nRoss Daly – laouto, lyra, rebab (Abadai)\nSocrates Sinopoulos – kemençe (Abadai)\nKeyvan Chemirani – zarb (Abadai)\nZakir Hussain – tabla (Fanar)\nHariprasad Chaurasia – bansuri (Fanar)\nAchinoam Nini aka Noa – voice (Fanar)\nGil Dor – guitar (Fanar)\nKroitor Emil – accordion (Fanar)\nKroitor Alexander – violin (Fanar)\nAlbert Piamenta – clarinet and bass clarinet (Fanar)\nAvraham Salman – qanun, only during concerts\n\n\n=== Bustan Quartet ===\nEmmanuel Mann – electric bass\nAmir Milstein – flute\nTaiser Elias – oud\nZohar Fresco – drums\nHaggai Cohen Milo – double bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Bustan Abraham ===\nBustan Abraham (1992)\nPictures through the painted window (1994)\nAbadai (1996)\nFanar (1997)\nHamsa (2000)\nAshra (2001), compilation released for the tenth anniversary of Bustan Abraham\nLive concerts (2003)\n\n\n=== Zyriab Trio ===\nMashreq Classics (1996)\n\n\n== See also ==\nIsraeli music\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo of a Bustan Abraham concert in 1997, first part on YouTube\nSecond part on YouTube"

    "text": "Ghymes is a band consisting of Hungarians living in Slovakia, founded at the University of Education in Nitra in 1984, by musicians with different preliminary musical experiences from classical through rock and Renaissance music. Folk elements have gradually clung together with their own individual musical ideas.\nIn the year of 2000, Ghymes had the opportunity to attend two events: the World Expo 2000 in Hanover (Day of Hungary) and the official celebrations of the New Millennium in Hungary (St, Stephen's day, August 20, 2000).\nSmaragdváros (Emerald City) was produced by EMI Records and came out in Hungary in November 2000. In March 2001, it was #11 on the World Music Charts Europe.\nOn December 24, 2018, the band performed a Christmas concert, Mennyből az angyal [Angel from heaven], which broadcast on national television (Duna Televizio). The Ghymes band performed together with the Hungarian Radio's children's choir.\n\n\n== Members ==\nGyula Szarka - lead vocal, contrabass, guitar, calabash zither, fretless bass, lute, vocals\nTamás Szarka - lead vocal, violin, koboz (Hungarian lute), guitar, contrabass, fretless bass, percussion, bass drum, calabash zither, vocals\nCsaba Kún - synthesizer, vocals\nPéter Jelasity - alto and soprano saxophone, flute\nAndrás Jász - alto saxophone\nSzabolcs Nagy - synthesizer, bass drum, vocals\nTamás Széll - percussion, drums\nJános Lau - percussion, drums\nImre Molnár - contrabass, vocals\nBori Varga - alto and soprano saxophone, Turkish pipe, recorder, bassoon, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1988: Az ifjúság sólyommadár (Youth as Falcon)\n1991: Ghýmes\n1993: Üzenet (Message)\n1995: Bennünk van a kutyavér (Dog's Blood's Inside Us)\n1996: Tűzugrás (Firejump)\n1998: Rege (Legend)\n2000: Smaragdváros (Emerald City)\n2001: Üzenet (Message - latest release)\n2002: Héjavarázs (Hawkspell)\n2003: Ghymes koncert (Ghymes Concert)\n2004: éGHYMESe (Sky Thale)\n2005: Csak a világ végire...

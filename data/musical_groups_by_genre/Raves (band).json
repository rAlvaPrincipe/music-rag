    "text": "The Raves are a power pop band based in Atlanta, Georgia and were most active in the 1980s. Originally formed in 1971 and called Nod, the band consisted of three brothers (Chuck, John and Jim Yoakum) and Ken Kennedy. Unusual for that time in the Southern United States, they played original rock music in the vein of The Pretenders, Badfinger, Big Star, and other pop rock bands. In 1980 the group changed the name from Nod to The Raves. The Raves played  throughout the South including Atlanta area nightclubs: 688 Club, The Agora Ballroom, The Bistro and many other venues through the mid-1980s. The Raves also had their own local public-access television program titled \"Eh, Wot's This?\", a mix of original comedy sketches and music video which aired from 1980 to 1982. The series won a Caber award in 1981. An LP titled The Color of Tears was released on their own label later that year. The group disbanded in 1983. A CD titled Past Perfect Tense that took tracks from the Color of Tears LP and newly recorded material from 1989 was released in 1992.

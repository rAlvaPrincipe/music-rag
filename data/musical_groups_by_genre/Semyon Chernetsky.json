    "text": "Major General Semyon Aleksandrovich Chernetsky (Russian: Семен Александрович Чернецкий) was a Ukrainian-born Russian and Soviet military conductor. He is credited as the founder of modern Russian military bands. He served as the Senior Director of the Central Military Band of the People's Commissariat of National Defense of the USSR from 1924 to 1950.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nTchernetsky was born on 24 October 1881 in Odessa to a musical family. He was born Solomon Isayevich Chernetsky, a Jewish name which he russified in 1917 to Semyon Aleksandrovich. His father, Isay Aleksandrovich Shtember was a violinist and violin teacher. His mother Dora Isayevna Chernetskaya was a piano teacher. His cousin Lev would later become the bandmaster of the 8th Don Cossack Regiment of the 8th Cavalry Division based at Odessa.\n\n\n== Early musical career ==\nFrom 1892-1893, Chernetsky studied the trombone in the orchestra of the 24th Dragoon Lubny Regiment in Kishinev, Bessarabia Governorate (now Chișinău, Moldova), where his uncle Issac was the conductor. In 1900, due to the difficult financial situation of the family, after the death of his father and without graduating from college, he was sent to Kishinev to live with Issac. In Kishinev, he graduated from the music classes of the local branch of the Imperial Russian Musical Society and decided to devote himself to military music. At first he tried his hand as an assistant to his uncle, and in 1903 he himself became bandmaster of the 14th Artillery Brigade (part of the 15th Infantry Division of the Imperial Russian Army). In the same year, during the Kishinev pogrom, he participated in the organization of self-defense, and as a result was seriously wounded and lost his left eye. In 1911 he entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, which he graduated in 1917.\n\n\n== Leadership of Red Army bands ==\nIn 1918, Chernetsky joined the Red Army and was appointed as the head of the military bands of the Petrograd military district. He quickly rose through the ranks, eventually being appointed as the director of the Military Band of the Workers and Peasants Red Army in 1924. After more than 10 years in this position, he formed the Central Military Band of the People's Commissariat of National Defense, which later became the first military band to be formed in modern Russia. In 1935, together with professor Heinrich Neuhaus at the Moscow Conservatory, he created the Military Faculty of the Moscow State Conservatory, where music students get a curriculum based on the conducting and combat repertoire. On 1 August 1937, Cherneysky founded the Moscow Military Music College as a means of building and enhancing the knowledge of potential military musicians in the Red Army. On 24 June 1945 Chernetsky led the massed bands during the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 on Red Square.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1946, he suffered from a paralysis, which resulted in his retirement from active service after 25 years in the armed forces. Tchernetsky died on 13 April 1950 in Moscow. He is buried at Novodevichy Cemetery.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nChernetsky is highly regarded in the Russian military music sphere and one of the most outstanding Russian military composers in the 20th century. Depending on sources, he wrote between 100-200 marches, patriotic songs and other works in his lifetime. In addition to military marches, he also wrote some socio-political ones such as Glory to the Motherland, Lenin's Call and the March of Moscow Pioneers. Many of his military marches are the most famous and common ones used by the Russian Military Band Service, some of which have been used during Victory Day Parades and November 7 Parades on Moscow's Red Square for decades.\n\n\n== Compositions ==\nMarches\n\nLenin's Call (1924-1936)\nIndustrial March (1932)\nGTO (1933)\nBirobidzhan March (1934)\nSlow March of Military Academies of RKKA (1936)\nSlow March (1936)\nSlow March of Red Army (1936)\nMoscow Pioneers March (1936)\nCossack March (1936)\nGeorgian March (1936)\nRed Banner Komsomol March (1936)\nUkrainian March No. 1 (1936)\nUkrainian March No. 2 (1936)\nUkrainian March No. 3 (1936 or 1938)\nGeorgian Column March (1937)\nYouth March (1937)\nCavalry Trot (1938)\nRed Banner Ensemble (1937)\nMarch \"Our Homeland (1938)\nMarch \"Under the Flag of the People's Commissar\" (1938)\nFriendship of the peoples of the USSR (1939)\nParade March (1940)\nSolemn March (in honor of 20th anniversary of the Russian Cavalry Corps)\nMoldavian March (1940)\nBessarabian March (1940)\nAnatoly Krokhalev (1940)\nVictory Triumph (1940)\nSlow March of the Officer Schools (1941)\nMarch of the 1st Rifle Guards Division (1941)\nMarch \"Victory is Behind Us\" (1941)\nSlow March of the First Guards Cavalry Corps (1942)\n Slow March of the Second Guards Cavalry Corps (1942)\nSlow March of the Third Guards Cavalry Corps (1942)\nMarch of the 8th Guards Motor Rifle \"Panfilov\" Division (1942)\nSlavic March (1942)\nFanfare March of Guard Divisions (1942)\nMarch of the First Guards Rifle Division (1942)\nFor a Just Cause (1942)\nHero of Stalingrad (1943)\nHero of Azerbaijan (1943)\nJubilee Slow March \"25 Years of the Red Army\" (1943)\nMarch of the Tankists (1943)\nMarch of the Guards Mortarmen (1943)\nMarch of the Leningrad Guards Rifle Divisions (1944)\nNative Donbass (1944)\nMarch of the 53rd Rifle Guards Division (1944)\nSalute to Moscow (1944)\nVictory March (fanfare) (1944)\nThe Red Army's Entry into Bucharest (1944)\nThe Red Army's Entry into Budapest (1945)\nVictory Holiday March (1946)\nRussian March (1945)\nSlow March of the Artillery March (1946)\nSlow March of the Tankists (1946)\nMarch of the Artillery (1946)\nMarch of Guards Artillery (1946)\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHonored Artist of the RSFSR (1936)\nStalin Prize (1946)\nOrder of Lenin\nOrder of the Red Banner\nOrder of the Patriotic War\nOrder of the Red Star\nMedal \"20 Years of the Red Army\" (1938)\n\n\n== See also ==\nMilitary Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia\n\n\n== References =="

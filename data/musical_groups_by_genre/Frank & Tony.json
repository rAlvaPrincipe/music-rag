    "text": "Frank and Tony, stylized as Frank & Tony,  are an electronic music duo, formed between two Brooklyn DJ's and dance music producers, Francis Harris and Anthony Collins, from 2012 to 2017 and again from 2020. They had produced several EPs and singles independently before working together on the eponymous deep house project.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2012, the New York-based pair formed a deep house project, releasing singles on their Scissor and Thread label, founded by Harris and honing their sound at their residency at Brooklyn's The Panther Room and Output in Williamsburg, gaining the support of DJ Sprinkles and other members of the Brooklyn DJ scene, in the process. in 2014, they released their debut album, You Go Girl, which stayed true to the duo's deep house foundations while also exploring dub music.\nHarris and Collins both have long histories of churning out well received dance singles for DJs, with Harris' solo work focusing on more experimental outre composition and lush textures.\n\n\n== You Go Girl ==\nIn 2014, the group released their debut album, You Go Girl, which was widely acclaimed in publications such as The Guardian, New York Times, Resident Advisor, Fact magazine and Pitchfork media, with many of the albums singles being featured at festivals throughout 2014 and 2015. \"Villa Seurat\" became the most prominent song on the album, featured prominently in other DJ's mixes and playlists.\nThough the album's sound is influenced by nineties deep house classics, it broke new ground by exploring dub and bass music, earning the group comparisons to Basic Channel and Black Coffee, and was followed by various mixes for Fact Magazine, Resident Advisor, Fabric London and BBC Radio One. In addition, the duo played several clubs and electronic festivals across Europe and the United States.\n\n\n== Breakup and reformation ==\nFrank & Tony officially disbanded as a duo in late 2017, with Collins moving to Marseille and opening up a restaurant, while releasing music under the moniker Gant. Harris on the other hand, has continued the Scissor and Thread imprint, including releases under his own name, while running a listening bar in Gowanus, Brooklyn. Despite this, many of the duos releases are a staple of house and techno sets to this day, a testament to the groups enduring influence.\nIn 2019, Collins joined Harris for a few dates on his US tour. It was later revealed in 2020 that the duo were planning on another collaboration with an EP set to be released in the summer of 2021, according to a label news release.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBob Moses (band)\nFabric\nDeep house\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums and Singles\n\nFrank and Tony - Presents...

    "text": "James Wesley \"Red\" Holloway (May 31, 1927 – February 25, 2012) was an American jazz saxophonist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Helena, Arkansas, Holloway started playing banjo and harmonica, switching to tenor saxophone when he was 12 years old. He graduated from DuSable High School in Chicago, where he had played in the school big band with Johnny Griffin and Eugene Wright, and went on to attend the city's Conservatory of Music. He joined the Army when he was 19 and became bandmaster for the U.S. Fifth Army Band, and after completing his military service returned to Chicago and played with Yusef Lateef and Dexter Gordon, among others. In 1948, he joined blues vocalist Roosevelt Sykes, and later played with other rhythm & blues musicians such as Willie Dixon, Junior Parker, and Lloyd Price.\nIn the 1950s, he played in the Chicago area with Billie Holiday, Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Ben Webster, Jimmy Rushing, Arthur Prysock, Dakota Staton, Eddie \"Cleanhead\" Vinson, Wardell Gray, Sonny Rollins, Red Rodney, Lester Young, Joe Williams, Redd Foxx, The Moonglows, B.B. King, Bobby Bland, and Aretha Franklin. During this period, he also toured with Sonny Stitt, Memphis Slim and Lionel Hampton. He became a member of the house band for Chance Records in 1952.  He subsequently appeared on many recording sessions for the Chicago-based independents Parrot, United and States, and Vee-Jay.\nFrom 1963 to 1966, he was in organist \"Brother\" Jack McDuff's band, which also featured guitarist George Benson, who was then at the start of his career. In 1974, Holloway recorded The Latest Edition with John Mayall and toured Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. From 1977 to 1982, Holloway worked with Sonny Stitt, recording two albums together, and following Stitt's death, Holloway played and recorded with Clark Terry.\nRed Holloway died in Morro Bay, California, aged 84 of a stroke and kidney failure on February 25, 2012, one month after Etta James, with whom he had worked extensively. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== As leader/co-leader ===\nThe Burner (Prestige, 1963) with Big John Patton, Eric Gale\nCookin' Together (Prestige, 1964) with Jack McDuff, George Benson; reissued on CD as Brother Red in 1995.\nSax, Strings & Soul (Prestige, 1964)\nRed Soul (Prestige, 1965) with Dr. Lonnie Smith, George Benson\nForecast: Sonny & Red (Catalyst, 1976) with Sonny Stitt\nPartners (Catalyst, 1978) with Sonny Stitt\nHittin' the Road Again (JAM [Jazz America Marketing], 1983) with Shuggie Otis\nNica's Dream (Steeplechase, 1984) with Horace Parlan\nRed Holloway & Company (Concord, 1987) with Cedar Walton\nLocksmith Blues (Concord, 1989) with Clark Terry\nLive at the 1995 Floating Jazz Festival (Chiaroscuro, 1995 [rel. 1997]) with Harry \"Sweets\" Edison\nGrooveyard (JHM [JazzHausMusik, Germany] Records, 1996) with Matthias Bätzel Trio\nDay Dream (Tonewheel, 1997) with T.C.

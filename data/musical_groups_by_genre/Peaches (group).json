    "text": "Peaches were an Australian pop music girl group who were active in the late 1970s with Margaret Kirk on lead vocals and guitar (a.k.a. Margaret Britt, ex-The Vamps) and Sue Kirkby (ex Daughters of Zeus) on bass guitar. They were championed by record producer, Gene Pierson, who referred to them as Australia's first all-female pop band.\nTheir highest-charting single was a cover version of the Righteous Brothers' \"Substitute\", which peaked at number 15 on the Australian Kent Music Report singles chart. The song had been a worldwide hit for the all female South African group, Clout (band) in 1977.\nIn 2011, Pierson reflected “I think the timing was absolutely perfect. There were so many boy bands around then.” Peter Hood, then owner and head engineer of Atlantic Records, said Peaches had potential to be world-class stars. “They were really very good. Margaret, the lead singer, was world-class; she was better than Suzi Quatro. We thought they would be a world-wide hit.”\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Band, הלהקה, (also known as The Troupe) is a 1978 Israeli musical comedy film directed by Avi Nesher about a military band during the War of Attrition. The story dives into the hazing, intense rivalries, and romantic entanglements between veteran members and new recruits who are eager to prove themselves. The movie was initially unsuccessful but has grown in popularity over time. The character of the choir leader is inspired by the real-life composer, arranger, and music director of The Nahal Band, Yair Rosenblum.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1968, an Israeli military ensemble (based on  The Nahal Band), performs comedy and musical acts to boost morale among soldiers in combat zones during the War of Attrition. At the film’s start, three veteran members of the troupe give their farewell performance before finishing their service in the Israeli Defense Forces. The next day, auditions are held by troupe director Paul Aviv (Tuvia Tzafir) to fill these positions, resulting in the selection of three new recruits: the forward Giora Datner (Gidi Gov), the nerdy Moshe \"Bazooka\" Albuz (Meir Suissa), and the talented Noa Barron (Dafana Armoni). The veteran troupe members haze the newcomers.\nDuring a rehearsal, Leicht, the assistant musical director, unexpectedly assigns Noa a solo originally sung by the troupe’s prima donna, Yaffa (Smadar Brenner), leaving a jealous Yaffa to leave in tears. Later, while Noa and the other new recruits are helping paint backdrops for the show’s set, she breaks down after enduring cruel remarks from some of the veteran members. Zami, the troupe’s electrician, explains to Datner and Bazooka the tradition of hazing new recruits. In defiance, Datner and Bazooka decide to retaliate.\nMoments before their first performance in front of an audience, Datner and Bazooka begin their revenge plot. They damage the drummer’s set, fill the keyboard with powder, and electrocute the microphones of Yaffa and another veteran, Doron. Believing the sabotage to be part of the act, the audience erupts in thunderous laughter.\nThe next morning, before boarding a bus for a concert tour, Shuka (the troupe's drummer), Doron, Moni smear dog feces on Datner's bus seat. Sensing it’s a prank, Datner dramatically pretends to faint, causing alarm among the troupe. Micki (Liron Nirgad), a soloist and Moni’s girlfriend, confronts Moni, Shuka, and Doron, and demands they clean the seat. Once it’s cleaned, Datner winks at Micki, sparking a budding romance between them.\nDuring the journey, Dani (Sassi Kesshet), the troupe's charming and flirtatious lead singer, and Yaffa’s boyfriend, Commander Moti (Doval’e Glickman), both develop feelings for Noa, sparking a rivalry between them. Meanwhile, the shy Bazooka becomes infatuated with Dani's girlfriend, Orli (Chelli Goldenberg). Datner steps in to teach Bazooka how to navigate relationships, setting him up on a series of practice dates before he attempts to approach Orli. Datner sets Bazooka up on several dates that go poorly. \nEarly one morning, Moti announces to the troupe that they’ve been chosen to perform on a National Entertainment Army Variety show on television.  Despite the excitement for the special, tensions continue to escalate. Noa is given another solo, further intensifying Yaffa’s resentment. During the show, a piece of backdrop scenery unexpectedly falls, nearly hitting Noa. The ongoing practical jokes eventually boil over, leading to intense confrontations.\nAs the television performance draws closer, tensions within the troupe start to impact their shows, with some soldiers in the audience even walking out mid-performance. Amidst the growing drama, Alron (the troupe's officer) enforces a strict 48-hour boot camp rehearsal, led by Aviv, to prepare for the television special. He cautions the troupe that any further misbehavior could lead to a significant reduction in their ranks.\nThe long rehearsal soon takes a toll on the troupe’s performances, with exhaustion affecting everyone—especially Micki, who snaps and dumps a cup of yogurt on Aviv’s face before storming out. \nMicki is court-martialed, put on 30 days probation, and removed from both the troupe and the television special. Heartbroken and outraged over the loss of their key member, Datner leads the entire troupe in a strike, demanding Micki’s return. When Aviv refuses, he disbands the troupe on the spot and storms out to inform Alron.\nWhile awaiting Aviv's return, the veteran members, along with Datner, Bazooka, and Noa, begin bonding for the first time. During a game that combines spin the bottle with truth or dare, secrets and confessions come to light. Benjamin Razon, a quiet member of the troupe, comes out as queer; Datner reveals he lost his virginity to Micki; Mali discovers her best friend, Sari, has been betraying her; and Bazooka finally gets his long-awaited dream kiss from Orli.\nFurious over the chaos in rehearsal, Alron angrily confronts Datner, Dani, and Moti about the trouble they’ve caused. As punishment, he announces that the troupe’s television special is canceled and that each member will be reassigned to different army bases. During the lineup to receive new assignments, Zami, who has overheard everything, intervenes to stop the split, holding Alron, Aviv, and assistant Shula accountable for the troupe’s issues. To make his point, he humorously dumps two cups of yogurt over himself. Laughter erupts and the commanders reconsider, and the television special is back on. The full troupe, including Micki, stays together as they head into rehearsals with renewed unity.\nAt the film’s conclusion, the Troupe is shown performing live on television, singing Shir LaShalom and inviting the audience to join them on stage.\n\n\n== Cast of characters ==\nGidi Gov as Giora Datner\nLiron Nirgad as Michal (Micki) Ben Tov\nMeir Swisa as Moshe Albez\nSassi Keshet as Dani Stav\nDov Glickman as Mordechai (Moti) Helperon\nSmadar Brenner as Yafa \"Yafchuk\" Harish\nDafna Armoni as Noa Baron\nGali Atari as Malka Levy\nChelli Goldenberg as Orly Ne'eman\nGilat Ankori as Sarah \"Sari\" Liechtenstein\nTuvia Tzafir as Paul Aviv\nYoni Chen as Doron\nEli Gorenstein as Zamar \"Zami\" Klein, aka Antenna\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"The Band\" - The full film is available on VOD on the website for the Israel Film Archive - Jerusalem Cinematheque\nThe Band at IMDb"

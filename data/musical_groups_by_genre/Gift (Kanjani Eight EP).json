    "text": "\"GIFT\" is a triple-single released by the Japanese boyband Kanjani Eight—stylized Kanjani∞. The three singles are the band's 11th, 12th, and 13th singles. The songs were released  during the Christmas period. Each single release, except \"Green\", contains two songs; Green has three songs. Each single has cover art reflecting the color theme of each single. GIFT was advertised as a gift from the group members to their fans. The three singles were sold at a special price of ¥888 and were a limited-press release.\nThe \"GIFT\" singles have seven Christmas-themed songs; some were written or composed by members of the group. Shota Yasuda designed the label for the single; Kanjani8 collectively photographed the backstage activities and  provided creative ideas for the jacket design. Like the previous singles since \"It's My Soul\", member Tadayoshi Okura dresses as Santa Claus as the singles' joke for this release. He appears in the outfit on \"Gift ~Green~\", completing the group picture that spans the backs of all three singles.\nOn December 29, 2009, it was announced that Kanjani8 had broken an Oricon record by having three singles released on three consecutive days, and monopolized the top ten weekly rankings by reaching the top three. This was the first time an album or single release had done this. When they were asked about it, member You Yokoyama said, \"Being the first to have a three day consecutive release and be the first to have it in the top 1, 2, 3 spots make me really happy\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== White ===\n\"Fuyu Koi\" (冬恋, \"Winter Love)\n\"Kimi no uta wo utau\" (君の歌をうたう, \"I'll sing your song)\n\n\n=== Red ===\n\"I wish\"\n\"Minus 100 do no Koi\" (マイナス100度の恋, Minus 100 Degrees Love)\n\n\n=== Green ===\n\"Yuki wo kudasai\" (雪をください, Please give me snow)\n\"One day in winter\"\n\"Snow White\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References =="

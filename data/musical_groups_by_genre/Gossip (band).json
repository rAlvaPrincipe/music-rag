    "text": "Gossip (or the Gossip) is  an American indie rock band from Searcy, Arkansas, formed in 1999. For most of their career, the band has consisted of singer Beth Ditto, multi-instrumentalist Nathan \"Brace Paine\" Howdeshell, and drummer Hannah Blilie. After releasing several recordings, the band broke through with their 2006 studio album, Standing in the Way of Control. A follow-up, Music for Men, was released in 2009. The band played a mix of post-punk revival, indie rock, and dance-rock. Their fifth album, A Joyful Noise, was released in May 2012. They disbanded in 2016 but reformed to embark on an anniversary tour for Music for Men in 2019 and released the album Real Power in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early history ===\nGossip was formed in 1999 in Olympia, Washington, by vocalist Beth Ditto, guitarist Nathan \"Brace Paine\" Howdeshell, and drummer Kathy Mendonça.\nAll three were originally from Searcy, Arkansas; Mendonça moved to Olympia to attend Evergreen State College and Howdeshell and Ditto followed. Howdeshell and Mendonça had been in bands together in Arkansas. Gossip coalesced when the three members were roommates in Olympia.\nIn 1999, the independent record label K Records released Gossip's first recording, their debut EP The Gossip, to coincide with the band's tour with Sleater-Kinney.\nGossip played at the first Ladyfest in Olympia in August 2000 and was included in Time magazine's article on the festival.\nTheir next record was the debut studio album That's Not What I Heard, released by the label Kill Rock Stars on January 23, 2001. They followed it with the EP Arkansas Heat on May 7, 2002. Movement, their second studio album, was released on May 6, 2003. In November 2003, two months after the release of their first live album Undead in NYC on September 9, drummer Kathy Mendonça left the band to pursue a career as a midwife. Established punk drummer Hannah Blilie joined to replace her. The band then dropped \"The\" from their name, continuing as plain \"Gossip\".\nThe first release featuring new drummer Hannah Blilie was the band's next album, Standing in the Way of Control. It was released on January 24, 2006, on Kill Rock Stars and later in 2006 on UK independent label Back Yard Recordings. The record was produced by Ryan Hadlock, owner of Bear Creek Studio, and Fugazi singer/guitarist Guy Picciotto.\n\n\n=== 2007–2011: Mainstream success and moving to a major label ===\n\nThe album Standing in the Way of Control has earned Gold Record Status in the UK. Gossip's first UK TV appearance was on BBC1's Friday Night With Jonathan Ross, where they performed the title track \"Standing in the Way of Control\".\nAs reported on Pitchfork in March 2007, the group signed to Music With a Twist, a subsidiary of Sony Music Label Group, concentrating on LGBT music acts.\nDuring the summer of 2007, Gossip was a part of the multi-artist True Colors Tour 2007, which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada. Hosted by comedian Margaret Cho and headlined by Cyndi Lauper, the tour also included Debbie Harry, Erasure, Rufus Wainwright, The Dresden Dolls, The MisShapes, The Cliks, and special guests. Profits from the tour went to benefit the Human Rights Campaign.\nGossip is based in Portland, Oregon and has played with bands such as Sleater-Kinney, Le Tigre, CSS, Erase Errata, Mika Miko, Panther, Comanechi, and Mates of State. They also opened for Scissor Sisters on three dates of their November 2006 tour.\nOn June 24, 2007, Gossip closed the Glastonbury Festival, playing the final set on the John Peel stage during which Ditto gave a tribute to the late John Peel. The band also performed the following year, on the Pyramid Stage.\nGossip launched their Live in Liverpool album in the UK and the U.S. in April 2008. The album was produced by Rick Rubin and also features a DVD of their live performance. A new studio album called Music For Men was released in June 2009. The first single from the album, \"Heavy Cross\", was especially successful in Germany where it was certified triple gold for selling over 450,000 copies, and was mentioned as the \"most successful internationally produced single\" of all time in September 2010. In January 2011 the single broke the German record for the longest-selling track in chart history. By January 14, 2011, it had spent 82 consecutive weeks on the German Top 100.\n\n\n=== 2012–2016: A Joyful Noise, split ===\nOn March 12, 2012, the band's comeback single, \"Perfect World\", was unveiled on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show. Their fifth studio album, A Joyful Noise, produced by Xenomania's Brian Higgins, was released in late May. The band's music had evolved and become poppier. Andy Gill, writing in The Independent, welcomed the result, whereas Pitchfork's review was more negative. A second single, \"Move in the Right Direction\", was issued in May. During the summer, the band headlined various festivals.\nIn an interview with Pitchfork in February 2016, Ditto confirmed the split of Gossip. She stated that she intended to focus on her clothing line and music as a solo artist.\n\n\n=== 2019–present: Tenth anniversary tour and Real Power ===\nIn March 2019, Ditto announced the band's return with a show in late July 2019 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Music for Men. This later expanded into a world tour. The band played their final show of the tour at Rote Fabrik in Zurich, Switzerland on August 19, 2019. In October 2020, Ditto shared a photo to her Instagram page of herself with Paine and Mendonça in the studio together.\nIn November 2023, the band announced their second reunion and shared a new single, \"Crazy Again\". The song is lifted from their sixth album, Real Power, which was announced simultaneously and subsequently released on March 22, 2024.\nIn an interview with the BBC in March 2024, Ditto talked about how she invited Howdeshell when she was struggling to record her second solo album with Rick Rubin at his studio in Hawaii. Working together, the album progressed into a Gossip record, and after a hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trio of Ditto, Howdeshell, and Blilie completed Real Power, their first album in twelve years.\nThe same year, Gossip embarked on a European and North America tour, including headlining at the Woodsies stage at Glastonbury.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe band's style has been described as \"a soul or gospel\" voice with \"a sort of funky punk soundtrack\". Members of Gossip have stated a liking for rock bands like the Birthday Party, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Nirvana, and The Raincoats, but also for other genres such as dance and hip hop.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\n\nBeth Ditto – vocals, piano (1999–2016, 2019–2020, 2023–present)\nNathan \"Brace Paine\" Howdeshell – guitar, bass, keyboards (1999–2016, 2019–2020, 2023–present)\nHannah Blilie – drums (2004–2016, 2019–2020, 2023–present)\nCurrent touring musicians\n\nTed Kwo – bass (2024–present)\nBijoux Cone – keyboards, guitar (2024–present)\nPast members\n\nKathy Mendonça – drums (1999–2003, 2020)\nFormer touring musicians\n\nChristopher Sutton – bass (2009–2013, 2019–2020)\nGregg Foreman – keyboards (2012–2013, 2019–2020)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nThat's Not What I Heard (2001)\nMovement (2003)\nStanding in the Way of Control (2006)\nMusic for Men (2009)\nA Joyful Noise (2012)\nReal Power (2024)\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2010: nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for \"Outstanding Music Artist\" for their album Music for Men during the 21st GLAAD Media Awards.\nJune 18, 2012, the single \"Move in the Right Direction\" was named BBC Radio 2's Record of The Week.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nGossip at AllMusic \nGossip discography at Discogs \nGossip discography at MusicBrainz"

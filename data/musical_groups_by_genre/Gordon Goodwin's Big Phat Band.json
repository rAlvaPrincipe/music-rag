    "text": "Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band, or simply The Big Phat Band, is an 18-piece jazz orchestra led by Gordon Goodwin that combines the big band swing of the 1930s and 1940s with contemporary music such as funk and jazz fusion. Since its origin, the Big Phat Band has received several Grammy Awards and many Grammy nominations.\nIts first album, Swingin' for the Fences, was the first recording released on DVD-Audio and the first DVD-Audio to be nominated for two Grammy Awards.\nWhen he founded the Big Phat Band in 1999, Goodwin was working in Hollywood as a composer for Warner Brothers cartoons. His first attraction to big band music was at the age of 13 when he heard Count Basie.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Saxophones ===\nEric Marienthal – 1st alto saxophone, soprano saxophone, piccolo, flute\nSal Lozano – 2nd alto saxophone, clarinet, piccolo, flute\nBrian Scanlon – 1st tenor saxophone, clarinet, flute\nJeff Driskill – 2nd tenor saxophone, clarinet, flute\nJay Mason – baritone saxophone, bass clarinet, flute\n\n\n=== Trumpets ===\nWayne Bergeron – 1st trumpet\nDan Fornero – 2nd (split lead) trumpet\nMike Rocha – 3rd trumpet\nDan Savant – 4th trumpet\n\n\n=== Trombones ===\nAndy Martin – 1st trombone\nCharlie Morillas – 2nd trombone\nFrancisco Torres – 3rd trombone\nCraig Gosnell – bass trombone\n\n\n=== Rhythm section ===\nGordon Goodwin – piano\nWill Brahm – guitar\nKevin Axt – bass\nRay Brinker – drums\nJoey DeLeon – percussion\n\n\n=== Temporary players ===\nDan Higgins – 1st alto saxophone (Swingin' for the Fences)\nRay Brinker – drums\nGrant Geissman – guitar (Swingin' for the Fences, XXL, The Phat Pack, Act Your Age)\nCarl Verheyen – guitar\nLuis Conte – percussion\nDennis Farias – 1st trumpet (Sing Sang Sung)\n\n\n=== Previous Players ===\nBernie Dresel - drums\nBob Summers - trumpet\nCraig Ware - bass trombone\nColin Meyer - trombone\nAlex Iles - trombone\nWillie Murillo - trumpet\nAndrew Synowick - guitar\n\n\n=== Featured soloists ===\nArturo Sandoval\nBrian McKnight\nChick Corea\nDave Grusin\nDave Siebels\nDavid Sanborn\nDianne Reeves\nEddie Daniels\nJames Morrison (musician)\nJohnny Mathis\nJudith Hill\nLee Ritenour\nMarcus Miller\nMichael Brecker\nNathan East\nNikko Paolo Silangcruz\nPatti Austin\nRomain Guyot\nTake 6\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSwingin' for the Fences (Silverline, 2000)\nXXL (Silverline, 2003)\nThe Phat Pack (Immergent, 2006)\nBah, Humduck!

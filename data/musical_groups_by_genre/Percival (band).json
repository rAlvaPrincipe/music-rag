    "text": "Percival or Percival Schuttenbach is a Polish folk metal band from Lubin, formed by musicians due to their fascination with history and historical reenactment in 1999. The name \"Percival\" refers not to any historical figure, but to the gnome named Percival Schuttenbach from Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher series of novels. The leaders of the band are Mikołaj Rybacki and Katarzyna Bromirska. They became known for their song Lazare which was used as a song for the soundtrack of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt video game.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe band plays traditional songs of Europe, mostly Slavic, and its own compositions referring to Early Medieval times, such as the Vikings era and pagan Europe.\nMusicians play traditional instruments: long-necked lute (saz or Bağlama), byzantine lyra (rebec), drums, and flutes.\nPercival presents its music during historical events in Poland (e.g. the biggest Viking and Slavic festival in Poland on Wolin island), as well as abroad in Germany, France, Czech Republic, Lithuania,  Slovakia, Belgium, Isle of Man and Scandinavia.\nIn 2010, the musicians began cooperation with music producer Donatan. Project \"Equinox\" (Polish: Równonoc) combines traditional Slavic sounds with hip-hop music. They ended their relations in 2013, over a financial dispute.\nOne of Percival's songs, inspired by the game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, for which they also wrote music, was added to an e-book, Sezon Burz, by Andrzej Sapkowski.\n\n\n== Albums ==\nEiforr - CD - 2007\nOj Dido - CD - 2008\nSłowiański Mit o Stworzeniu Świata (Slavonic Myth of Creation) - CD - 2009 \nSlava!

    "text": "Software was a German electronic duo active from 1984 to 1999, originally composed of Michael Weisser and Peter Mergener. The duo formerly used the name Mergener & Weisser.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group released their records under the IC (Innovative Communication) label, which also released a number of other electronic musicians, including Klaus Schulze and the Neue Deutsche Welle group Ideal.\nDuring a brief hiatus from 1990 to 1992, Weisser produced four albums using the Software name with a different group composition: Fragrance with Klaus Schulze and Georg Stettner, and Modesty-Blaze I / II and Cave with Billy Byte (Stephan Töteberg).\nAfter the dissolution of Software in 1999, the two musicians went their separate ways: Peter Mergener continues to compose and play electronic music, while Michael Weisser first founded the group G.E.N.E. (Grooving Electronic Natural Environments), and is currently, among other things, active as a media artist.\nThe project released one other album in 2007. In September 2017 Weisser without Mergener released six albums under the Software name. Earlier that year, Vaporwave artist George Clanton re-released the band's 1988 album Digital-Dance on his 100% Electronica label.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMichael Weisser – (1984–1999, 2007, 2017)\nPeter Mergener – (1984–1990, 1992–1999)\nBilly Byte – (1990–1993)\nKlaus Schulze – (1990–1992)\nGeorg Stettner – (1990–1992)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nMergener & Weisser\n\nBeam Scape (1984)\nPhancyful Fire (1985)\nChip Meditation I (1985)\nChip Meditation II (1985)\nElectronic Universe I (1985)\nNight-Light (1986)\nSoftware\n\nPast-Present-Future I (1987)\nPast-Present-Future II (1987)\nSyn-Code (1987)\nDigital Dance (1988)\nElectronic Universe II (1988)\nSoftware Visions (1988)\nKassettenbuch Dea Alba (1988)\nVisions (1989)\nLive-3rd Dimension (1989)\nOcean (1990)\nFragrance (1990)\nModesty-Blaze I (1991)\nModesty-Blaze II (1992)\nSoftware Visions (1992)\nSpace Design (1993)\nCave (1993)\nTen Years (1994)\nBrain Food Music (1994)\nHeaven to Hell (1995)\nSky-Dive (1997)\nFire-Works (1998)\nMystic Millennium I (1999)\nMystic Millennium II (2000)\nSpring Visions (2007)\nSpace World (2017)\nSacral World (2017)\nOcean World (2017)\nErotic World (2017)\nElectronic World (2017)\nDea Alba (2017)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nWebsite of Peter Mergener (German)\nWebsite of Michael Weisser (German)\nSoftware discography at Discogs\nSoftware on Progressive archives"

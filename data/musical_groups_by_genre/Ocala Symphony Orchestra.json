    "text": "The Ocala Symphony Orchestra, formerly known as the Central Florida Symphony Orchestra and Ocala Festival Orchestra, is a professional per-service orchestra in Ocala, Florida, U.S.A. \nThe orchestra had its beginning in Ocala, Florida in 1975, when a group of dedicated musicians and public-spirited citizens set about to organize a symphonic orchestra for the area. A four-concert season was initiated that has expanded today into over two dozen performances throughout the year. The Symphony was incorporated on February 17, 1976, and was granted 501 (c) 3 status in August 1977. After a variety of performance venues including a period at the Central Florida Community College, and the Ocala Breeder's Sales Pavilion, the orchestra led a $3.5 million fund-raising campaign to renovate the Ocala City Auditorium into the Reilly Arts Center. The Orchestra continues to manage the venue and in 2020 embarked on a $4.5 million expansion project that will be complete in November 2021.\nThe Ocala Symphony Orchestra is under the direction of Maestro Matthew Wardell. Wardell is in his 15th year as a music director and conductor of the OSO and has nearly a decade of experience as an interim director of orchestral studies, visiting lecturer, associate / assistant conductor, adjunct faculty member, and visiting artist at universities and colleges.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOcala Symphony Orchestra\nReilly Arts Center"

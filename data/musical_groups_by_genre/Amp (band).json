    "text": "Amp are an English electronic space rock band formed in London by Richard F. Walker (also known as Richard Amp) in 1992, after collaborating with David Pearce of Flying Saucer Attack on The Secret Garden and the Distance projects. Amp recorded the audio cassette/short story Green Sky Blue Tree with Ray Dickaty (subsequently a member of Moonshake and Spiritualized, amongst others), while Walker was studying at the Royal College of Art in 1992. After a two year break, Amp resurfaced with French vocalist Karine Charff, Bristol experimentalists Matt Elliott (Flying Saucer Attack and later The Third Eye Foundation), and Matt Jones (Crescent) on board. MC Strong in 'The Great Indie Discography' described Amp as \"Occupying musical territory somewhere between shoegazing and the Bristol 'Trip Hop' sound, AMP had created a work of sweeping soundscapes, echoing ambience and waves of feedback.\"\nJones and Elliott left to pursue their own projects by 1997. Since then, Amp has worked with Charff and Walker and a succession of collaborators, including:\n\nGuy Cooper and Gareth Mitchell of The Secret Garden, who worked with Amp on Astralmoonbeamprojections (1997)\nRobert Hampson (Loop/Main), who worked as producer on Stenorette (1998)\nOlivier Gauthier, on Stenorette and L'Amour Invisible (2001)\nJan Zert, on L'Amour Invisible (2001)\nMarc Challans on US (2005)\nRay Dickaty, on Green Sky Blue Tree (1992), US (2005), Transmissions (Phase 1) (2005), All Of Yesterday Tomorrow (2007)\nDonald Ross Skinner (a collaborator of Julian Cope and former member of Baba Looey), on US (2005), Motus (2008), Oetinger Villa (2009), Outposts (2011)\nWalker has also released solo records as \"Richard Amp\" and \"Amp Studio\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\nGreen Sky Blue Tree (1992)\nSirenes (1996)\nAstralmoonbeamprojections (1997)\nPerception (1997) Darla US, Ampbase UK\nPasse Present (1997)\nStenorette (1998)\nVV.AA. - A Tribute to Spacemen 3 (1998)\nSaint Cecilia Sinsemilla (2000)\nL'Amour Invisible (2001)\nUS (2005)\nTransmissions (Phase 1) (2005)\nAll Of Yesterday Tomorrow (2007)\nMotus (2008)\nOetinger Villa (2009)\nOutposts (2011)\nLive At Corsica Studios (2013)\nSwitched On And Live (2016)\nQ Factors (A Mixtape) (2017)\nEntangled Time (2018)\nEchoesfromtheholocene (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nofficial Amp website\nAmp page at bandcamp.com website\nAmp page at discogs.com website\nAmp page and biography on Apple Music"

    "text": "Payushchie Trusy (Ukrainian: Пающіє труси/Pajuqiě trusy; lit. Singing Pants, Russian: Поющие трусы/Pojuqiě trusy, lit. Singing pants) is a Ukrainian girl group. The band was formed by Ukrainian music producer Andriy Kuzmenko (more known as Kuzma) in 2008, and consists of Iryna Skrinnyk and Olena Slysarenko. Payushchie Trusy came to international attention after taking part in New Wave Festival in July 2010 with the song \"Plastic Surgeon\", for which they received a Special Prize. Media describes the band as a \"sensation in the world of show business, glamour and fashion\", while the members themselves describe their music as a \"caustic parody at the contemporary pop music\".\nThe name of the band is a corruption of Russian: поющие трусы (the actual Ukrainian term would be \"співаючі труси\"). The Russian term \"singing panties\" is a popular sarcastic reference to the proliferating scantily-clad girl groups with poor vocal abilities and undemanding lyrics in late Soviet and the subsequent post-Soviet pop music scene.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Album ===\n2009 — Popsa\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nPayushchie Trusy at the Last.fm"

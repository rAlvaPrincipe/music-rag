    "text": "The Dead Air Fresheners are a Portland, Oregon-based experimental and post-punk musical group with a somewhat fluctuating membership. They have been described by Portland's KPSU as \"A long-time mainstay of the Experimental Rock Scene.\" They count Sun Ra, John Cage, Sonic Youth, Sun City Girls, and Jandek as influences.\n\n\n== Band history ==\n\nThe band formed around 1996. They claim to have first formed \"in a dilapidated beachfront mansion on the Eld Inlet in Thurston County, Washington\" (Eld Inlet is the site of The Evergreen State College); in any event, they first performed publicly in 1997 at Olympia, Washington's annual Olympia Experimental Music Festival.\nTheir instrumentation has been known to include Moog synthesizer, and tape samples, drums, ambient vocals, distorted feedback, electric guitar, computers and digital toys, and digeridoo. The Dead Air Fresheners state in interviews and on their My Space page that they do not play improvised music despite frequent perceptions to the contrary. Rather they use a process of Chance Music composition influenced by the work of John Cage (also called Indeterminate music) and their Myspace page provides several examples of scores from past performances.\nThey have done several live radio performances; portions of their hour-long session with poet Chuck Swaim on KEXP's \"Sonarchy Radio\" were included as songs in the self-released album Pleasure Is Where All Labor Ends and two performances on KPSU are on that station's archives.\n\n\n=== Band members ===\nThe band has consisted of members based in Bellingham, Olympia, Seattle, Salem, and Portland. The three core members are located in St. Johns, Portland. Because of their penchant for anonymity, masks, and costumes, there is no definitive list of the group's membership. Nonetheless, several publications covering either the experimental music scene or entertainment in the Pacific Northwest have reported them to have included at various times members of such bands as Olympia's now defunct Karp, Austin, Texas' ...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead, Bellingham, Washington's Noggin, and Portland, Oregon's Nice Nice.\nIn Signum magazine, writer Tiffany Lee Brown implies strongly that Olympia Experimental Music Festival founder Jim McAdams is one of the anonymous musicians in the group. Matt Driscoll of the Weekly Volcano (South Puget Sound) states this outright. Emily Pothast in The Wire states that Ricardo Wang, host of the \"What's this Called?\" program on Freeform Portland Radio is a member. This was confirmed in a 2023 St. Johns Review article. Wang's two sons are also considered regular members.\nMcAdams's wife, Deanne Rowley McAdams, died 3 August 2011. Her obituary in The Olympian indicates that she was a member of the group, and that she had also played with Texas and Pacific Northwest bands Plain Jane, [...And You Will Know Us By the] Trail of Dead, Pro-Ex Marauders, and Cherry 2000, and that she had a band of her own called Leopards.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nI Try To Show My Love, Plastic Duck Records, 1999\nVerses of Echo, Bastard Customer, and Pleasure Is Where All Labor Ends, with poet Chuck Swaim, (self-released) 2001–2003\nAn Ulcer is a String of Pearls, 2006, Kill Pop Tarts (CDR-ep)\na Slip Inside the Quiet Room, 2007, Icky Recordings\nSeparated by Commas, 2010, Dubuque Strange Music Society (collaborations with various other artists; CDR)\nExtension Cord Symphony 9, (Postmoderncore, 2016)\nFast Radio Bursts, Personal Archives (Dubuque, Iowa, 8 August 2016)\nEvidence of Superstructures II (Postmoderncore, 2017)\nBrother Calls (Postmoderncore, 2019)\nCome On Get Happy (Kill Pop Tarts, 2021)\nHere’s to Letting Go, Bob Bucko Jr. with the Dead Air Fresheners (Kill Pop Tarts, 2021)\nA Collection of Drone & Noise Sea Shanties (Personal Archives, 2021) \nThe Last Asteroid (Kill Pop Tarts, 2022)\ntape hiss is the blow job of lo-fi (Kill Pop Tarts, 2022)\nNoise + Air = Noir, Noisepoet Nobody & Dead Air Fresheners (Kill Pop Tarts 2022) \nUnfriended (Personal Archives 2022)\nTales from the Elusive Hangar  (Kill Pop Tarts 2023)\nAlso included in compilations:\n\nInfamous Polywogs Vol. 1?, Inlet Recordings, 2002\nInfamous Polywogs Vol. 2?, Kill Pop Tarts, 2004\nReek of Influence, Icky Recordings, 2006\n\"Five Minutes in Dog Years\" track on compilation Winter Copulation 2016 (SDM-032), SadoDaMascus Records (Portland, Oregon, 2016)\nSource for discography (except as noted):\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBaxter, Jason (22 September 2010), \"Thursday, Sept. 30: Dead Air Fresheners\", Weekly Volcano, South Puget Sound, retrieved 28 September 2010.\nBlanchard, Josh (11–17 January 2007), \"We, Anonymous: The Secret History of Dead Air Fresheners\", Portland Mercury, retrieved 17 September 2007.\nBrown, Tiffany Lee (2007), \"Bleepy-Bloopy Noises: Creepy-crawly creatures emerge for the Olympia Experimental Music Festival\", Signum magazine, Issue, vol. 12, archived from the original on 15 November 2007, retrieved 17 September 2007.\nDriscoll, Matt (2008), \"7 on 7 and others: EXPERIMENTAL dead air fresheners\", Weekly Volcano, South Puget Sound, archived from the original on 13 November 2023, retrieved 2 February 2008.\nPortland Mercury staff (2007), band page for Dead Air Fresheners, retrieved 17 September 2007.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nDead Air Fresheners MySpace page\nRecordings by Dead Air Fresheners on the KPSU archives.\nKMLP archive including a 2002 performance by the Dead Air Fresheners.

    "text": "Dot N Pro (sometimes Dot & Pro), are an American record production duo from New York City, New York consisting of S. Dot and Pro, also known as APro and Pro Da Genius. They have produced for artists including Diddy, Jeremih, 2 Chainz, Tyga, Mack Maine, and DMX.\nBefore becoming acquainted, they produced on separate hip hop projects, resulting in an inadvertent competition. For instance, they both produced most of the songs on Cory Gunz' mixtapes Best Kept Secret and Youngest In Charge. They subsequently formed the duo after recognizing their joint talents. In 2011, they appeared on Cory Gunz' MTV docu-series, Son of a Gun. They also produced the theme song for the show, and musically directed the live series finale.\n\n\n== Production credits ==\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDot N Pro on Twitter \nDot N Pro at AllMusic\nDot N Pro on Tumblr\n\n[[Category:Record production duos]"

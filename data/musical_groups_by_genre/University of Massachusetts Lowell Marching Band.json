Past performances included exhibitions for United States President Bill Clinton, also for Governors of Massachusetts, and other state dignitaries as well as at band festivals and televised performances seen by audiences of thousands. \nThe marching band's musical program was specially arranged for the ensemble by Lutz, drawn from the classics, jazz, rock and popular idioms.

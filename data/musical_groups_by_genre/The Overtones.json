    "text": "The Overtones are a UK-based vocal harmony group. They were discovered by a Warner Bros. Records talent scout while working as decorators in a shop near Oxford Street, singing during their tea break. Their first album, Good Ol' Fashioned Love, entered the UK Albums Chart at #16 in November 2010. After its re-release in March 2011, it reached #4. More than 500,000 copies of their first album have been sold.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe members were originally in a band called DYYCE, which then reformed as Lexi Joe, which formed the basis of The Overtones. With four members originally – Mark Franks, Mike Crawshaw, Darren Everest and Timmy Matley – the band had been performing for several years. The four all shared an interest in the doo-wop genre of the 1950s mixed with R&B and modern pop music. Their voices bear a strong resemblance to a 1980s' doo-wop boyband, 14 Karat Soul. After auditioning on The X Factor in 2009, as Lexi Joe, they were rejected from the final 24. Later, they met Lockie Chapman, discovered similar tastes in music and reformed themselves as a five-piece band, under the name of The Overtones. Everest then had the idea of starting a painting and decorating company so that the five could practice together while working. It was while painting a shop near Oxford Street in London that the band was discovered by a talent scout, while singing \"The Longest Time\". They later signed a 5-album deal with Warner Bros. Records.\n\n\n=== Good 'Ol Fashioned Love (2010-2012) ===\nThe first album by The Overtones has a number of original tracks written by the band, including their first single \"Gambling Man\", the title track \"Good Ol' Fashioned Love\" and \"Carolyn\". In 2010, they made a number of high-profile public appearances, supporting Peter Andre on tour, and performing at Stockport's Christmas lights switch-on and at the Abbey Park fireworks display in Leicester. They have made a number of television appearances, including on This Morning.\nOn 13 March 2011, they were the house band for week 10 on the ITV show Dancing on Ice. On 1 June 2011, they were the house band for the third semi-final on the ITV show Britain's Got More Talent. In November 2011, they performed on The Saturday Night Show when the presenter Brendan O'Connor had to hold up a curtain after a \"terrible mishap occurred in the RTÉ studio\". The incident, available on YouTube, was nominated for the \"Brown Trousers Moment\" award at the 2011 Erics.\nOn 29 September 2012, they appeared in an episode of Red or Black? being part of a round by using a handkerchief in their performance. On 9 December 2012, they appeared as special guest performers in the final episode of series 9 of The Xtra Factor.\n\n\n=== Higher and Saturday Night at the Movies (2012-2014) ===\nIn mid-2013, they announced the release date of their third album, Saturday Night at the Movies. It was released on 4 November 2013.\nIn early 2014, The Overtones went on a UK tour, stopping in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 20 February.\nThey toured with Sir Cliff Richard in Germany in May 2014.\n\n\n=== Sweet Soul Music and Good 'Ol Fashioned Christmas (2015-2017) ===\nIn November 2014, The Overtones announced the release of their fourth studio album, Sweet Soul Music. It was released on 27 February 2015, with a brief tour commencing in June. Their fifth album and first Christmas album, Good Ol' Fashioned Christmas, was released on 27 November 2015, with a Christmas tour following in the UK.\nIn 2016, The Overtones toured with the stage show \"That's Entertainment\", a show featuring music from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Later in 2016, The Overtones announced on their Facebook page that they would be touring from November to December, with their \"Christmas with The Overtones Tour\". On 21 November 2016, Matley announced via Twitter that he would not be joining the rest of the band on tour, having been diagnosed with skin cancer in September 2016. As he progressed through his treatment, Matley returned for the band's touring commitments in 2017 and the band began recording its sixth studio album.\n\n\n=== Matley's death and The Overtones (2018) ===\nOn 9 April 2018, the band made an announcement stating that Matley had died. In order to grieve, all touring commitments were initially cancelled, except for a planned gig at the University of East Anglia, which had already been put back by three months due to Matley being ill. The gig then served as the band's first performance as a four-piece, and was billed as a tribute to Matley, with Chapman in particular performing a rendition of \"Rainy Night in Georgia\" dedicated to him. The group's fifth studio album, which was in the process of recording prior to Matley's death, was then finished, and released on 19 October 2018 on the band's own label Gambling Man Records. \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\" includes vocals recorded by Matley's before his death. \nThe band then engaged in a Christmas tour throughout November and December 2018, which included a tribute to Matley. It was later revealed that Matley died from multiple traumatic injuries sustained in a fall from a balcony.\n\n\n=== Chapman's departure and Jay James arrival (2019) ===\nOn 24 April 2019, Lachie Chapman announced that he would be leaving the band to pursue other commitments, citing his decision was partly due to the band \"not feeling the same\" since Matley's death. His last performance with the group took place on the Isle of Wight on 4 May 2019. \nOn 30 June 2019, the group released a teaser, confirming that following Lachie's departure, a new member of the group would be unveiled. The same day, the band unveiled former The X Factor contestant Jay James as Lachie's replacement. Jay's first performance with the group then took place twelve days later at Potters Resorts, Gorleston-on-Sea, preceded by the group's first release as the new line-up: a cover of Earth, Wind & Fire's hit \"September\". In November 2019, the group released a Christmas EP including September, and three covers of well known Christmas songs.\n\n\n=== 10 and the Good Times tour (2020-present) ===\nIn early 2020, the band announced a 'Summer Celebration' tour, which was set to take place in May/June 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was cancelled, and instead the band used the time to record material for what would become their sixth studio album, '10'. '10' was released on 30 July 2021. Celebrating ten years of the group, the album features re-recorded versions of the group's biggest hits, plus new original material including \"Amigo\" and \"Rose Tinted\", plus collaborations with Michael Ball and Marisha Wallace. \nA '10 Year Anniversary Tour' was announced to accompany the album, initially set to take place in November/December 2021. However, due to ongoing fallout from the panic, the tour was moved to May/June 2022, but due to unforeseen circumstances, was ultimately cancelled. In November 2022, the band released a cover of Neil Diamond's \"Sweet Caroline\" in support of England's participation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. \nIn 2023, the group announced their first UK tour in four years, entitled the \"Good Times\" tour. The tour, taking place throughout November and December 2023, is the group's biggest tour to date, with 27 dates, and is supported by the release of a new, original Christmas single entitled \"Christmas Everyday\".

Led by Eddy Conard they had hits with their versions of   Soul Cha Cha\", and \"Theme from Shaft\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nBand leader Eddy Conard is from Gary, Indiana. Growing up he was obsessed with Isaac Hayes' hit song \"Theme from Shaft\". It was apparently the first record he purchased. Moving to Holland he studied sociology and he became a resident there. A percussionist from the age of twenty he played in bands who supported acts such as The Supremes, The Stylistics, Natalie Cole and Crown Heights Affair. He had a big hit in Holland with his version of Van McCoy's \"Soul Cha Cha\". Apparently a remark by a Dutch disk jockey gave him the encouragement to record his version  of \"Theme from Shaft\".\nIn 1982, Conard had some success with the single, \"You Are Unique\". Credited to Eddy Conard & The American Dance Band, it charted for five weeks in the Netherlands.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Soulchacha aka Soul Cha Cha ===\nThe group covered Van McCoy's song, \"Soul Cha Cha\", but had the title as \"Soulchacha\". It was backed with \"In the Night\". Both sides were produced by Jacques Zwart. It was released in the Netherlands on Philips Philips 818 237–7. The single peaked at no. 24 in the Dutch charts during the first quarter of 1984. It was also a hit in Belgium, spending a total of three weeks in the chart there, peaking at no. 28.\n\n\n=== Theme from Shaft ===\nEddy and the Soulband recorded their version of the \"Theme from Shaft\" which was released in the UK in 12\" format on Beat Records 308467  (Hot Pursuit Mix), and in 7\" format on Club JAB 11.\nOn the week of January 26, 1985, the 12\" Hot Pursuit Mix version which was issued on Break 308467 made its debut in at no. 50 in the Record Mirror Disco chart.

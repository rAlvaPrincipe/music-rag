The current line up of King King is Alan Nimmo (guitar and lead vocals), Stevie Nimmo (guitar and vocals), Jonny Dyke (keyboards), Zander Greenshields (bass) and Jon Lodge (drums).\nTheir name comes from a former blues club, King King in Los Angeles, which burnt down and was immortalised in a live album by The Red Devils.\n\n\n== History ==\nKing King was formed in the summer of 2008 in Glasgow, Scotland. with the line up of Alan Nimmo (guitar/vocals), Lindsay Coulson (bass), Dale Storr (keyboards) and Dave Raeburn (drums). Their first gig was on 19 July 2008 at Rock Haven in Lincoln. Their first record release was in December 2008, entitled Broken Heal, it was a four track EP on Superb Duck Records, consisting of three self-penned numbers and a cover of the Luther Ingram song, \"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to be Right\".\nAfter building up a solid fan base over the succeeding months, the band appeared at two blues festivals in the summer of 2009. The first was at the Blues on the Farm Festival in Chichester, in June 2009, followed by an appearance at the Maryport Blues Festival in July 2009. At this festival, BBC Radio 2 DJ Paul Jones interviewed both Alan Nimmo and Lindsay Coulson for his blues show, which was broadcast on 31 August 2009. Four months later, on 14 December 2009, King King played their first full session on the Paul Jones Show, the first of several sessions. Having signed to Alan Robinson Management in August 2009, the band began recording sessions for their debut album in 2010. Also, in that year, the band played at the Monaghan Rhythm and Blues Festival in Ireland. Such was the positive reception to their set, that festival organiser, Somhairle MacGognil remarked, \"King King aren't just playing the festival. King King are the festival!\"\nKing King's debut album, Take My Hand, was released on 28 March 2011 on Manhaton Records. The album featured two drummers, Craig Blundell and Wayne Proctor (Aynsley Lister), (who would later become the band's permanent drummer). Keyboards were shared between Dale Storr and Bennett Holland. The album was released under the moniker of \"King King featuring Alan Nimmo\", as were the band's gigs at this time. At the Newark Blues Festival in 2012, the album won the British Blues Album award, whilst the band themselves won the Best British Blues Band award.\nAfter relentless touring over the next year, including regular visits to Europe, the band released their second album Standing In The Shadows, in March 2013. The first gig ever in Germany took place at the famous topos Club in Leverkusen on 30 November 2012. Wayne Proctor and Bennett Holland were now the sole drummer and keyboard players, respectively, on this album.

    "text": "Dale Underwood is an American saxophonist best known for his 30-year career with the U.S. Navy Band through which he influenced the further development of the classical saxophone audience and repertoire.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in 1948, Underwood grew up in Cortland, New York. He began saxophone at age nine and first studied with Alfred Fabrizio, and later Bob Carabia. Underwood attended Homer High School and during these years his teachers included Charles Roberts, Kenton Briggs, and Joseph Rioden. During this time, the Ithaca College band performed at Homer High School, and featured saxophonist Donald Sinta on Maurice Whitney's Introduction and Samba.  This occasion greatly influenced Underwood.\nIn anticipation of attending college for music education, Underwood began clarinet studies, as being a saxophone major was uncommon at this time. His clarinet teacher was Donna Yacavone, who had recently graduated from Ithaca College and incidentally studied with Donald Sinta. After hearing Underwood's advanced ability on the saxophone, Yacavone connected Underwood with Sinta.  While in high school at age 15, Underwood traveled with Yacavone to Ithaca, NY, to study with saxophonist Donald Sinta. Underwood studied with Sinta for two years.  Underwood's career goals shifted from music education to music performance.\nUnderwood graduated from high school in 1966.  In the fall of 1966 he attended Onondaga Community College in Syracuse, NY.\n\n\n== Performing career ==\nIn the spring of 1967, he took an audition at Armed Forces School of Music in Norfolk, VA and was accepted.  Underwood enlisted in the U.S. Navy May 1, 1967. He entered the Navy School of Music, then officially joined the Navy Concert Band on July 1, 1968. By the fall of 1969, Underwood had established himself the saxophone soloist with the band.\nUnderwood's unique talent attracted the interest of composers who sought to write solo features for him to perform. Among these were Urban Carvalho's Song and Dance; Clare Grundman's Concertante; and Claude T. Smith's Fantasia.\nUnderwood performed for every U.S. president from Lyndon B. Johnson until William J. Clinton.\nUnderwood held his position as saxophone soloist with the US Navy Band until his retirement from the military in 1997.\nUnderwood's US Navy career, in combination with a wealth of guest soloist and recital appearances, has taken him to 49 states and many countries including Canada, Cuba, Brazil, England, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, Sweden, Italy, China and more. He performed with Boston Pops Orchestra, the National Symphony Orchestra, Australian Wind Orchestra, and the National Conservatory Orchestra in São Paulo, Brazil, among many others.\n\n\n== International Saxophone Symposium ==\nUnderwood established the International Navy Band Saxophone Symposium in 1978. This annual event features numerous internationals guest artists, concerts, recitals, lectures, and master classes.\n\n\n== North American Saxophone Alliance ==\nUnderwood was president of the North American Saxophone Alliance from 1988 to 1991.

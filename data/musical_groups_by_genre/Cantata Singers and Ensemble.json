    "text": "The Cantata Singers and Ensemble is a choir and orchestral ensemble located in Boston, Massachusetts. Founded in 1964 to perform and preserve the cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach (a body of works largely unknown in Boston at that time), the group has since expanded its scope to include repertoire from the 17th century to the present day. Their performances have included semi-staged operas and a series of seasons centered on a single composer – Kurt Weill, Benjamin Britten, Heinrich Schütz, and Ralph Vaughan Williams.\n\n\n== Music Directors ==\n\n\n== Commissioned Works ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

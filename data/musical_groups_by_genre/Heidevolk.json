    "text": "Heidevolk (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈhɛi̯dəˌvɔlk]) is a folk metal band from the Netherlands. The lyrical themes of their music are inspired by nature, the history of Gelderland, and Germanic mythology. Most of their lyrics are in Dutch; however, on their 2015 album, Velua, they have one original English song, \"Vinland\", and several English covers. Their 2018 album, Vuur van verzet, contains two English-language songs: \"A Wolf in My Heart\" and \"The Alliance\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHeidevolk was founded under the name Hymir in 2002. They later changed their name to Heidevolk (Dutch for 'heath-folk' or 'heather folk'), inspired by the Veluwe landscape. The band started performing live in 2003. They have since released one demo, six full-length studio albums, and one EP.\nTheir third album, Uit oude grond, was released to generally positive critical acclaim, with one writer calling the album \"A hugely enjoyable release combining aggressive metallic riffage with tastefully entwined traditional folk instrumentation and melody\".\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\nVocalists Mark Bockting and Joris Boghtdrincker have contributed vocals to the Arkona song \"Na Moey Zemle\" (На моей земле) (In My Land). The track also features vocalists from Månegarm (Sweden), Obtest (Lithuania), Menhir (Germany), and Skyforger (Latvia). Each sings in their native language, playing the role of warriors from that region, describing their homeland to a traveler.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nJacco de Wijs (Jacco Bühnebeest) – vocals (2015–present)\nDaniël Wansink (Daniël den Dorstighe) - vocals (2021-present)\nKoen Romeijn (Koen Vuurdichter) – guitar (2015–present)\nMat van Baest (Mat Snaerenslijper)– guitar (2020–present)\nRowan Middelwijk (Rowan Roodbaert) – bass guitar (2006–present)\nKevin van den Heiligenberg (Kevin Houtsplijter) – drums (2022–present)\n\n\n=== Past ===\nJoris Boghtdrincker – vocals (2002–2013)\nJesse Vuerbaert (Ohtar) – vocals (2002–2005)\nNiels Beenkerver – guitar (2002–2005)\nPaul Braadvraat – bass guitar (2002–2006)\nSebas van Eldik (Sebas Bloeddorst) – guitar (2002–2011)\nJoost Westdijk (Joost den Vellenknotscher) – drums (2002–2022)\nReamon Bomenbreker – guitar (2005–2015)\nMark Splintervuyscht – vocals (2005–2015)\nStefanie Speervrouw – violin (2007–2008)\nKevin Vruchtbaert – guitar (2012–2015)\nLars Vogel (Lars Nachtbraeker) – vocals (2013–2020)\nKevin Storm – guitar (2016–2018)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDe strijdlust is geboren (2005)\nWodan heerst (EP, 2007)\nWalhalla wacht (2008)\nUit oude grond (2010)\nBatavi (2012)\nVelua (2015)\nVuur van verzet (2018)\nWederkeer (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nHeidevolk's channel on YouTube"

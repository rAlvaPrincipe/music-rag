    "text": "Onuka (\"granddaughter\" in Ukrainian) is a Ukrainian electro-folk band. The project was created in 2013 by Yevhen Filatov and Nata Zhyzhchenko. Other group members are Daryna Sert (keyboardist and backing vocalist), Mariia Sorokina (percussionist) and Yevhen Yovenko (banduryst). The band's instrumentation includes electronic drums, trombones, French horns and Ukrainian folk instruments bandura and sopilka.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Ukrainian word onuka translates to \"granddaughter\", a tribute to lead singer Zhyzhchenko's grandfather and folk music instrument maker Oleksandr Shlionchyk. Zhyzhchenko started her music career as a member of the band Tomato Jaws, a band that she started with her brother. Tomato Jaws were active for 11 years. Several of its songs were remixed by Filatov's band The Maneken, ultimately leading to the creation of Onuka. Lead singer Nata Zhyzhchenko believes that she can revitalize old traditions and classic folk instruments (such as the bandura and sopilka), which disappeared in the Soviet times.\nOnuka's debut album was released on October 15, 2014, and it became the best-selling record of the month in Ukraine's iTunes. Their first EP, Look, was released on May 15 and debuted at #1 in iTunes Ukraine. They released a second EP, Vidlik on February 8, 2016. Zhyzhchenko cites the Chernobyl disaster and its impact on Ukraine as a major influence on the album. The EP's name, Vidlik, means a new beginning, or countdown.\nIn 2017, Onuka was featured in an interval act at the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest, performing with the NAONI folk orchestra.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nOnuka was nominated for the Ukrainian Yuna Music Awards in the Discovery of the Year category.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nOnuka's channel on YouTube"

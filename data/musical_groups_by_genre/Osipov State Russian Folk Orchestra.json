    "text": "The N. P. Osipov State Russian Folk Orchestra (Государственный русский народный оркестр имени Н. П. Осипова) is a Russian folk music orchestra. It was founded in 1919 by the balalaika player B. C. Troyanovski. \n\nThe orchestra was renamed after Nikolai Petrovich Osipov who led the orchestra from 1940. He was succeeded by his brother Dmitri Osipov from his death in 1945 to his brother's death in 1954.\nSucceeding Nikolai Kalinin in the 21st century as leaders of The Osipov State Russian Folk Orchestra have been Vladimir Ponkin (2005-2009), and Vladimir Andropov (2009–present). Playing only upon traditional Russian instruments, the orchestra presents ethnic Russian music in a style more similar to classical music.\nPast soloists include:\n\nNina Vysotina (soprano),\nAnatoli Safiullin (bass),\nBoris Nikolaev (bass),\nVyacheslav Kobzev (bass)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Russian)\nOfficial website (in English)"

    "text": "Battle Tapes is an American electronic rock band, based in Los Angeles, California, United States, formed in late 2010. The band consists of Josh Boardman (vocals, guitar, synthesizer), Riley Mackin (keyboards, programming, vocals), Josh D'Elia (bass guitar, backup vocals) and Pete Kraynak (drums, percussion). Battle Tapes is known for its live performances, fully sequenced lighting and visuals and integrating electro and indie influences into its music and image.\nTo date, Battle Tapes has released four EPs: Sleepwalker (2011), Sweatshop Boys (2012), Solid Gold (2016), and Form (2017). They released their first studio album Polygon on November 20, 2015. They have released several singles: Valkyrie (Radio Edit) (2015), No Good (2017), Weight of the World (2019), If Only (2022), In Too Deep (2022), One Night in Burbank (2023), and Brand New (2023). Their second studio album Texture was released on May 5, 2023.\nBattle Tapes gained increased popularity in 2013, when their song \"Feel the Same\" from the Sweatshop Boys EP was featured in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V, on the in-game radio station Radio Mirror Park. The band also gained additional popularity in 2018, when several of their songs were featured in the Rooster Teeth web series Gen:Lock, with \"Belgrade\" used as its main theme.\nBattle Tapes made their festival debut in 2014, performing at The Sunset Strip Music Festival in Los Angeles, as well as SXSW in Austin, Texas. In early 2015, Battle Tapes announced they would be playing at the BottleRock Napa Valley Festival in May later that year.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays (EP) ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Remixes (by other artists) ===\n\n\n=== Remixes (by Battle Tapes) ===\nSome of these remixes were never officially released on any streaming platforms.\n\n\n== Skeleton Crüe ==\nJosh Boardman and Riley Mackin often perform as a duo under the moniker \"Skeleton Crüe\" — a name derived from the stripped-down size of Battle Tapes, focusing more on a live DJ-style use of drum machines, samplers and synths, in addition to traditional DJ decks.\n\n\n== In other media ==\nTeen Wolf (season 3, episode 4) - \"Made\"\nGrand Theft Auto V - \"Feel the Same\"\nElementary (season 2, episode 4) - \"Sleepwalker\"\nNational Geographic Channel (Ad Campaign) - \"Sweatshop Boys\"\nBBC One - Casualty (Series 32 finale promo) - \"Feel the Same\"\nNeed for Speed (Trailer) - \"Feel the Same\"\nThe Originals (season 1, episode 17) - \"Feel the Same\"\nNBC Sports (Formula 1/Monaco GP) - \"Feel the Same\"\nState of Affairs (season 1, episode 12) - \"Feel the Same\"\nNeed for Speed (drift races) - \"Valkyrie\"\nAsphalt Xtreme - \"Belgrade\"\nLucifer (season 1, episode 2) - \"Valkyrie\"\nBones (season 9, episode 14) - \"Sweatshop Boys\"\nNow You See Me 2 - \"Belgrade\"\nGirls - \"Solid Gold\"\nLethal Weapon - \"Made\"\nThe Crew 2 - \"Dreamboat\" & \"Mulholland\"\nAsphalt 9: Legends - \"Valkyrie\"\nS.W.A.T. - (season 3, episode 14) - \"Made\"\nGen:LOCK (Web series) - \"Belgrade\" (Main theme), \"Syntax\" (season 1, episode 2), \"Alive\" (season 1, episode 3), \"Sweatshop Boys\" (season 1, episode 4), \"Last Resort & Spa\" (season 1, episode 4), \"Weight of the World\" (season 1, episode 8)\nXbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 (Announce Trailer) - \"Feel the Same\"\nThe Blacklist (season 4, episode 21) - \"Last Resort and Spa\"\nHyper Scape - \"Feel the Same\"\nInvincible (TV series) (episode 5) - \"Alive\"\nThe Naked Director (season 2 trailer) - \"In Too Deep\"\nThe Flash (2014 TV series) (season 6, episode 3) - \"Made\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRockstar Network - Battle Tapes interview\nBattle Tapes\nRave's Faves - Battle Tapes\nBottleRock band of the day - Battle Tapes\nBattle Tapes Website"

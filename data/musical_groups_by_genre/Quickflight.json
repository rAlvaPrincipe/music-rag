    "text": "Quickflight was a new wave band formed in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. The band released two albums in the early 1980s Breakaway on Tunesmith and their second Decent Beat on Star Song Records.\n\n\n== History ==\nQuickflight's musical style on their first album, Breakaway, was similar to keyboard-oriented, electronic, arena rock bands of the 80s mixed with new wave and was released on Tunesmith Records in 1980.\nTheir second album, Decent Beat, was recorded at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and was released by Star Song Records in 1983. It was ground-breaking because it was one of the first Christian Contemporary releases in which the instruments used consisted almost entirely of synthesizers and sequencers in a style influenced by British synthesizer bands, particularly After the Fire. The album was also one of the first Christian Contemporary Music albums that was digitally mastered although it was never released on CD.\nQuickflight toured through the Mid-West and West Coast of the U.S. and parts of Canada, at several outdoor festivals, playing with a variety of Christian artists who included Steve Taylor, Rez Band, Kerry Livgren, Sheila Walsh, Undercover and Larry Norman.\nThrough recording at Little Mountain, Ric deGroot met the members of the Capitol Recording group Strange Advance and joined them in 1984. Paul Iverson, an early member of Strange Advance, plays bass on one track on Quickflight's second album, Decent Beat.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nRic deGroot\nDale Dirksen\nGreg Johnson\nGary Hendricks - drummer\nPete Cordalis\nDoug Giesbrecht- bass\nMike King\nadditional musicians\n\nPaul Iverson\nScotty Hall\nChris Livingstone\nRuth Shareski (Evenden)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nBreakaway (Tunesmith Records, 1980)\n\"Breakaway\"\n\"Pink Shirts\"\n\"Atheist\"\n\"Feelin' Sad\"\n\"OK\"\n\"Shuttle\"\n\"Modern Romans\"\n\"Rendezvous\"\n\"Between the Lines\"\n\"Fine Line\"\n\"I Saw You\"\nDecent Beat (Star Song, 1983)\n\"Water of Life\"\n\"Remote Control\"\n\"In the World\"\n\"Safety in Numbers\"\n\"System Breakdown\"\n\"Fantasy\"\n\"Fade to Glory\"\n\"Messages\"\n\"D.M.X.\"\n\"Metro Alien\"\n\"I Dream\"\nMusical Production: Ric deGroot\nAudio Production: Ron Obvious\nExecutive Producer: Bob Brooks\nArt Direction & Design: Joan Tankersley\nIllustration: Denise Chapman\nLayout: Lori Cooper\nSource: Ric deGroot, Star Song Records\n\n\n== References =="

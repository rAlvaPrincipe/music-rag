    "text": "Raw Fusion was an American spin-off project from Digital Underground emcee Money-B, with DJ talent provided by DU contributor DJ Fuze. Their albums contained cameos by many of the Digital Underground crew, including Shock G (as himself, Humpty Hump, and the Piano Man) and 2Pac. The group gave a more raw, hardcore feel than the funky styles that typical Digital Underground albums projected, pulling away from their Funkadelic and Parliament roots. Tracks put out under the Raw Fusion name tended to be more experimental, and had less of the flow, that was typically found in other tracks to which Money-B and DJ Fuze had contributed. The group released two albums before disbanding.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\nLive from the Styleetron (1991)\nHoochiefied Funk (1994)\n\n\n== References =="

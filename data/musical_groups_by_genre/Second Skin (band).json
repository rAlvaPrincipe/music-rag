    "text": "Second Skin is an American gothic rock band formed in 1991 by singer-songwriter Arron, the frontman of the Seattle-based band, Flesh of my Flesh. Second Skin's sound has been described as \"a culmination of punk aggression, early Gothic sensibility and Death Rock driven passions\" with \"hard rhythmic beats and dark backdrops.\"\nFeatured in Mick Mercer's Music to Die For, a listing of bands that were influential in the gothic rock scene, as well as Oskar Terramortis' upcoming This is Gothic Rock book (to be released in 2013), Second Skin has played alongside Rozz Williams (of bands Christian Death and Shadow Project), the Mission UK, the Misfits, Killing Joke, Andi Sexgang, Gary Numan, Missing Persons, Modern English, Human Drama, The Damned, and New Model Army, and has been featured on over 30 studio albums, EPs and compilations.\nSecond Skin's single \"Liberata Me\" inspired the film of the same name, Liberata Me, which won best short subject at the New York Film festival. The film featured music and a cameo by Second Skin. Director Pearry Reginald Teo then cast Arron of Second Skin to play the gatekeeper of purgatory in the follow-up, award-winning film Children of the Arcana.\nSecond Skin is also the first band to produce a darkwave/deathrock 3D music video.\nSecond Skin's latest release, Illa Exuro in Silentium, the band's fourth studio album, is the follow-up to the band's 2005 album Black Eyed Angel.\nIn August 2013, it was announced that Second Skin's fifth studio album will be released in the fall of 2013.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHymns for the Hollow – 1993, Euphoria Productions\nChoir Invisible – 2000, Euphoria Productions\nBlack Eyed Angel – 2005, Palace Of Worms Records\nIlla Exuro in Silentium – 2007, Palace Of Worms Records\n\n\n== Limited release tour EPS and singles ==\nThe Scourging and the Crowning – 1991, Euphoria Productions\nTease – 1998, Euphoria Productions\nSkin Samples (dance remixes) – 2000, Euphoria Productions\nFlesh Wounds – 2002, Euphoria Productions\nTaste of Angels – 2003, Euphoria Productions\nLiberata Me – 2004, Euphoria Productions\nThe Club Mixes – Flesh Wounds – 2005, Euphoria Productions\nI The East – East Vs.

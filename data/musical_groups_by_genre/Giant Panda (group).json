    "text": "Giant Panda is an underground hip hop group from Los Angeles, California. Giant Panda is composed of three childhood friends known by the individual stage names Newman and Maanumental (from Seattle), and Chikaramanga (from Tokyo).\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe trio's name refers to their ethnic and cultural make-up. The first single released was \"88 Remix\" independently in December 2002, with airplay across the globe. Their follow-up was the 12-inch single \"With It\" in September 2004 on Tres Records. \"With It\" received critical acclaim from print critics, such as Chairman Mao from XXL. 2005 saw the release of Giant Panda's first full-length, Fly School Reunion (Tres Records). Fly School Reunion received positive reviews in magazines such as URB (4 1/2 stars), XXL, XLR8R, HHC, NME, and Exclaim!. It was also a hit with college radio (3 on CMJ hip-hop charts).\nGiant Panda made URB's list of Next 100 in 2005. This buzz allowed the group to tour the West Coast with fellow Angelino hip-hoppers People Under The Stairs and Time Machine. In 2006 GP hit the road with Ugly Duckling for a European tour, and then once again that year reached the EU shores with People Under The Stairs. 20 May 2008 saw the release of Giant Panda's sophomore effort, Electric Laser. XLR8R called Electric Laser \"futuristic funk\" that stays true to the group's \"boom bap\" and \"electro\" modes but also moves the sound forward. \nThe group cites De La Soul, Jungle Brothers, EPMD and A Tribe Called Quest as key influences.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Promos ===\nFresh Donuts (2002)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nFly School Reunion (2005)\nElectric Laser (2008)\n\n\n=== 7\" singles ===\nJust Cause (2001)\n\n\n=== 12\" singles ===\n'88 Remix (2002)\nWith It (2005)\nSuper Fly (2005)\nT.K.O.

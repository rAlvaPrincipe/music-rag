    "text": "The Calder Quartet (CQ) is a string quartet based in Los Angeles, California.  Founded in 1998 at the University of Southern California, the group takes its name from American sculptor Alexander Calder. The ensemble is currently composed of its founding members, including violinists Benjamin Jacobson and Tereza Stanislav, violist Jonathan Moerschel, and cellist Eric Byers. Los Angeles Times music critic, Mark Swed called the CQ \"one of America's great string quartets.\" In 2014, the CQ was awarded one of Lincoln Center's prestigious Avery Fisher Career Grants for \"professional assistance and recognition to talented instrumentalists who the Recommendation Board and Executive Committee believe have great potential.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Calder Quartet formed at the University of Southern California’s Thornton School of Music and continued studies at the Colburn School with Ronald Leonard, where they were part of that school's first graduating class.

The CPAO funded the recording of Eclectic Currents, a 2014 album featuring 12 emerging composers who have written for the Calder Quartet. The CPAO has commissioned works with partners including the Getty Center and the Barbican Centre.\n\n\n== Commissions, premieres, and appearances ==\nThe Calder Quartet has commissioned or premiered more than 30 works from established and emerging composers, including Terry Riley, Thomas Adès, Christopher Rouse, Peter Eötvös, Andrew Norman, David Lang (upcoming, June 2014 with Los Angeles Master Chorale), Mark Mothersbaugh, and Aaron Jay Kernis.

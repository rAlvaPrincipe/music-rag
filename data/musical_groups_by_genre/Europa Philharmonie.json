The orchestra's debut took place in 1996 with live television coverage across Europe with 3sat, performing Gustav Mahler's \"Resurrection\" in St. Peters's Church, Görlitz under the direction of principal conductor Reinhard Seehafer, with cooperation from the foundation Kreisau/Krzyzowa.\nEuropa Philharmonie stands for a tolerant and unified Europe, which is a view also reflected in the patronage of the German and Polish state presidents, and the president of the German Federal Parliament, as well as the work of the board of trustees \"Indivisible Europe\" of which Professor Kurt Masur, the late Lea Rabin, Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Prof.\nDr. Dieter Stolte are members.\nFrom 1998 to 2007, the orchestra was based in Schloss Hundisburg (Hundisburg Castle) in Saxony-Anhalt, which is one of the most important baroque castles in northern Germany.\n\n\n== Worldwide Concert Activity ==\nIn honour of the 30th anniversary of the diplomatic relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the People's Republic of China in 2002, Europa Philharmonie gave guest performances in Shanghai, Beijing and five other cities in China.\nIn 2004, the orchestra was the first classical symphony orchestra in the world to perform in Sana'a, the capital city of Yemen, at the opening concert for \"Sana'a - Cultural Capital of the Arab World\", which was attended by its patron, the former President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Thierse, and the Yemen Minister for Culture and Tourism, Khalid Al-Rewaishan.

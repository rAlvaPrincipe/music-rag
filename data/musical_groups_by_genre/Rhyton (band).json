    "text": "Rhyton is an American experimental psychedelic rock band from Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\n== History ==\nRhyton was formed as an improvisational outfit by Dave Shuford, Jimy Seitang, and Spencer Herbst; Shuford had been a member of No Neck Blues Band and Seitang had played with Psychic Ills. The group recorded its debut album in a span of only three days, later issuing it as a self-titled effort on the label Thrill Jockey. Drummer Rob Smith, who was also a member of Pigeons, began touring with the band across the US and Europe, and subsequently replaced Herbst when he left. Rhyton began incorporating more Greek and Southern-American song forms with their improvisations, and has since released two further full-lengths on Thrill Jockey as well as two limited-edition LPs on other labels.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nRhyton (Thrill Jockey, 2011)\nThe Emerald Tablet (Three Lobed Recordings, 2012)\nKykeon (Thrill Jockey, 2014)\nNavigating by Starlight (MIE Music, 2015)\nRedshift (Thrill Jockey, 2016)\n\n\n== References =="

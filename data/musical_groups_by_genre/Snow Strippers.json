    "text": "Snow Strippers are an American electronic music duo formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 2021. They first gained prominence online as part of the indie sleaze resurgence in 2021 before self-releasing their eponymous debut album in 2022 and the mixtapes April Mixtape 2 and April Mixtape 3 in 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\n== History ==\nTatiana Schwaninger was born and raised in Clearwater, Florida, where she met record producer Graham Perez in 2018. The two became close after meeting on Tinder in 2018 and soon moved to Detroit together before relocating to New York City.\nThe two started making music as Snow Strippers in late 2021, with Schwaninger singing and Perez producing. Prior to the duo's formation, Schwaninger had not made any music. They released music under their own label, Nice Bass Bro, including their 2022 self-titled debut album and their 2022 mixtape April Mixtape 2, until signing to Surf Gang Records in 2023. Their first record to be released through the latter label was their third mixtape, April Mixtape 3, in May 2023, which was preceded by the singles \"Under Your Spell\" and \"Don't You Feel\". They were featured on American rapper Lil Uzi Vert's album Pink Tape in June 2023. They released the extended play Night Killaz Vol. 1 on November 24, 2023, through Surf Gang Records, preceded by the single \"Just Your Doll\". The duo's following album, Night Killaz, Vol. 2, was released May 8, 2024.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nSnow Strippers' music has primarily been described as electronic music; they have described it as EDM and it has also been described as electropop. It contains elements of new rave, witch house, electroclash, shoegaze, hyperpop, and techno, and has frequently been compared to the music of Canadian electronic duo Crystal Castles. Clash's Robin Murray compared their \"digitised sound with a punk-like rawness to it\" to the American electronic band Salem. Pigeons and Planes' Sophie Walker wrote that their music was \"trashy and decidedly off like a Harmony Korine film\". Matt Weinberger of Paper described the duo's music as having \"an electronic, icy eargasm sound\", while The Line of Best Fit's Mitch Stevens wrote that their music was \"electronic chaos\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Hofer Symphoniker (Hof Symphony Orchestra) is a German symphony orchestra based in Hof, Bavaria, Germany. The orchestra began its performing activity in 1945, when Kapellmeister Karl F. Keller founded it as Hofer Konzertorchester.\nAs a concert orchestra, Hofer Symphoniker gives concerts at Freiheitshalle Hof, an event building and concert hall, as well as at several locations in the region of Upper Franconia. The orchestra worked together with artists like Elīna Garanča, Mojca Erdmann, Julia Fischer, Hilary Hahn, Daniel Hope, Albrecht Mayer, Daniel Müller-Schott, Martin Stadtfeld and Jörg Widmann. The orchestra also performs regularly at Thurn und Taxis Castle Festival in Regensburg with singers like José Carreras, Lucia Aliberti and Jonas Kaufmann.\nAs a theatre orchestra, Hofer Symphoniker performs at Theater Hof which was newly built in 1994. It is the orchestra's home venue where it plays operas, operettas, musicals and ballets. The theatre also serves as a multi-purpose venue for drama productions and other performances.\nIn 1978, Hofer Symphoniker opened its own music school, used to train future talents. As such, the Hofer Symphoniker Music School is the only music school in Germany that is attached to a professional symphony orchestra. As a cultural and educational centre, the corporation includes also a Suzuki Academy and an Art School. An important award was the prestigious Echo Klassik Special Prize for youth education in 2010.\nSince 2007, the International Violin Competition Henri Marteau, named after the famous violinist and violin teacher Henri Marteau, takes place under the sponsorship of the District of Upper Franconia and is being organized by Hofer Symphoniker every three years in Lichtenberg and Hof.\n\n\n== Conductors ==\nChief conductors of Hofer Symphoniker were:\n\n1945–1950: Karl F.

    "text": "Abortive Gasp was an electro-industrial band formed by lead singer Tim Paal and composer Harry Luehr in 1988 in Hamburg, Germany. The two were often supported by various guest musicians.\n\n\n== History ==\nWithin the electronic body music and independent music scenes, the duo was characterized by a high degree of improvisation as well as the early use of dub. Their apolitical stance made them controversial.\nThe reviews of Abortive Gasp by different music journalists, such as Brian Duguid, were rather positive. Some of their well-known songs like \"Church is Empty\" and \"Psychgod\" received good airplay on particular broadcast stations in the United States, Belgium, and Australia.\nIn their final phase, the band drew attention by playing as support for Borghesia, to whose aesthetics they were in strong contrast. The band broke up in December 1989. They were the subject of a short documentary in 2021.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nTo Have The Second Crack (1988) self-distributed tape\nRaw Scent (1989) self-distributed tape\nBullfrog (1989) Alternate Media Tapes\nA Fridge Fulla Bribes (1989) Harsh Reality Music\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscogs"

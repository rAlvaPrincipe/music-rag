    "text": "Valley is a Canadian indie pop band based in Toronto.\nThe band members are lead vocalist Rob Laska, bassist Alex Dimauro, and drummer Karah James. They received a Juno Award nomination for Breakthrough Group of the Year at the 2020 Juno Awards as well as a nomination for Group of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2022. On March 15, 2024, Brandolino announced that he was parting ways with the band due to wanting to pursue music production full-time.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band formed in 2014 after the members of two other bands accidentally got double-booked for the same time slot at a local recording studio. Other names considered were Thieves, The Engineers, and Grouphug. They released their debut EP, Car Test, in 2015, and followed up with This Room Is White in 2016. In 2018 they released Maybe Side A, the first of two EPs featuring tracks planned for their full-length debut album; the second EP, Maybe Side B, followed in spring 2019, and the full album Maybe was released in September.\nValley released their single \"Nevermind\" in July 2020, which was then followed by \"Hiccup\" in September. On October 15, Valley announced the release of their EP, Sucks to See You Doing Better, which featured both \"Nevermind\" and \"Hiccup\", as well as four new tracks, including an acoustic version of \"Hiccup\".\nIn February 2021, Valley released their single \"Like 1999\" and announced they would tour with Coin in over 30 cities across North America, beginning in October.\nMidway through 2021, they released the single \"Society\", which the band says came from their previous experiences of balancing an accessible narrative with their artistic pursuits. On July 23, 2021, they released the single \"Tempo\".\nThe single \"Homebody\" was a nominee for the 2021 SOCAN Songwriting Prize. \"Oh Shit...Are We in Love?\" was released on September 1, 2021.\nThe band released Water the Flowers, Pray for a Garden on August 30, 2024, their first album as a trio.\nTheir fans are lovingly called Val Pals which the band has embraced in their email and instagram content. Val Pals meet up regularly when the band is on tour to show their loyalty and support.\n\n\n== Members ==\nList of members and roles.\n\nRob Laska – Lead vocals, guitar (2014–present)\nAlex Dimauro – Bass, keyboard, backing vocals (2014–present)\nKarah James – Drums, backing and lead vocals (2014–present)\nFormer members\n\nBen Lee – Keyboards, backing vocals (2014-2016)\nMichael \"Mickey\" Brandolino – Guitar, drums, keyboard, piano, backing vocals (2014-2024)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== Juno Awards ===\nThe Juno Awards, more popularly known as the JUNOS, are awards presented annually to Canadian musical artists and bands to acknowledge their artistic and technical achievements in all aspects of music.\n\n\n=== SOCAN Songwriting Prize ===\nThe SOCAN Songwriting Prize, formerly known as the ECHO Songwriting Prize, is an annual competition recognizing the best in Canadian emerging music, both anglophone and francophone.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

To reflect the group's name and concept, the members performed with wireless microphones attached to their pinky rings. With the lineup consisting of Kana Sakura, Riko Kayama, and Keekihime Yumi, Tone Jewel was marketed as a trio of \"hardcore otaku\" high school girls and built a fanbase on Niconico. Keekihime, an Austrian native, had been recruited through an online audition held by Victor Entertainment and prior to joining, she was a vlogger on Niconico. The group first recorded music independently for a Touhou Project fan project. Their first extended play, Sistars Trip, was sold exclusively at Comiket 82 on August 11, 2012, with the cover artwork drawn by Keekihime. Tone Jewel made their major label debut on August 22, 2012 with the extended play Kimiiro Note, featuring \"Kimiiro Inryoku\" as the promotional track. After the release of the song, Kayama departed from the group. In a 2023 Instagram post, Keekihime states that, after this, Tone Jewel was dropped from Victor Entertainment and they performed as an independent group.\nOn December 30, 2012, Tone Jewel released their first studio album, Meguru Kiseki, independently and sold it exclusively at Comiket 83, with the album illustration provided by Keekihime. Sana Takimura was later recruited as a second generation member. In 2013, Tone Jewel released their debut single, \"Blooming Song\", which was produced by Arte Refact.\nAt the end of 2013, Sakura left the group due to family reasons. Later that year, Keekihime and Takimura also departed from the group due to Keekihime's visa issues, which had limited her performances.\n\n\n=== 2014–present: Line-up and name changes ===\nMiyabi Hazuki, Momoka Miyashita, and Chihiro Ayase, three girls who had previously been recruited into the group as research students (trainees), began performing under the name Tone Jewel Research Students under independent labels. After several member line-up changes, Tone Jewel was renamed and also established sister groups, such as End of Silence, Twist Jewel, and Tradition Jack.\nOn March 22, 2024, Chihiro announced that she was retiring from the group.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nKana Machimura (町村かな)\nHinano Takayama (高山緋奈乃)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nChihiro Ayase (彩瀬千聖) (2014-2024)\nRiko Kayama (嘉山璃子) (2012-2013)\nKana Sakura (沙倉香奈) (2012-2014)\nKeekihime Yumi (ケーキ姫☆優海) (2012-2014)\nSana Takimura (瀧村咲菜) (2013-2014)\nMiyabi Hazuki (菜月雅美)\nMomoka Miyashita (宮下桃歌)\nMoeka Morimoto (森元萌香)\nAyane Yokoniwa (横庭綾音)\nYūki Itonaga (糸永有希)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n==== Major ====\n\n\n==== Indie ====\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial website (2012-2014)"

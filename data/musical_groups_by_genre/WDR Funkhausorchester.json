    "text": "The WDR Funkhausorchester is a German broadcast orchestra of the Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR, West German Broadcasting) in Cologne. The orchestra gives its concerts in such venues as the Kölner Philharmonie and in the Funkhaus Wallrafplatz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nGroups from which the orchestra was formed date back to 1927. In its present form, the orchestra was founded in 1947, with Hermann Hagestedt as its first chief conductor. The orchestra has been known previously as the Kölner Rundfunkorchester.\nThe orchestra's repertoire includes a full range of popular music, musicals, opera and operetta, film and classical music, including lesser-known oratorio and \"easy listening\" music. For several years, the orchestra has worked with younger conductors such as Titus Engel and Rasmus Baumann.\nThe orchestra's most recent chief conductor was Wayne Marshall, who held the post from 2014 through 2020. The orchestra's current principal guest conductor is Enrico Delamboye. In November 2020, the orchestra announced the appointment of Frank Strobel as its next chief conductor, effective in the autumn of 2021.\n\n\n== Chief conductors ==\nHermann Hagestedt (1947–1968)\nFranz Marszalek (1949–1965)\nCurt Cremer (1968–1989)\nHeinz Geese (1968–1995)\nHelmuth Froschauer (1997–2006)\nMichail Jurowski (2006–2008)\nNiklas Willén (2010–2013)\nWayne Marshall (2014–2020)\nFrank Strobel (2021–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\nStudio for Electronic Music (WDR)\nWDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne (WDR Sinfonieorchester Köln)\nWDR Big Band\nWDR Rundfunkchor Köln\nRadio orchestra\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to WDR Funkhausorchester Köln at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website"

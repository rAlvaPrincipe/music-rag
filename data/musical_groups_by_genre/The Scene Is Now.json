    "text": "The Scene is Now is a New York City-based avant-garde no wave jug band from the 1980s.\nIts founding members were Dick Champ, Philip Dray, Jeff McGovern (also of Mofungo), and Chris Nelson. Influences included the Holy Modal Rounders, The Fugs, the no wave noise music bands DNA and Mars, and the traditional Americana of Bob Wills and Hoagy Carmichael.\nTheir songs, most of which are compiled on the album The Oily Years, tend to be somewhat rough, lo-fi recordings. Their song Yellow Sarong was later covered by Yo La Tengo for the 1990 album Fakebook.\nThurston Moore called the band's sound \"drunken sailor music\" as a compliment.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBurn All Your Records (Lost, 1985)\nTotal Jive (Lost, 1986)\nTonight We Ride (Lost, 1988)\nShotgun Wedding (Lost, 1991; released only on cassette due to a lack of funds)\nThe Oily Years (Bar/None, 1995)\nSongbirds Lie (Tongue Master, 2004)\nMagpie Alarm (Tongue Master, 2011)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The 22 Wing Band (French: La Fanfare de la 22e Escadre) is a military band of the Royal Canadian Air Force. The band is currently based at CFB North Bay in Ontario. It was formed between 1989 and 1990 primarily to support ceremonial functions at the base. Its founder, then-Warrant Officer Chip Kean recruited 25 local civilian musicians to join the newly sanctioned band which designated Kean as its first official bandmaster. Kean retired in 1995, however, returned in 1998 as part of the Air Reserve due to the danger of the band being disbanded by the Department of National Defence.\nToday, it takes part and focuses its attention toward other events such as public concerts and charities. The company-sized band consists of 60â€“65 musicians who, make up the parade and concert band, as well as a Jazz and brass quartet. The current band director is Sergeant Scott Barons. With the exception of the Band Director and Assistant Director, are volunteer musicians, both military and civilian.\n\n\n== Notable events ==\nSalute To Military Families at the Annual Children's Festival in the Capitol Centre in North Bay\nSalute to Policing Tattoo\nCanada 150 celebrations in North Bay, Ontario\n50th Anniversary of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)\nChange of Command at CFB North Bay\nRemembrance Day celebrations\n\n\n== See also ==\nCanadian military bands\nRoyal Canadian Air Force\nRoyal Canadian Air Force Band\nRoyal Air Force March Past\n\n\n== References =="

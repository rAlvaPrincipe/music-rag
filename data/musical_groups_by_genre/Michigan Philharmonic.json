    "text": "The Michigan Philharmonic (or “Michigan Phil”) is a professional symphony orchestra in Southeast Michigan. The Michigan Phil has grown from a small community orchestra to an award-winning, dynamic and innovative professional regional orchestra serving several Michigan communities, including Plymouth, Canton, Birmingham-Bloomfield, Grosse Pointe, Detroit. Nan Washburn has served as Music Director and Conductor since 1999.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Michigan Philharmonic was established as the Plymouth Symphony in 1945 by local residents Evelyn and Carl Groschke and Paul Wagner, director of the Plymouth High School music program, who were looking to organize a community orchestra. The orchestra began performing in the gym at Plymouth High School and then at Plymouth Colony Farms in the 1950s and before settling at the Plymouth-Salem High School Auditorium where they performed for many years.\nIn 1998, the orchestra began to shift from the role of a community band to a professional regional orchestra performing more progressive, innovative works with a wider geographic outreach within the Southeast Michigan area. This shift was solidified by the hiring of southern California conductor Nan Washburn after an extensive nationwide search.\nNow, with 19 ASCAP awards for adventuresome programming, Nan Washburn also introduced her new and unique programming ideas as well as her dedication to music education.  The orchestra naturally began to attract new and better players, because of the opportunity to play more challenging repertoire, as well as an interest in performing contemporary classical works by living composers.  To serve the orchestra’s educational goals, a program was created in 1998 to bring classical music to 3rd and 4th graders.  Under the guidance of Nan Washburn, the program was revised and improved in 2001 and given the name CLASSical Music Outreach. in 2003 Nan Washburn founded the Michigan Philharmonic Youth Orchestra which she served as Art Director and Conductor of until 2017.\nMichigan Philharmonic is dedicated to sharing the music of living composers in order to keep classical music alive and relevant. Every classical concert features music by a contemporary composer.\nLiving composers whose work has been featured by Michigan Philharmonic:\n\nLowell Liebermann: Flute Concerto\nAndre Myers: Changes, Apex of R\nMichael Gilbertson\nMiguel del Águila: The Giant Guitar, Concierto con Brio\nLibby Larsen: Concerto for Saxophone\nEvan Chambers: Watershed\nChen Yi: The Golden Flute\nPeter Taussig: Concerto for Bagpipe and Orchestra\nMichael Daugherty: Ladder to the Moon\nLee Actor:\nAlice Gomez: Los Voladros\nVictoria Bond: Bridges\nRick Robinson: Pork 'n Beans\nNancy Bloomer Deussen\nCarter Pann: Slalom\nFrank Ticheli: Blue Shades for Orchestra\nKareem Roustom: Hewar (Dialogue) for Takht & Orchestra\nJesse Ayers:  The Passion of John Brown\nClarice Assad: The Last Song\nChristopher Cerrone: Recovering\nMax Simoncic\nLaura Karpman: Suite from \"Taken\"\nKatherine Hoover: Four Winds Flute Concerto\nJim Beloff: Uke Can't Be Serious\nJudith Shatin: Spin\nMary Watkins: The Initiate\nZhou Tian A Thousand Years of Good Prayers\nRicardo Lorenz\nWael Binali: Earth, Plunder, Wound, Renewal, Hope\nWhitney George: Quoth The Raven\nDavid Biedenbender: Their Eyes Are Fireflies\nKristin Kuster\nBrad Phillips: Unfolding\nMimi Fox: The 39th Parallel\nJan Bach: Concerto for Steelpan and Orchestra\nDianne Hartman: My Child Suite\nJimmy López: Bellido Avec Swing for Chamber Ensemble\nDai Wei: Invisible Portals\nJessica Hunt: The Eagle Tree\nErik Santos: PAN for Oboe and Orchestra\n\n\n== Conductors ==\nNan Washburn (1999–present)\nRussell Reed (1987–1999)\nLeon Gregorian (1986–1987)\nCharles Greenwell (1985–1986)\nJohan van der Merwe (1980–1985)\nWayne Dunlap (1951–1979)\nPaul Wagner (1945–1950)\n\n\n== Awards ==\nErnst Bacon Memorial Award in the Performance of American Music, 2016 – Professional Division.\nDetroit Music Award for Outstanding Community Orchestra – 2018 \n\n\n== External links ==\nMichigan Philharmonic\n\n\n== References =="

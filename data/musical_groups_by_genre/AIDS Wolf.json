    "text": "AIDS Wolf was a Canadian noise rock band, founded in Montreal in 2003, by the graphic arts team of Chloe Lum (aka Special Deluxe) and Yannick Desranleau (aka Hiroshima Thunder), otherwise known as Seripop. They were joined by Myles Broscoe (late of Arcade Fire), Chris Taylor (aka Barbarian Destroyer), Nick Kuepfer, André Guérette (aka Him, the Maji), and Alex Moskos. The band was known for playing modified consumer electronics and analog synthesizers, for giving creative names to instruments, and for being “weird for the sake of being weird.” On their label's band page, they stated \"We are a fucking cult and will cause you harm and ill will,\" then added \"The 9 Principles of AIDS Wolf\".\n\n\n== Name ==\nAccording to Chloe Lum, the name \"AIDS Wolf\" came from an urban legend wherein wolves carry AIDS and pass it to house pets who then pass it on to people, although she did not offer evidence of this legend. At another time, Lum stated \"My partner and I were on a road trip in Ohio, and it just came to us. It was a universal message. It's a combination of our spirit peers in An Albatross (animal) and The Sick Lipstick (R.I.P.) (illness). It fits, because we're a little bit no–wave and a little bit hardcore, like each of those bands. It's also a message that we as humans must take care for our animal siblings as their health is a barometer of our own survival.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band co-produced the EP, Live Deth (2005), with the American label Kitty Play Records. It then produced a two-song cassette called Freedom Summer, which was released by Pasalymany Tapes. That same year, the label Blood of the Drash released their four-track EP The Fugue. The band then went on tour through Canada and the US, with their reputation for performing in a \"completely out of hand\" fashion preceding their arrival in each city.\nIn 2005, the band signed with Skin Graft Records and, in 2006, released the album The Lovvers LP, which received generally fair reviews,\nas did 2008's Cities of Glass. One critic cited Cities of Glass as being \"violent, dirty, and really good.\"\nThe praise continued with the band's 2010 album, March to the Sea. Two albums released in 2011--Ma vie banale avant-garde and Live: An Insane and Abstract Hell (Dedicated To Two Dudes From Rusted Shut), got little notice. In between albums, there were several EPS, and split releases with a variety of bands.\nThe band tended to tour the US only in promotion of its albums although, to promote Ma vie banale avant-garde, the band staged Nocturne, a show with 3D projections (glasses supplied) at the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal. It then went on a month-long tour of the US.\nIn March 2012, the band—now down to the trio of Desranleau, Lum and Moskos, announced that it had broken up due to time constraints.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nThe Lovvers LP (2006), Skin Graft Records (vinyl format) & Lovepump United Records (cd format)\nCities of Glass (2008), Skin Graft Records (cd), Lovepump United Records (vinyl)\nMarch to the Sea (2010), Skin Graft Records\nMa vie banale avant-garde (2011), Lovepump United Records\nAn Insane and Abstract Hell (Dedicated To Two Dudes From Rusted Shut) (2011), Zum Records\nSplits\n\nAIDS Wolf/Dmonstrations/Pre/Crack und Ultra Eczema (2006), Lovepump United Records\nClash of the Life-Force Warriors, AIDS Wolf vs. Athletic Automaton (2007), Skin Graft Records\nLive Dates (2007), with Pre, Skin Graft Records\nPluck Out Glass Eyes (2008), with Night Wounds, Nail In The Coffin Records\nAIDS Wolf/Satanized (2010), with Satanized, Badmaster Records & Suicide Tax Records\nEPs\n\nLive Deth (2005), Kitty Play Records\nThe Fugue (2005), Blood of the Drash Records\nChipped Teeth (2008), SlowBoy Records\nPas Rapport (2009), Independent\nDustin' Off The Sphynx (2009), Skin Graft Records\nVery Friendly remix (2010), Lovepump United Records\nSoaked in Oil (2011), We Are Busy Bodies\nSingles\n\n\"Freedom Summer\" (2005), Pasalymany Tapes\n\"Can-D\" / \"Chew-Z\" (2012), Deathbomb Arc\n\"Soaked in Oil / \"Foreign Hairs\" (2012), We Are Busy Bodies\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNoise music\nNoise rock\nExperimental rock\nMusic of Canada\nList of bands from Canada\nCanadian rock\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAIDS Wolf website\nSkingraft Records\nLovepump United Records\nInterview with AIDS Wolf on Jekyll and Hyde.

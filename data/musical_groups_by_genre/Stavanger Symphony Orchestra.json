The SSO principal venue is the Stavanger Concert Hall (Stavanger konserthus), performing in the Fartein Valen concert hall.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation founded the orchestra in 1938 as the Stavanger musikerforenings orkester, for radio broadcasts.  The orchestra's first artistic leader was the violinist Gunnar Knudsen, from 1938 to 1945.  In 1965, the orchestra's name was changed to the Symfoniorkestret i Stavanger, and again in 1982 to its present name.\nPast artistic leaders of the orchestra have included Susanna Mälkki (2002–2005), and more recently the American conductor Steven Sloane (2007–2013).  Christian Vásquez was chief conductor from 2013 to 2019.  In addition to its chief conductor, the SSO has appointed conductors with a formal principal responsibility for early music programming, including Frans Brüggen (1990–1997), Philippe Herreweghe, and since 2006, Fabio Biondi.  \nIn June 2019, the SSO announced the appointment of Andris Poga as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2021–2022 season.  Tianyi Lu became the SSO's conductor-in-residence for the 2021-2022 season.  In June 2023, the SSO announced an extension of Poga's contract as chief conductor through the 2025-2026 season.\nThe SSO has recorded commercially for such labels as BIS, including music of Harald Sæverud, Geirr Tveitt and Fartein Valen.\n\n\n== Artistic leaders and chief conductors ==\nGunnar Knudsen (1938–1945)\nKarsten Andersen (1945–1963)\nBjørn Woll (1963–1989)\nAleksandr Dmitriev (1990–1998)\nOle Kristian Ruud (1999–2002)\nSusanna Mälkki (2002–2005)\nSteven Sloane (2007–2013)\nChristian Vásquez (2013–2019)\nAndris Poga (2021–present)\n\n\n== Early music programme directors ==\nFrans Brüggen (1990–1997)\nPhilippe Herreweghe\nFabio Biondi (2006–2017)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial orchestra site\nStore Norske leksikon entry on the orchestra\nMusic Web International review of BIS CD-1162, Harald Sæverud, Symphony No. 5 and other works, 5 July 2005.\nMusic Web International review of BIS CD-1632, \"Fartein Valen: Orchestral Music, Volume 2\", 9 April 2009."

    "text": "Earth, Wind & Fire (abbreviated as EW&F or EWF) is an American band formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1969. Their music spans multiple genres, including jazz, R&B, soul, funk, disco, pop, Latin and Afro-pop. They are among the best-selling bands of all time, with sales of over 90 million records worldwide.\nThe band was formed by Maurice White, originating out of the Salty Peppers; its history includes a hiatus from mid-1984 to mid-1987. Prominent members have included Verdine White, Philip Bailey, Ralph Johnson, Larry Dunn, Al McKay, Roland Bautista, Robert Brookins, Sonny Emory, Freddie Ravel, Ronnie Laws, Sheldon Reynolds and Andrew Woolfolk. The band is known for its kalimba sound, dynamic horn section, energetic and elaborate stage shows, and the contrast between Bailey's falsetto and Maurice's tenor vocals.\nThe band has won six Grammy Awards out of 17 nominations and four American Music Awards out of 12 nominations. They have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the NAACP Image Award Hall of Fame, and Hollywood's Rockwalk, and earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The band has also received an ASCAP Rhythm & Soul Heritage Award, a BET Lifetime Achievement Award, a Soul Train Legend Award, a NARAS Signature Governor's Award, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, the 2012 Congressional Horizon Award, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2019. Rolling Stone has called them \"innovative, precise yet sensual, calculated yet galvanizing\" and declared that the band \"changed the sound of black pop\". VH1 has described EWF as \"one of the greatest bands\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1969–1970: Beginnings ===\nIn 1969, Maurice White, a former session drummer for Chess Records and former member of the Ramsey Lewis Trio, joined two friends in Chicago, Wade Flemons and Don Whitehead, as a songwriting team. They wrote songs and commercials in the Chicago area. The three friends got a recording contract with Capitol Records. Calling themselves The Salty Peppers, they had a marginal hit single in the Midwest titled \"La La Time\".\nThe Salty Peppers' second single, \"Uh Huh Yeah\", did not fare as well. Maurice moved from Chicago to Los Angeles. He added singer Sherry Scott and percussionist Yackov Ben Israel, both from Chicago, to the band. He asked his younger brother Verdine to join and on June 6, 1970, Verdine moved from Chicago to LA to become the band's bassist. Maurice began shopping demo tapes featuring Donny Hathaway to various record labels and the band eventually signed to Warner Bros. Records.\n\n\n=== 1970–1974: Formation and early years ===\nMaurice White's astrological sign, Sagittarius, has a primary elemental quality of fire and seasonal qualities of earth and air, according to classical triplicities. Sagittarius in the northern hemisphere occurs in the autumn, whose element is earth, and in the southern hemisphere, it is spring, whose element is air. Hence the omission of water, the fourth classical element. Based on this, he changed the band's name, to Earth, Wind & Fire. White held further auditions in L.A, adding Michael Beal on guitar, Chester Washington on reeds, and Leslie Drayton on trumpet. White was a percussionist and lead vocalist. Drayton served as the group's arranger. Trombonist Alex Thomas completed the then ten-man lineup. Warner Bros. designated Joe Wissert to be the band's producer.\n\n\n==== Earth, Wind & Fire ====\nThe band's self-titled debut album was released in March 1971 on Warner Bros. The album got to No. 24 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and was certified Gold in France by the SNEP.\nLester Bangs of Rolling Stone noted a \"heavy Sly influence\" and the \"smooth harmonies\" of The Fifth Dimension on the LP. Bob Talbert of the Detroit Free Press also wrote \"I'm not sure what to call this group. Afro-gospel-jazz-blues-rock? Must there be a label?\".\n\n\n==== Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song ====\nEWF went on to supply the entire soundtrack of the Melvin Van Peebles feature film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. The soundtrack, composed by Van Peebles, was released in April 1971 on Stax Records. Ian McCann of udiscovermusic.com found \"Today, though, you couldn't find a record, soundtrack, or otherwise, as freewheelin' and funky as this.\" Jamie Atkins of Record Collector also found the soundtrack is \"Well worth checking out.\" The album reached No. 13 on the Billboard Top R&B Albums chart.\n\n\n==== The Need of Love ====\nIn November 1971, EWF's second album, titled The Need of Love, was issued. The LP got to No. 35 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart. Bruce Lindsay of Jazz Journal said \"as evidence of a tight, stylish, band in the early stages of its career this is a worthwhile album\". Al Rudis of The Chicago Sun-Times wrote \"Their second album, The Need of Love again displays some unusual music that might be called avant garde were it not so melodic and entrancing. The nine-member group mixes excellent jazzy instrumentals with harmony singing and chanting, some big band sounds and some free-form parts as well as solid soul beats. It all works beautifully, and while the elements of Earth, Wind and Fire aren't new, this mixture of them is a unique sound\".\nA single from the album called \"I Think About Lovin' You\" reached No. 44 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart.\nThe band became popular on college campuses, although some members started to become restless and the band eventually split. With only Verdine left, Maurice decided to re-form the group.\nDuring 1972, Maurice added vocalist Helena Davis, Ronnie Laws on the flute and saxophone, rhythm guitarist Roland Bautista, keyboardist Larry Dunn, vocalist Philip Bailey and percussionist Ralph Johnson. Davis was soon replaced by Jessica Cleaves, a former member of the R&B group The Friends of Distinction.\nThe band successfully auditioned for managers Bob Cavallo and Joe Ruffalo. Cavallo's management of John Sebastian led to a series of gigs as his opening act. A performance at New York's Rockefeller Center introduced EWF to Clive Davis, then-President of Columbia Records. Davis was impressed and bought their contract from Warner Bros. Wissert went along with the band.\n\n\n==== Last Days and Time ====\nTheir debut album on CBS/Columbia Records, Last Days and Time, was issued in October 1972. The album got to No. 15 on the US Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 9 on the UK Blues & Soul Top British Soul Albums chart. Paul Sexton of Record Mirror proclaimed \"Musical historians and EWF fans alike will welcome (Last Days and Time)\". Ovid Goode Jr. of The Los Angeles Daily News declared \"Last Days and Time, sprouts forth with a fresh sound that sets it apart from many of the ho-hum aggregations around today. The album consists of eight moving tunes\". Hip Hop artist Nas was also inspired by the album's cover art while British singer Gabrielle also named Last Days and Time as one of her favorites.\nA single called \"Mom\" got to No. 39 on the Cashbox Top R&B Singles chart.\nSoon thereafter, Roland Bautista and Ronnie Laws left. Denver native Philip Bailey recommended his former East High School classmate, saxophonist Andrew Woolfolk, as a replacement for Laws. Woolfolk had been busy in New York studying sax with sax maestro Joe Henderson and was due to start a career in banking at the time. To fill the void created by Bautista's departure, rhythm guitarists Al McKay and Johnny Graham were added. Graham previously played with New Birth, while McKay was a former member of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue and The Watts 103rd St. Rhythm Band.\n\n\n==== Head to the Sky ====\nEWF's fourth studio album, Head to the Sky, was released in May 1973. The album rose to No. 2 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 27 on the Billboard 200 chart. Head to the Sky was certified US Platinum by the RIAA.\nVince Aletti of Rolling Stone declared \"Been having a lot of music dreams lately but this one's not too surprising since I've been playing the Earth, Wind & Fire album pretty constantly for the past week, certainly beyond all expectations\".  Aletti also noted EWF \"sound like a cosmic choir and generate a Sly Stone effect\" on the album. Tony Palermo of the Pittsburgh Press wrote \"Folks like to compare this bunch with War, but the first difference that hits you with E,W&F's brand of jazz-rhythm and blues is the smoothness of Jessica Cleaves' vocal work. Then, the extra slug of R&B in their style\".\nA single off the LP titled \"Evil\" got to No. 19 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Songs and No. 25 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs charts respectively. Another single called\n\"Keep Your Head to the Sky\" rose to No. 23 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. Jessica Cleaves left after the album release.\n\n\n==== Open Our Eyes ====\nThe band's follow-up album was co-produced by Maurice and Wissert. This LP was recorded at James William Guercio's Caribou Ranch Studio and Open Our Eyes was released in March 1974. Ken Emerson of Rolling Stone called Open Our Eyes \"a pleasant miscellany of Africana, Latin rhythms, well-mannered funk, smooth jazz, Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder and the Fifth Dimension\". The Village Voice's Robert Christgau described the album as a complete \"tour de force\". The album rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 15 on the Billboard 200 chart. Open Our Eyes was certified US Platinum.\nA single from the LP called \"Mighty Mighty\" reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. \"Kalimba Story\" rose to No. 6 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. \"Devotion\" got to No. 23 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\nAfter Open Our Eyes was issued, Maurice's younger brother, Fred White, joined the band. He had previously played in Chicago clubs as a drummer with Donny Hathaway and Little Feat.\nOn April 6, 1974, EWF performed at the California Jam, a West Coast rock festival that attracted an audience of 200,000. The concert was televised in the US on May 10, 1974, by ABC.\n\n\n==== Another Time ====\nIn September 1974, a compilation double album titled Another Time, comprising songs from EWF's first two studio albums, was released by Warner Bros. The album got to No. 29 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart.\nThe band collaborated with Ramsey Lewis on his album Sun Goddess, which was produced by Maurice and issued in late 1974 by Columbia. The album got to No. 1 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 12 on the Billboard 200 chart. The LP's title track rose to No. 20 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart.\nSun Goddess was certified US Gold.\n\n\n=== 1975–1980: Ornate sound ===\n\n\n==== That's the Way of the World ====\nDuring 1975, EWF was approached by Sig Shore, producer of the motion picture Super Fly, to record the soundtrack to a new film titled That's the Way of the World. With a screenplay from Robert Lipsyte, the film was produced and directed by Shore. The film starred Harvey Keitel, Ed Nelson, EWF as \"The Group\" and Maurice as Early, \"The Group\"'s leader. Keitel played the role of a record producer who hears \"The Group\" performing and is wowed by their act.\nWhen the band saw the film they were convinced that it would become a box office bomb, which it eventually was. They therefore released the film's soundtrack before the film's premiere. The LP was produced by White and Charles Stepney and recorded at the Caribou Ranch Studio. Stepney had previously worked with artists such as the Dells, Terry Callier and Minnie Riperton and the Rotary Connection, of which Riperton was a member. Stepney's writing and production style included a more ornate, orchestral flourish, which influenced the soundtrack album.\nThat's the Way of the World was eventually issued in March 1975 by Columbia. The album rose to No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top Soul Albums charts. Stephen Curwood of The Boston Globe called the LP \"a sound you shouldn't miss.\" Daryl Easlea of the BBC described That's the Way of the World as a \"soul masterpiece\". The album was certified US triple platinum.\nFrom the LP came the single \"Shining Star\", which rose to No. 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Soul Singles charts. This made EWF the first black act to top both the Billboard album and singles charts. The song won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The album's second single was title track \"That's the Way of the World\". It reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot Soul Singles chart and No. 12 on the Hot 100 chart.\nWith the album's success the band was able to hire their own horn section, dubbed the Phenix Horns. They were composed of saxophonist Don Myrick, trombonist Louis Satterfield, and trumpeters Rahmlee Davis and Michael Harris. Myrick and Satterfield had both previously worked with White during his days as a session drummer at Chess Records.\n\n\n==== Gratitude ====\nAfter their first European tour, EWF returned to the studio in June 1975. The band eventually came away with an album of mostly live concert material together with some new tracks. As a double LP Gratitude was issued in November 1975. It rose to No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Soul Albums charts respectively. Kit Aiken of Uncut called Gratitude \"a kicking live album\". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune found \"an Ellingtonian fusion of styles on this live masterpiece.\" The album was certified US triple platinum.\nWith the LP came \"Sing a Song\", which rose to numbers 1 and 5 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs and Hot 100 charts, respectively. \"Can't Hide Love\" got to No. 11 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. \"Can't Hide Love\" was Grammy nominated for Best Arrangement For Voices. The album's title track was also nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\nDuring 1975, White established a production company called Kalimba Productions. He signed artists such as his former bandleader Ramsey Lewis; singer Deniece Williams, who had once been a member of Stevie Wonder's \"Wonderlove\" backup group; and girl group the Emotions. Maurice loaned the band's signature Phenix Horns and most of the other band members and put these and others Kalimba artists on tour with EWF.\nWhile co-producing and arranging EWF's follow-up LP, Williams's debut album, This Is Niecy, Ramsey Lewis's Salongo, and the Emotions' Flowers, their first album on Columbia Records, Charles Stepney died of a heart attack on May 17, 1976, in Chicago at the age of 45.\n\n\n==== Spirit ====\nWith Stepney's death, White went on to produce the band's new LP, Spirit, which was issued in October 1976. The album's title paid tribute to Stepney. The LP rose to No. 2 on both the Billboard Top Pop Albums and Top Soul Albums charts. Music Week commented \"With a more spiritual, ethereal feel than the six albums they had already cut to that point, it really marks a turning point in their career and is crammed with excellent tunes.\"John Abbey of Blues & Soul described Spirit as \"a mighty, mighty album\" which shows \"the power of the nine-piece Earth Wind & Fire conglomeration.\" Spirit was certified US double platinum.\n\"Getaway\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. The song also rose to No. 12 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Dance Club Play charts. \"Saturday Nite\" reached numbers 4 and 21 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs and Hot 100 charts, respectively. \"Saturday Nite\" rose to No. 12 on both the Billboard Dance Club Songs and UK Pop Singles charts, respectively. The track \"Earth, Wind and Fire\" was Grammy nominated for Best Instrumental Composition.\nDuring this period, EWF concerts became loaded with pyrotechnics, magic, laser lights, flying pyramids, levitating guitarists and elaborate production tricks that included the entire group ascending in a pyramid and a disappearing act. Stage magician Doug Henning appeared on many of their tours with his assistant and eventual successor, David Copperfield. George Faison began choreographing the shows.\n\n\n==== All 'n All ====\nIn November 1977, EWF released All 'n All, their eighth studio album. It was inspired by Maurice's month-long trip through Argentina and Brazil. The album rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart. John Rockwell of The New York Times declared \"All 'n All shows Maurice White and his cohorts pushing their music ever more in a febrile jazz‐rock direction.\" Monroe Anderson of the Chicago Tribune called the album as a \"rare blend of poetry, passion and artistic progression.\"\nAll 'n All won a Grammy for Best R&B Vocal Performance By A Duo, Group Or Chorus.

The film's soundtrack was also certified US platinum.\n\n\n==== The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol. 1 ====\nIn 1978, White established a subsidiary label of CBS titled The American Record Company (ARC). Soon afterwards he launched, alongside sound engineer George Massenburg, a new recording studio dubbed The Complex in West Los Angeles.

As a result, EWF's eleventh album, Raise!, was influenced by this new electronic sound and released in the Autumn of 1981. With this album rhythm guitarist Roland Bautista returned to EWF. Bautista went on to give the band's sound a bit of a hard rock feel with his playing. Raise! rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Top R&B Albums chart and No. 5 on the Billboard 200 chart.

With this album a uniquely distinct new wave and synth pop sound came into being. The album got to No. 8 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 40 on the Billboard 200 chart.\nMatty Karas of Rolling Stone opined \"Electric Universe marks Earth, Wind & Fire's leap into the 80s. Horns are out, keyboards and synthesizers are in, and the group's romantic jazz-oriented funk has been dropped in favor of more sensuous, and at times, rock oriented dance material\". Pam Lambert of The Wall Street Journal exclaimed \"After more than a decade together, Earth, Wind and Fire continue to chart new ground\". She added, \"In Maurice's otherwordly universe of synthesized sound, individual instruments like guitars and keyboards are drowned into the overall sonic mix. But, by way of compensation, this does focus attention on the group's trademark, their multitextured vocals.\"\nDon McLeese of the Chicago Sun Times also gave Electric Universe an honourable mention in his list of the top ten albums of 1983.\n\"Magnetic\" rose to No. 10 on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart and No. 36 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart.

Touch the World rose to No. 3 on the Billboard Top R&B Albums chart and No. 33 on the Billboard 200 chart. Touch the World was also certified US Gold.\nRoe Hoeburger of Rolling Stone found \"Bailey's falsetto sounds as pure and piercing as ever, but he often needs White's sly, low counterpunch to bring him back from the stratosphere.\" Pamela Bloom of High Fidelity proclaimed \"Touch the World is nothing if not contemporary (but)..the message, as always, is stop, step back, and turn up your light\". Touch the World was also nominated for a Soul Train Award in the category of Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year - Group, Band or Duo.\nSkylark penned \"System of Survival\" for the album.

    "text": "New Orleans Nightcrawlers are an American regional roots group, based in the New Orleans area. They were founded in 1994 by pianist Tom McDermott, sousaphonist Matt Perrine and trumpeter Kevin Clark.  In addition, original members of the band included trumpeter Barney Floyd, Frank Oxley, Mark Morris, and Peter Kaplan on percussion, Craig Klein and Rick Trolsen on trombones, and saxophonists Eric Traub, Ken \"Snakebite\" Jacobs and Jason Mingledorff and trumpeter Satoru Ohashi.  More recent members of the band have included saxophonist Brent Rose and drummer Tanio Hingle and Kerry “fatman” Hunter. Originally modeled on the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, the Crawlers brought something new to the New Orleans brass band scene with their sophisticated arrangements. Henry Butler, Evan Christopher, and Troy (Trombone Shorty) and Bruce Hornsby have performed/recorded with the group.   They have toured Japan, Brazil, several countries in Europe and much of America, and have released five albums. Their 2020 album, Atmosphere, won the Grammy Award for Best Regional Roots Music Album.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\n\n=== Grammy Awards ===\n\n\n=== OffBeat's Best of The Beat Awards ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\nNew Orleans Nightcrawlers (Rounder Records)\nFunknicity (Rounder Records)\nLive at the Old Point (Independent)\nSlither Slice (Threadhead Records)\nAtmosphere (Independent)\nToo Much To Hold (Independent)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAllMusic"

    "text": "Hello Seahorse! is a Mexican alternative rock band formed in 2005 in Mexico City. The band gained quick recognition as one of the leading acts in Mexican alternative and indie rock, placing their first commercial single \"Bestia\" on regular radio airplay by November 2008.\nEarly releases such as the EP Hoy a las Ocho featured lyrics in both English and Spanish, though later tracks are solely in the latter; these however deal about nonsense or surrealistic themes.\nThe band's second album Bestia was released on May 19, 2009. The track \"Bestia\" from that album won the \"song of the year\" award at Mexico's 2009 \"Indie-O Music Awards\" ceremony. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards Latinoamérica, they were nominated for and won the \"La Zona\" award. Also in 2009, they were nominated for best alternative song at the Latin Grammy Awards, but they lost to Calle 13, and the next year they were nominated in the same category with the song Criminal.\nHello Seahorse! has shared the stage with bands such as Beastie Boys, Jarvis Cocker, Clinic and The Killers.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nHello Seahorse's current line-up comprises a female vocalist/lyricist, and male keyboardist and drummer, with no guitarist.

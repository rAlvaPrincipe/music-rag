    "text": "L.A. Boyz was a Taiwanese pop/rap group composed of brothers Jeff Huang (黃立成, Huang Licheng) and Stanley Huang (黃立行, Huang Lixing), and their cousin Steven Lin (林智文) formed circa 1991. They are considered to be the first rap group in Taiwanese popular music. They released 13 albums (including 3 compilation albums) starting from their first \"SHIAM! 閃\" in 1992.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe trio were brought up in Irvine, California and met at its University High School. They first became involved in music through their interest in hip-hop dance moves learnt from parties around Orange County and Los Angeles, and fashion from Compton and South-Central LA. Their dancing, and entry into various competitions, eventually led them to be scouted by a representative of Pony Canyon Records, Taiwan.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Breakthrough ===\nL.A. Boyz received their \"big break ... with the demise of the Little Tigers, a cutesy group that ruled the Taiwan pop scene until one of their members got drafted.\" Their distinct sound and use of American slang propelled them to quick success, selling more than 130,000 copies of their first record Shiam. Their second album, released in the same year, was similarly received.\n\n\n=== Image and style ===\nThe L.A. Boyz style was a combination of the \"youthful, innocent\" look prevalent in Taiwanese pop at the time and a \"great stage gimmick\" in their dancing. They were perceived as an appealing hybrid of American and Taiwanese backgrounds. As Steven Lin noted in an interview with the LA Times in 1993, the perception Taiwanese youth had of Los Angeles as a symbol of modern America led them to choose their name (though only one of their members was from the city itself). Their music videos depict their unique style of synchronized breakdancing in clubs and concert halls and various urban environments. Shots of Kung-fu, Chinese New Year Dragons and baseball also feature.\n\n\n=== Musical style ===\nLA Boyz' music was influenced by a wide variety of pop and dance music. In their songs they make prominent references to new jack swing and Bobby Brown as well as techno and rap. A good example of their musical diversity is the song \"Ya!\", which features sampled breakbeats and vocals stings (such as \"yeah, uh-huh\", \"give me a big beat!\", \"drop the mid-range, drop the bass\"). It features transitions in tempo, a semitone key modulation, a Glissando synthesizer line, and a hip hop section. Their song \"I Like It\" is a reinterpretation of the disco band KC and the Sunshine Band song \"That's the Way (I Like It)\" in a hip hop style. Despite being known for their rapping, \"two-thirds of their music is actually a mixture of fast-paced dance-pop and slower, romantic R&B numbers.\" Their lyrical content include finance, their own rapping and dancing skills, American recording artists and genres (as mentioned above), American cartoons (e.g. The Hulk) and romantic love. Their lyrics reference and reflect to their hybrid nationality, an example from their song \"Jump\" – which was an eerily similar clone to Kriss Kross's hit song \"Jump\", imitating their beats, rhythms, and melodies. LA Boyz' song had a first verse – \"Jerry's gonna make his rap funky in Chinese/ First you gotta start off with the ABCs (American-born Chinese) / Then you gotta learn it like the Taiwanese\" – is followed closely by a reference to the American pop-cultural icon Superman. They also tone down the violent themes and difficult-to-understand slang in the lyrics for it to suit a Chinese-speaking audience. They also sought to identify their local Taiwanese audience (despite having audience in Korea, Japan and Mainland China) by speaking with a strong Taiwanese accent and re-releasing some songs in Hokkien.\n\n\n=== Break Up ===\nThe band's members all worked in film and production of other Taiwanese artists' albums. Despite their success garnering recognition in Singapore's Billboard Awards Best Performance Group category, Hong Kong Billboard Awards Best New Artist category and at Taiwan's own Golden Melody Awards the group eventually split. Jeff Huang returned to the United States and started an internet company that later merged with a Japanese software company in a 60 million dollar deal before once again returning to Taiwan and fronting hip-hop group Machi; brother Stanley went on to establish a successful solo career, winning Best Mandarin Male Singer in the 2005 Golden Melody Awards; and Lin currently works as an orthopedic surgeon in California while still participating in music and film.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJeffrey Huang\n\nChinese Name: 黃立成, Huang Licheng\n (1972-11-07) 7 November 1972Huwei Township, Taiwan\nOccupation: Vocalist for Machi\nMachi Website\nStanley Huang\n\nChinese Name: 黃立行, Huang Lixing\n (1975-09-21) 21 September 1975Taipei, Taiwan\nOccupation: Solo artist\nSteven Lin\n\nChinese Name: 林智文, Lin Ziwun\n (1976-04-15) 15 April 1976Los Angeles, California, United States\nOccupation: Resident doctor & actor\nSteven Lin Artist Webpage\nSteven Lin blog\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n==== SHIAM! 閃 ====\nLabel: Pony Canyon Records (Taiwan)\nProducer: Wang Chi-ping\nTrack Listing:\n1.閃 Go Posse\n2.愛我好嗎 Won't You Be My Girl? \n3.別客氣 Don't Say You're ⽍歹勢 (Taiwanese) \n4.來電吧 Dial My Number\n5.怎可能 Unbelievable\n6.好兄弟 Buddy Buddy \n7.緣投困仔 Lover's Boy (Taiwanese) \n8.飛越地平線 Drive & Fly\n9.夜魔 Devil's Candy\n10.夏天 Summer Vacation\n\n\n==== Jump 跳 ====\nLabel: Pony Canyon Records (Taiwan)\nProducer: Wang Chi-ping\nTrack Listing:\n1.跳 Jump\n2.季節的歌 Merry Christmas\n3.東方不賴 Oriental Mystery\n4.愛難纏 Love Is A Weird Thing \n5.神魂顛倒 Head Over Heels \n6.心碎洛城 LA Heartbreak \n7.落雨的晚上 Raining Night\n8.城市之間 Between Two Cities \n9.妳說妳會想我 Say You Gonna Miss Me \n10.最後一⽀支慢舞 The Last Dance \n11.閃(Remix) Go Posse (Remix)\n\n\n==== Ya!/야! ====\nLabel: Pony Canyon Records (Taiwan)\nProducer: Wang Chi-ping\nTrack Listing:\n1.Baseball, O-Lay!!

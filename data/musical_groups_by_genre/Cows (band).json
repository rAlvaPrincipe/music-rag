    "text": "Cows were a noise rock band from Minneapolis, Minnesota who formed in 1986 and disbanded in 1998. The band’s music mixed punk rock with surreal humour and copious amounts of noise played through distorted amplifiers and trumpet bleats, codifying them as a noise rock band. Throughout their career Cows released nine studio albums, all but one on the Minneapolis-based label Amphetamine Reptile Records. A star in honor of the Cows is on the outside mural of First Avenue. \n\n\n== History ==\nCows formed in 1986 with Kevin Rutmanis on bass, Thor Eisentrager on guitar, then front man Norm Rogers on vocals, and on drums Kevin's younger brother Sandris Rutmanis. Norm Rogers left the band in January 1987 to dedicate his time to drumming for the Jayhawks, later returning to play drums for Cows in 1990. Shannon Selberg become Cows’ front man in February 1987, providing both vocal and bugle duties. Sandris left the band in January 1998 and Cows disbanded thereafter.\n\nAfter disbanding, Shannon Selberg went on to front The Heroine Sheiks.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nCows were notorious for their raucous live performances. Acts the band have performed onstage include kicking people in the front row, spitting on the stage, throwing the microphone stand into the crowd, throwing food at the crowd, and drawing on themselves, among others. Lead singer Shannon Selberg's trademark is that he has a tattoo illustrating the game Hangman on his body that reads \"F_CK\" and another tattoo of an anchor with the word \"DAD\" on top of it. One reviewer wrote about the band's shows, \"I have no doubt that the Cows know how to play their instruments. What I don't understand is why they refuse to tune them.\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nCows have been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nShannon Selberg – Vocals, Bugle, Trumpet, Trombone (1987–1998)\nKevin Rutmanis – Bass (1987–1998)\nThor Eisentrager – Guitar (1987–1998)\nDavid van der Steen – Fifth Udder (1987–1992)\nSandris Rutmanis – Drums (1987–1988)\nTony Oliveri – Drums (1988–1990)\nNorm Rogers – Drums (d. 2018) (1990–1995)\nFreddy Votel – Drums (1995–1998)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nTaint Pluribus Taint Unum – Treehouse Records, 1987\nDaddy Has a Tail! – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 1989\nEffete and Impudent Snobs – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 1990\nPeacetika – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 1991\nCunning Stunts – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 1992\nSexy Pee Story – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 1993\nOrphan's Tragedy – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 1994\nWhorn – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 1996\nSorry in Pig Minor – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 1998\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nChow 7\" – Treehouse Records, 1988\nSlap Back 7\" – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 1990\nPlowed EP – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 1992\nWoman Inside 7\" – Insipid Records, 1992\nCow Island 7\" – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 1994\nThe Missing Letter Is You EP – Thick Records, 1998\nSugar Daddy Live Split Series Vol. 2 – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 2012 (split with the Melvins)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nOld Gold 1989-1991 – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 1995\nOrpheus’ Travesty – KMFMT Records, 1998 (A retrospective album put together by Kevin Rutmanis and Freddy Votel and sold before their final concert)\nStunning Cunts – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 2014 (Demos from Cunning Stunts)\nStunning Cunts Vol. 2 – Amphetamine Reptile Records, 2015 (Demos from Cunning Stunts)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Unofficial COWS Home Page"

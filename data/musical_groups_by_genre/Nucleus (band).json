    "text": "Nucleus was a British jazz-fusion band, which continued in different forms from 1969 to 1989. In 1970, the band won first prize at the Montreux Jazz Festival, released the album Elastic Rock, and performed both at the Newport Jazz Festival and the Village Gate jazz club.\nThe band was established by Ian Carr, who had been in the Rendell–Carr Quintet during the middle and late 1960s. Nucleus's debut album, Elastic Rock (1970), and the next two collections, We'll Talk About It Later and Solar Plexus (1971), were all released on Vertigo Records, and music journalist Colin Larkin noted were \"vital in any comprehensive rock or jazz collection\".\nIn August 2005, a reincarnation of Nucleus with old and new members performed at Cargo in London. This was followed on 30 March 2007 by a Nucleus Revisited concert at London's PizzaExpress Jazz Club as part of a series of concerts to mark the tenth anniversary of Jazzwise magazine. Nucleus Revisited included Geoff Castle, Mark Wood, and Tim Whitehead and on trumpet, as at the 2005 Cargo concert, Chris Batchelor. Although Ian Carr did not play due to ill health, he was present at the concert and received a standing ovation. On 4 August 2009, Nucleus Revisited appeared at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London with Michael Garrick's Quartet as part of their two-week-long Brit Jazz Fest.\n\n\n== Members ==\nIan Carr – trumpet\nChris Batchelor – trumpet\nHarry Beckett – trumpet\nKenny Wheeler – trumpet\nBob Bertles – tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone, flute\nBrian Smith – tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone, flute\nPhil Todd – tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone, flute\nTim Whitehead – tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone, flute\nKarl Jenkins – baritone saxophone, oboe, piano, electric piano\nTony Coe – clarinet, bass clarinet, tenor saxophone\nTony Roberts – clarinet, bass clarinet, tenor saxophone\nGeoff Castle – piano, electric piano, synthesizer\nKen Shaw - electric guitar\nGordon Beck – piano, electric piano\nDave MacRae – piano, electric piano\nJohn Taylor – organ\nPaddy Kingsland – synthesizer\nKeith Winter – synthesizer\nAllan Holdsworth – guitar\nJocelyn Pitchen – guitar\nRay Russell – guitar\nChris Spedding – guitar\nMark Wood – guitar\nRoy Babbington – bass guitar\nRob Burns – bass guitar\nJeff Clyne – bass guitar\nMo Foster – bass guitar\nJoe Hubbard – bass guitar\nBilly Kristian – bass guitar\nDill Katz – bass guitar\nRob Statham – bass guitar\nRoger Sutton – bass guitar\nRon Mathewson – bass guitar\nNeil Ardley – drums\nTony Levin – drums\nRoger Sellers – drums\nBryan Spring – drums\nJohn Marshall – drums\nClive Thacker – drums\nRichard Burgess – percussion\nChris Fletcher – percussion\nChris Karan – percussion\nAureo de Souza – percussion\nTrevor Tomkins – percussion\nKieran White – vocals\nNorma Winstone – vocals\nJoy Yates – vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\nElastic Rock (Vertigo, 1970) (UK No. 46)\nWe'll Talk About It Later (Vertigo, 1970)\nSolar Plexus with Ian Carr (Vertigo, 1971)\nBelladonna (Vertigo 1972, CD CD Linam Records)\nLabyrinth with Ian Carr (Vertigo, 1973)\nRoots (Vertigo, 1973)\nUnder the Sun (Vertigo, 1974)\nSnakehips Etcetera (Vertigo, 1975)\nAlleycat (Vertigo, 1975)\nIn Flagranti Delicto (Contemp, 1977)\nOut of the Long Dark (Capitol, 1979)\nAwakening (Mood, 1980)\nJazz London 29/30 with Brian Lemon (BBC, 1983)\nLive at the Theaterhaus (Mood, 1985)\nLive in Bremen (Cuneiform, 2003)\nThe Pretty Redhead (Hux, 2003)\nHemispheres (Hux, 2006)\nUK Tour '76 (Major League 2006)\nLive 1970 with Leon Thomas (Gearbox, 2014)\nThree of a Kind with Ian Carr (Gonzo, 2015)\nBracknell Sunshine with Ian Carr (Gonzo, 2016)\nLive At The BBC 13-CD box-set (Repertoire, 2021)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIan Carr and Nucleus website\nArticle about Nucleus at All About Jazz\nArticle about Ian Carr at All About Jazz\nArticle about Nucleus at Prog Archives\nNucleus discography at Discogs"

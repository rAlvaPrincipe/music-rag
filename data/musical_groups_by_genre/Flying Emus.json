    "text": "Flying Emus are an Australian country/bluegrass band that formed in 1984 and released four studio albums, including, This Town, which won an ARIA Award for Best Country Album in 1988. They disbanded in 1990. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 2013, John Kane (guitar, mandolin), announced they had reformed with other founders: his younger sister Genni Kane on lead vocals and guitar, Mike Kerin on violin and mandolin and Ian Simpson on banjo, joined by new member Michael Vidale on bass guitar.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1984–1991 ===\nIn 1984 the Flying Emus were formed in Sydney with Genni Kane and her older brother John Kane, Mike Kerin, and Ian Simpson, as a country, bluegrass group. In 1985 the band released their debut studio album, Look Out Below, which won Instrumental of the Year at the 1986 CMAA Country Music Awards. At the same ceremony they won Vocal Group of the Year for their song \"Diamond Creek\". At the 1987 CMAA awards, the band took Instrumental of the Year again, for the track \"Emu Strut\". In October 1986 they supported Steeleye Span in a show at the Canberra Theatre, where local correspondent Robert Hefner of The Canberra Times praised the vocals of Genni Kane, violin work by Kerin and banjo by Simpson.\nIn 1987 the band released This Town and in September of that year they supported Suzanne Vega at the Sydney Town Hall. Tharunka's Jim Dwyer felt the venue did not suit their intimate style. At the 1988 CMAA awards the group won Instrumental of the Year for the third consecutive year with the track \"Jackaroo\", and secured another Vocal Group of the Year for \"Auctioneer\". They won Best Country Album for This Town at the ARIA Music Awards of 1988.\nIn 1989 the band released Postcards from Paradise, which was nominated for an ARIA Award for Best Country Album in 1990. Also in that year they released their final studio album, Thank You and Goodnight, before breaking up. At the 1991 CMAA awards they won Instrumental of the Year for the fourth time with the track \"Dixie Breakdown\".\n\n\n=== 2013–present: Reformation and The Collection ===\nIn January 2013 at the Country Music Awards of Australia, band member John Kane announced the group were reforming. In December 2013 the Flying Emus announced a reunion tour for January 2014 with the four original members (John and Genni Kane, Simpson and Kerin) joined by Michael Vidale on bass. A compilation album, Flying Emus: The Collection, was released through Warner Music on 10 January 2014, with tracks from the band's four albums spanning from 1984 to 1990. 4ZZZ said, \"Pretty good at whatever they chose to do: country, pop, trad-folk, the Flying Emus were at their best, I think, when doing bluegrass. Bluegrass bands are renowned for their crazy soloing, but even amongst them The Flying Emus have the skills to make you do a double-take.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nGenni Kane (Genevieve Wilby) – lead vocals, guitar\nJohn Kane – guitar, mandolin\nMike Kerin – violin, mandolin, guitar, vocals\nIan Simpson – banjo, guitar\nHanuman Dass – percussion\nGraham Thompson – bass guitar\nMichael Vidale – bass guitar\nMalcolm Wakeford – drums, percussion\nWayne Goodwin – violin\nLucky Oceans – pedal steel guitar\nMichael Rose – pedal steel guitar\nCredits:\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== ARIA Music Awards ===\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music.

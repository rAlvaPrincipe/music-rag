    "text": "Standing on the Corner is an American avant-garde music collective led by Gio Escobar. Emerging from the New York underground art and music scene, they have been referred to as a post-genre band and praised for their use and blends of different sounds.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2014, Gio Escobar and Jack Nolan formed a guitar-based live group called Children of the Corner; the name was an homage to Harlem rap collective Children of the Corn. This project later evolved into Standing on the Corner. Escobar and Nolan wrote several tape machine-recorded songs that were not initially intended for release. Later Escobar brought some of those same demos he was working on to producer Jasper Marsalis, who helped produce them. Work on those songs resulted in the band's 2016 self-titled debut.\nIn 2017, Standing on the Corner released their second album Red Burns. Soon after the release of Red Burns, Marsalis left the group. In 2019, they contributed to Solange's album When I Get Home, with production and writing credits on the songs \"S McGregor (interlude)\", \"Can I Hold the Mic (interlude)\", \"Down With the Clique\", \"Nothing Without Intention (interlude)\", and \"Exit Scott (interlude)\". After their contributions to Solange's project, multi-instrumentalist Caleb Giles announced he was leaving the group on good terms to focus on his solo rap career.\nStanding on the Corner earned production credits on Danny Brown's 2019 album uknowhatimsayin¿ for the track \"Shine\". On May 11, 2020, they released the video for their single \"Angel\", starring Melvin Van Peebles. Peebles is a major influence for their catalog, with the group having sampled him multiple times, implementing spoken word passages into their record in a similar vein to Peebles' own albums.\nIn 2023, Standing on the Corner debuted the Taino Needle Science Drone Acupuncture Program, at Performance Space New York. The program ran from February 1 to June 30.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nGio Escobar (born Giovanni Cortez) - vocals, production, guitar, bass (2014–present)\nJack Nolan - guitar, bass (2014–present)\nStanding on the Corner Art Ensemble (2019–present)\nNate Cox\nSyl Dubenion\nSavannah Harris\nBuz\nClerida Eltimé\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nCaleb Giles - vocals, production, saxophone (2015–2019)\nJasper Marsalis - production (2016–2017)\nOluwaseun Odubiro - bass, production (2017–2020)\nTomin Perea-Chamblee - cornet, alto clarinet, bass clarinet (2018-2020)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nStanding on the Corner (2016)\nRed Burns (2017)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nG-E-T-O-U-T!!

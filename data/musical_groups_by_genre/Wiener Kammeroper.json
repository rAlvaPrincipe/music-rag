It has been managed by Theater an der Wien since 2012.\n\n\n== History ==\nInitially, the company had no dedicated building. Performances were held at the Konzerthaus and at Schönbrunn Palace. In 1961 a subsidy from the Ministry of Education and the City of Vienna allowed the company to establish a permanent venue in the former ballroom of the Hotel Post on Fleischmarkt Street, where the dance hall was converted to an opera stage. The new theatre was inaugurated with a performance of short operas: Martinů's The Marriage, Giuseppe Maria Orlandini' Il marito giocatore, and Monteverdi's Lamento d'arianna. as adapted by Carl Orff.\nEarly programs at the Opera House included opera buffa, operettas, parodies and traditional Viennese Singspiel, as well as chamber arrangements of larger works such as Bizez's Carmen and Puccini's La Bohème. Today, the focus is on premieres of contemporary works and the development of young performers. Chamber operas by Tom Johnson, Peter Maxwell Davies, Luciano Chailly, Philip Glass and Hans Werner Henze were premiered at the Kammeroper. The company has also staged rock operas that translate classics such as La Bohème and Carmen for a younger generation.\nGabor retired from conducting in 1982 while continuing as the company's artistic director and manager. In 1983 the theater launched Studio K, a series featuring contemporary works and composers. In 1992 the theater began a series of open-air performances of Mozart operas at the Roman Ruin of Schönbrunn Palace. Conservationists determined in 1999 that the monument was in jeopardy, and performances were discontinued.\nIn 1994 Hans Gabor died unexpectedly and Rudolf Berger continued programming. During the 1999/2000 season Isabella Gabor and Holger Bleck took over the management of the Kammeroper.\nIn 2012, Theater an der Wien took over management of the company and Sebastian F.

They have achieved four number-one singles and six additional top-ten songs on the UK Official Singles Chart. Since 2016, the group have been a trio comprising founding members Grace Chatto and brothers Jack and Luke Patterson. Jack serves as the principal songwriter. The group are known for blending elements of classical music and contemporary dance music, and they routinely collaborate with guest vocalists.\nClean Bandit's debut single, \"A+E\", was released in 2012; their second, \"Mozart's House\" (2013), peaked at number 17 on the UK singles chart. In 2014, they attained mainstream success with their single \"Rather Be\", a collaboration with Jess Glynne. It reached number one on the UK singles chart, topped the national singles charts of six other countries, and peaked at number ten on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song's accolades include a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording and two Ivor Novello Awards for Jack Patterson. These three singles were included on the group's debut album New Eyes, released in June 2014, which received a gold certification from the BPI. Clean Bandit's 2016 single \"Rockabye\", which features Sean Paul and Anne-Marie, became their second number-one song in the UK and that year's UK Christmas number-one single. It peaked at number one in seven other markets and charted at number nine in the United States. In 2017, \"Symphony\", featuring Zara Larsson, became the group's third UK number-one song; this was followed by their fourth, \"Solo\", featuring Demi Lovato, in 2018.

    "text": "The Stingrays are a British new wave band, which was originally formed in 1977 in Bristol, England, by Welsh musician Russ Mainwaring and Dean Sidney and are still gigging today. (There are at least three notable bands that have called themselves The Stingrays, Sting Rays or a permutation of the name). They have experienced various line up changes over the years, but have included: Russ Mainwaring (who is still a member), Bill Stair (Art Objects, Various Artists, Blue Aeroplanes), Chris Bostock, Sean McLuskey (Subway Sect, JoBoxers, If?) and Paul Johnson (Massive Attack).\nTheir first single, Countdown, was released on local label Fried Egg Records in 1980. They also contributed the track, \"Sound\", to the seminal Heartbeat Records compilation album, Avon Calling.\nThe mini-album, The Stingrays At the Dugout in '77: The Sound of Two Hands Clapping, was recorded by Simon Edwards (of Heartbeat Records) live at the Dug Out Club, Park Row, Bristol. According to Steve Bush of Essential Bop, they were \"a bit like Bristol's equivalent of The Ramones.

    "text": "Doldrums were an American post-rock band formed in Fairfax, Virginia, United States. Formed in 1994, the group consisted of guitarist Justin Chearno, bassist Bill Kellum and drummer Matt Kellum. Most of the band's music is completely improvised, with little or no overdubs. Bill Kellum has cited psychedelic music and krautrock as being particularly influential to him. The band never toured and has not released an album since 2000's Feng Shui.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSecret Life of Machines (1995, VHF)\nAcupuncture (1997, Kranky)\nDesk Trickery (1999, Kranky)\nFeng Shui (2000, VHF)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDoldrums at AllMusic\nDoldrums discography at Discogs"

    "text": "Bastille are  an English indie pop band formed in 2010. The group began as a solo project by lead vocalist Dan Smith, but later expanded to include keyboardist Kyle Simmons, bassist and guitarist Will Farquarson and drummer Chris \"Woody\" Wood.\nAfter an independently released debut single and a self-released EP, the band signed to Virgin Records. Their first studio album, Bad Blood, was released in March 2013 and entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and included the hit single \"Pompeii\" which peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. Bastille released the album in the US later that year. Their second studio album, Wild Word, was released in September 2016 and was followed by Doom Days, Bastille's third studio album, in June 2019. In February 2022, Bastille released their fourth studio album, Give Me the Future. Their fifth studio album, \"&\", was released in October 2024.\nBastille's music has been featured in television shows, films, video games, and advertisements. Bastille was nominated for four Brit Awards at the 2014 ceremony, winning the British Breakthrough Act. As of August 2021, the band have sold over eleven million records worldwide.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early releases (2010–2011) ===\nBastille debuted in July 2010 with their limited edition 7\" single that featured the two tracks \"Flaws\" and \"Icarus\". Released through London-based independent record label Young & Lost Club, only 300 copies were pressed. One of the copies found its way into the hands of Alex Baker, presenter of the unsigned/independent artists radio show on Kerrang! Radio. Baker started to support Bastille on air, and the band began to find an audience. They released the EP Laura Palmer themselves later in 2011. After releasing further tracks online through sites such as YouTube and MySpace, the band's audience started to grow. In December 2011, Smith signed a contract with Virgin Records. The group subsequently secured a few support slots and later performed at major UK festivals including Glastonbury, the Isle of Wight, Redfest, Reading and Leeds Festival and Blissfields. The band also recorded and released two parts of their mix-tape titled Other People's Heartache for free.\n\n\n=== Bad Blood and All This Bad Blood (2012–2014) ===\n\nOn 27 April 2012, their first official single release, \"Overjoyed\", was released through Virgin Records, as confirmed by EMI on 1 May 2012. Following its video premiere in November 2011, popular music publication, Q Magazine introduced the track as its 'Track of the Day' for 7 March 2012. The second single to be released from the upcoming debut studio album, Bad Blood, was the title track, \"Bad Blood\". An accompanying video for the single was released on the band's official VEVO channel on 29 June 2012, and digitally through Virgin Records on 20 August 2012. Bastille was also named 'New Band of the Day' by The Guardian in July 2012. The song charted moderately at number 90 in the United Kingdom and saw the group's first entry into the chart. In August 2012, the band performed at UK festivals like Reading and Leeds, as well as supporting British singer-songwriter Emeli Sandé. They later played a small headlining tour, titled 'Flaws Tour' in October 2012, with Swiss Lips as their support act. In November 2012, the band performed at Hong Kong's Clockenflap Music and Arts Festival, their first outside of Europe. Their third single, a re-release of their first 7\" non-album single \"Flaws\", was a commercial success, earning the group their first position in the UK Top 40, debuting at number-twenty-one.\n\nIn February 2013, Bastille confirmed the release of the fourth single to be taken from Bad Blood, \"Pompeii\". The song was positively reviewed by critics, reaching number two in the United Kingdom and number five in the US. Their debut album Bad Blood was released on 4 March 2013, and placed at number one in the UK Albums Chart. On 11 March, Bastille was announced to be playing at the Reading and Leeds Festival in August 2013.\"Laura Palmer\" was released on 3 June 2013, and an accompanying video for the track premiered through the band's official VEVO page on 12 April 2013. The group joined English rock band Muse as a supporting act on their The 2nd Law Tour in May 2013 and did so again in June 2013. In May 2013, Bastille released their Haunt EP in the US via iTunes. On Saturday 6 July, the band headlined their first UK summer music festival at Blissfields. Smith said, \"We're massively excited about our first ever headline slot at a festival. Particularly because we love Blissfields so much, and because they've been so supportive to us over the last couple of years.\" The performance coincided with the band appearing on the cover of a national music publication, Notion magazine, for the first time. On 24 August 2013, \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" was released as the sixth single from the band's debut album. A music video for the song was shot in Vilnius and Kėdainiai, Lithuania. On 3 September 2013, Bastille released their Bad Blood album in the US via iTunes.\nOn 9 October 2013, Bastille released a new single, \"Of the Night\", a mash-up of the songs \"The Rhythm of the Night\" by Corona and \"Rhythm Is a Dancer\" by Snap!. The single debuted at number two on UK Singles Chart. The song was promoting All This Bad Blood, a reissue of the band's debut album, released on 25 November 2013. In January 2014, Will Farquarson said in an interview with Billboard magazine that the band had already started to work on its second album in between tour dates. The band performed on Saturday Night Live on 25 January 2014. On 4 February 2014 Bastille won the BRIT Award for Best Breakthrough Act and performed a remixed version of \"Pompeii\" with Rudimental and their song \"Waiting All Night\" at the ceremony. Two hours after their appearance, sales of Bad Blood were up by 132% to give them a second week at number one in the UK album chart and \"Pompeii\" had climbed 29 places in the singles. On 1 April 2014, the Official Charts Company announced that Bad Blood was the biggest selling digital album of 2013, and Number 11 in the over-all Official Artist Albums Top 40 of 2013. Also in April 2014, the band performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California.

On 13 July 2014, Bastille played at T in the Park. In September 2014, they released the last single from Bad Blood, \"Oblivion\". The Bad Blood Tour finished in 2014.\n\n\n=== VS. and Wild World (2014–2017) ===\n\nIn late 2013, Bastille began to play new songs called \"Blame\" and \"Campus\". Another song called \"Oil On Water\" was played during sound-check and leaked online. They began proper work on the album in 2014, and planned to start recording it in September. Farquarson said that they had \"16 or 17 tracks\" demoed already for the album. He also said, “We’re going into the studio in September to record; hopefully by then we’ll have 20 or maybe more. I think it’s always better to have more material and whittle it down. Our producer has gone on tour with us, so we’ve been doing things on our days off and during sound-checks.\" Dan Smith said the album will include more guitars, saying \"we didn't have much of that on the first album and it may not end up on it but it would be quite interesting to try it out. We feel quite free. If we want to go quite electronic then we can and if we want to go rockier and indie then we can.\" On 21 October 2014, Bastille announced their third mixtape, VS. (Other People's Heartache, Pt.III) with the release of their song \"Torn Apart\", featuring the artists Grades and Lizzo, on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show. They also wrote and recorded the song \"The Driver\" for the re-score of the film Drive which was released a week later and also featured on the mixtape. VS. (Other People's Heartache, Pt.III) was released on 8 December 2014 and featured the Gemma Sharples Quartet, Haim, MNEK, Tyde, Rationale, Lizzo, Grades, Angel Haze, F*U*G*Z, Braque, Rag'n'Bone Man, and Skunk Anansie.

On 1 September 2023, the band released a commemorative orchestral rendition of \"Pompeii\", collaborating with composer Hans Zimmer on the project. Titled \"Pompeii MMXXIII\", the release of the song coincided with the 10th anniversary of the track's original release in 2013.\n\n\n=== \"&\" (2024–present) ===\nOn 22 July 2024, Bastille announced a four-part project named \"&\" (pronounced \"ampersand\"). The first four songs from the project were released four days later, with a full album due for release on 25 October. The project, a concept album based on personal stories in history, features acoustic songs written by Dan Smith with collaborators being featured as instrumentalists.\n\n\n== Name, musical style and influences ==\nThe name of the band derives from Bastille Day, which is celebrated on 14 July, Smith's birthday.\nBastille's musical style has been described as indie pop, pop rock, synth-pop, electropop, alternative rock, pop, and indie rock. Smith himself has characterized their music as heavily cinematic. This is evident in their second studio album, Wild World, and their Other People's Heartache mixtapes, which incorporate audio clips from various sources, including television, film, and even a United States Department of Justice informational video. Smith's affinity for film stems from his upbringing, where he viewed it as his primary obsession. He has mentioned that incorporating samples from movies into their songs was a natural progression for the band, starting with their first mixtape, Other People's Heartache. In an article published by music magazine The Line of Best Fit, Smith writes: \"Our mixtapes started life with a cover that we used to play of “What Would You Do?” by City High, back when we only had about six songs we could play live. We needed something to fill out the set and it was a song that I remembered affectionately from when I was a kid. Whenever we played it people would find themselves singing along and trying to figure out where they knew it from\".\nAnother large influence on the band's earlier works was director David Lynch. For instance, the penultimate track on Bastille's album Bad Blood, titled \"Laura Palmer\", pays tribute to the tragic prom queen from Lynch's Twin Peaks. The album's cover, featuring Dan Smith caught in a car's headlights on a nocturnal country road, also exudes a Lynchian feel. Moreover, another single, \"Falling\", from their mixtape Other People's Heartache, integrates parts of the song \"Falling\" by Julee Cruise, known as the theme song for Twin Peaks, mixed with their own song \"Laura Palmer\". In fact, Rob Da Bank, who was releasing Lynch's second album, approached Smith to do a remix of one of Lynch's songs. Lynch's positive reception of the remix further solidified their connection, culminating in a personal invitation to his house for coffee. This encounter left a lasting impression on Smith, as he described Lynch as \"overwhelmingly kind, funny, and inquisitive\" in an article published on Redbull's website.\nBastille was also one of the artists involved in \"Radio 1 Rescores Drive,\" a collaborative initiative spearheaded by DJ and radio presenter Zane Lowe. The band contributed \"The Driver\" to the soundtrack for the 2011 film Drive starring Ryan Gosling, and the song was included on Bastille's own mixtape, VS. (Other People's Heartache, Pt. III).\nArguably, the band's most high-profile collaboration with an important figure from the movie industry came in the form of their single \"Pompeii MMXXIII\", alongside Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer, transforming Bastille's chart-topping \"Pompeii\" into an almost a cappella version reminiscent of Zimmer's iconic film soundtracks. Speaking about this collaboration, Smith expressed a profound sense of validation and honor to work alongside a revered figure like Zimmer, stating, “It does feel like we have come full circle in a way. So many of the songs we have, particularly on Bad Blood, have strings or loads of choir parts which I sang. So to get to a point where we can do this version with a real choir and orchestra and with someone like Zimmer – who is responsible for so many huge cultural moments for me – is exciting and a privilege.” \nThe band's repertoire also often includes covers and samples from a variety of artists. Examples include their rendition of \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\" by Roberta Flack in the Bad Blood X version of their album Bad Blood, \"Dancing in the Dark\" by Bruce Springsteen for the edition \"Give Me The Future + Dreams of the Past\" of the studio album Give Me the Future, \"Can't Fight This Feeling\" by REO Speedwagon (featured in a Christmas advert for British department store John Lewis & Partners in 2019 ), and \"Basket Case\" by Green Day (released as a soundtrack for The Tick TV series.)\nFrontman Dan Smith has cited as influences many artists including Kate Bush, Amy Winehouse, Lorde, Christine and the Queens, and the Cranberries.  He has particularly highlighted Regina Spektor as an early influence on his songwriting. During an interview with MTV UK, he shared: \"When I first heard 'Us' by Regina Spektor, it made me want to record and write songs. I thought the way she told this quite weird story with her words was amazing, and I liked how interesting and unique her voice was. I'm someone with quite a weird annoying voice, so that made me think, well, if she can do it, I can have a crack. [...] I thought the production was really beautiful, simple, on piano. [...] That made me think that this slightly weird, awkward teenager who could sort of play piano and sort of sing could start writing songs.\"\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nBastille's music has been used on the TV soap Hollyoaks with one week in the early summer of 2012 focused on Bastille's song \"Laura Palmer\". Their music also has been on: Made in Chelsea and Waterloo Road. The song \"Oblivion\" was featured in season 4 episode 9 of The Vampire Diaries in December 2012. \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" was used for the 2014 autumn trailer for English soap opera EastEnders. They can also be heard on Teen Wolf and on the fourth episode of How to Get Away with Murder with the Naughty Boy collaboration \"No One's Here to Sleep\". The song \"Haunt\" can be heard in the season 1 finale of the TV series Finding Carter. Song \"Blame\" is featured in season 1 episode 4 of Marvel series Runaways.\nIn August 2017, the band released a version of the Green Day song \"Basket Case\" for the Peter Serafinowicz series The Tick.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nTheir song \"Pompeii\" is featured in the 2014 movie Mr. Peabody & Sherman. The band's song \"The Driver\" was used in the re-scored soundtrack of the 2011 film Drive produced for the BBC by Zane Lowe for its October 2014 TV broadcast.

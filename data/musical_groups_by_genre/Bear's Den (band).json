    "text": "Bear's Den are a British alternative country and indie folk band from London, formed in 2012 and consisting of Andrew Davie (lead vocals, electric guitar, acoustic guitar) and Kevin Jones (vocals, drums, bass, guitar). Joey Haynes (vocals, banjo, guitar) left in early 2016. Since their 2016/2017 tour in Europe and North America, Haynes has been replaced by Dutch artist Christof van der Ven, not as an official member but as a session musician.\nBear's Den have released five studio albums: Islands (2014), Red Earth & Pouring Rain (2016), So That You Might Hear Me (2019), Fragments (2020), and Blue Hours  (2022). Islands peaked at number 49 on the UK Albums Chart. They have also issued seven EPs and numerous singles.\nThe band has been nominated for several music awards throughout their career, with \"Above the Clouds of Pompeii\" earning them a nomination for the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically, in 2015. They received two nominations at the UK Americana Awards in 2016, as Artist of the Year and Song of the Year, for \"Agape\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2012–2014: Early years and tours ===\nThe band's first tour involved them travelling across the United States in Volkswagen camper vans with Ben Howard, Nathaniel Rateliff, and the Staves. It was made into a 2014 documentary titled Austin to Boston by James Marcus Haney, which premiered at the 58th BFI London Film Festival.\nSince then, the band has toured the US several times, in support of Mumford & Sons and Daughter and as headliners. They also toured the UK supporting Smoke Fairies in 2012 and Australia with Matt Corby in October 2013.\nIn June 2014, the band received the £2,500 Momentum Deezer Award from the PRS for Music Foundation.\n\n\n=== 2014–2016: Islands ===\nOn 20 October 2014, Bear's Den released their debut album, Islands, on Communion Records, a label founded in 2006 by Kevin Jones, with Ben Lovett of Mumford & Sons and producer Ian Grimble.\nThe album spent ten weeks on the UK Official Charts, peaking at #49. Islands appeared at #7 in the first official UK Americana Chart and at #9 in the top-selling Americana albums of 2015.\nIn March 2015, the song \"Above the Clouds of Pompeii\" was nominated for the Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.\nIn October, Islands was re-released as a deluxe edition featuring an extra CD of live tracks.\nThat year, the band sold out their extensive UK, Europe, and US tours. They performed at international festivals such as Reading and Leeds, Glastonbury, Lollapalooza, Citadel, Somersault, NOS Alive, BBK, Squamish, Pukkelpop, Lowlands, Bonnaroo, and Dockville.\nOn 4 February 2016, Joey Haynes announced via the band's Facebook page that he was leaving the group to spend more time with family and friends.\nOn 14 October 2016, just under two years since its release, Islands was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry, in recognition of 60,000 sales. It was certified Gold in 2023.\n\n\n=== 2016–2019: Red Earth & Pouring Rain ===\nOn 4 April 2016, the band released a trailer in anticipation of their second album, Red Earth & Pouring Rain, which came out on 22 July. They also announced a tour of Europe for Autumn 2016, including their biggest headline show to date, at Brixton Academy.\n\n\n=== 2019–2020: So That You Might Hear Me ===\nIn January 2019, Bear's Den changed their social media design after almost three years, and a website was sent to people affiliated to their official page, called \"So That You Might Hear Me\", the title of their next album. Four days later, it was revealed that the record would be released on 26 April 2019. They also released two singles the next day: \"Blankets of Sorrow\" and \"Fuel on the Fire\". On 4 March, they issued a third single, \"Laurel Wreath\". On 12 February 2019, a podcast bearing the album's name was announced. Hosted by Danny Carissimi, each episode explored one song on the album through interviews with Davie and Jones. In August 2019, the band headed off on the Highlands and Islands tour of Scotland. It was a stripped-back acoustic affair, and they were joined onstage by Christof van der Ven and Marcus Hamblett.\n\n\n=== 2020–present: Fragments and Blue Hours ===\nOn 26 June 2020, Bear's Den posted a snippet of the Fragments version of \"Fuel on the Fire\" and changed their social media design. Over the next two days, the Fragments versions of \"Napoleon\" and \"When You Break\" were teased.\nOn 1 July 2020, the band announced a studio recording of the Fragments shows they had done with Paul Frith in 2018, consisting of orchestral reinterpretations of the band's music.\nOn 17 November 2021, \"All That You Are\", the first single from the band's fourth studio album, Blue Hours, was released. This was followed by \"Spiders\", on 19 January 2022. At the same time, the band announced that Blue Hours would be published on 13 May 2022 and accompanied by a European and North American tour, their first since 2020.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nEP (2012)\nAgape (2013)\nWithout/Within (2013)\nElysium (2014)\nOnly Son of the Falling Snow (2019)\nChristmas, Hopefully (2020)\nFirst Loves (2023)\nWhite Magnolias (2023)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Agape\" (2013)\n\"Writing on the Wall\" (2013)\n\"Above the Clouds of Pompeii\" (2014)\n\"Elysium\" (2014)\n\"Think of England\" (2015)\n\"Auld Wives\" (2016)\n\"Emeralds\" (2016)\n\"Dew on the Vine\" (2016)\n\"Berlin\" (2016)\n\"Fuel on the Fire\" (2019)\n\"Blankets of Sorrow\" (2019)\n\"Laurel Wreath\" (2019)\n\"Crow\" (2019)\n\"Only Son of the Falling Snow\" (2019)\n\"Christmas, Hopefully\" (2020)\n\"All That You Are\" (2021)\n\"Spiders\" (2022)\n\"Blue Hours\" (2022)\n\"A Good Love, Pt. 2\" (2022)\n\"Please Don't Hide Yourself Away\" (2022)\n\"Team\" (2022)\n\"Stitch in Time\" (2022)\n\"Honest Mistake\" (2022)\n\"Evelyn\" (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

    "text": "Prospa is an English electronic music duo consisting of Leeds-born Harvey Blumler and Gosha Smith.\n\n\n== History ==\nBlumler and Smith, both from Leeds, became friends as children. Blumler experimented with heavy dubstep sounds, while Smith stated that he used to not like dance music. Instead, he listened to metal guitar, jazz, and later, jazz hip hop. When Smith began producing music, jazz-inspired hip hop was the first genre he experimented with. The pair eventually found a mutual interest in dance music, and started producing together in 2013. They spent two years producing deep house, but stopped after they \"fell out of love with the sound\".\nProspa had its first major hit with \"Prayer\", released in October 2018. The song was picked up by Annie Mac who selected it for her \"Hottest Record in the World\" feature.\nThe pair have gone on to release their music under their own label \"Rave Science\", part of Polydor Records.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe pair experimented with different musical styles. Discussing their influences, the pair cite The Chemical Brothers and Daft Punk.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nMachines (2017)\nRave Science Vol. 1 (2021)\nRave Science Vol. 2 (2021)\nClose Your Eyes (with KETTAMA) (2022)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Seizm\" (2017)\n\"The System / Evacuate\" (2018)\n\"Intended / \"Get That\" (2019)\n\"Information\" (2019)\n\"Prayer\" (2019)\n\"Back To The Motherland\" (2019)\n\"Guitar Anthem\" (2019)\n\"Control The Party\" (2019)\n\"The One\" (2020)\n\"Ecstacy (Over & Over)\" (2020)\n\"Feel It 92\" (2020)\n\"The Thrill\" (2020)\n\"WANT NEED LOVE\" (2021)\n\"Make The Night Last\" (2022)\n\"Made 4 U\" (2022)\n\"One Of A Kind\" (2023)\n\"Will You Be Mine\" (2023)\n\"Waiheke Island\" (with Skream) (2023)\n\"Heartbeat (Dance The Night Away)\" (2023)\n\n\n== References =="

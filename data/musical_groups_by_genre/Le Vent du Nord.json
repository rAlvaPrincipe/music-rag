    "text": "Le Vent du Nord (The North Wind) is a Canadian folk music group from Saint-Antoine-sur-Richelieu in Quebec. The band performs traditional Québécois music (which is heavily influenced by Celtic music from both Ireland and Brittany), as well as original numbers in this style, in French. In 2018 the group's membership consists of Simon Beaudry (vocals, guitar, Irish bouzouki), Nicolas Boulerice (vocals, hurdy-gurdy, piano accordion, piano), André Brunet (vocals, fiddle, podorythmie), Réjean Brunet (vocals, diatonic button accordion, acoustic bass guitar, piano and jaw harp) and Olivier Demers (vocals, fiddle, podorythmie, and guitar). Their first eight recordings have been nominated for multiple awards.\n\n\n== History ==\nLe Vent du Nord was formed in 2002. Nicolas Boulerice and Olivier Demers founded the band with Sébastien Dufour and Frédéric Samson.  This lineup lasted only a short time, changing once they met Benoit Bourque (vocals, diatonic button accordion, mandolin, bones, and step dancing) in Vancouver later the same year. With the same interest and passion in folk music, and despite the fact that all were engaged in other musical groups at that time, they decided to continue together. Bernard Simard also joined the group on guitar and vocals in the same period. The band officially started in September 2002, and their first album, Maudite Moisson, was released through Borealis Recordings in 2003. The album won a Juno Award for Roots and Traditional Group Album of the Year.\nIn 2004, Simard was replaced by Simon Beaudry. Bourque was replaced by Réjean Brunet in April 2007. The band performed at the Mémoire et Racines festival in Joliette in July 2008, and later released a recording of this performance, Mesdames et Messieurs. Their 2009 album La part du feu was included in the Top Ten Folk Albums of 2009 by The Boston Globe, and the Top Ten International Albums of 2009 by the Los Angeles Times.\nIn 2010 the group released an album, Symphonique, and was named Ensemble of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards. Their album La part du feu won a  2011 Juno Award. Another album, Tromper le Temps, was released in 2012.\nLe Vent du Nord released their eighth album, Tetu, in 2015, and the following year band performed in London, England.\nIn late 2017, the fifth member of the band, André Brunet, joined the group.\nOn February 12, 2019, they released their ninth album, \"Territoires\", at Théâtre Fairmont in Montreal.\nOn December 30, 2023 during their performance as part of La Veillée de l'avant-Veille, for their final song (before encore) \"Ma Louise\", Simon Beaudry's brother and sister joined the stage, and the lyrics transitioned from \"au revoir ma Louise, au revoir\" to \"au revoir ma Simon, au revoir\", signalling Simon's departure from the band.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nMaudite Moisson!

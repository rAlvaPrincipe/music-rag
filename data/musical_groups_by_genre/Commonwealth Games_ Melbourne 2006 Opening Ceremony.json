The ceremony took place on 15 March 2006 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the live album was released by Sony BMG Music Entertainment Australia on 19 March 2006. Performers included Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, the Church, the Cat Empire, Ursula Yovich and Delta Goodrem. The score was written by Christopher Gordon, and was commissioned by the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games Committee. The performance was partly funded by the Australian Government's Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.\nIt peaked at No. 56 on the ARIA Albums Chart, with ARIA's Ian Wallace determining the highlights were, \"The Church's collaboration with Melbourne Symphony Orchestra for the song 'Under the Milky Way', Delta Goodrem singing the track 'Together We Are One' in which she co-wrote with her boyfriend Brian McFadden especially for the Games, and the track 'Cities' by The Cat Empire.\" In December 2006 it was certified gold by ARIA for shipment of 35000 copies. Adrian Regan of Museums Victoria analysed the opening ceremony, which provided an overarching story of \"a young boy's journey. [It] was told through three main 'creative segments'.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nCatalogue number: 82876820592\n\n\"Countdown\" – Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\"Journey to the Stadium\" – Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\"Welcome to the MCG\" – Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\"Raising of the 3 Nation Flags\" – Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\"The Arrival of the Head of the Commonwealth\" – Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\"The National Anthem\" – Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\"Welcome to Melbourne\" – Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\"Boy on the Bay\" – Melbourne Symphony Orchestra & Young Voices of Melbourne\n\"My Skin My Life\" – David Page, vocals by Ursula Yovich\n\"Under the Milky Way\" – The Church & Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\"Cities\" – The Cat Empire\n\"Queen's Baton Relay\" – Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\"Raising of the CGF Flag\" – Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\"Together We Are One\" – Delta Goodrem\n\"Finale\" – Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCommonwealth Games: Melbourne 2006 Closing Ceremony\n2006 Commonwealth Games\n2006 Commonwealth Games Opening Ceremony\n\n\n== References =="

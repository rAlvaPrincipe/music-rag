    "text": "Changing Faces is an American female R&B duo that was initially active between the years 1994 until their hiatus in 2000.\nIn August 2009, a new Changing Faces song was leaked online called \"Crazy Luv\". The song was rumored to be on their new album, but was not confirmed by Lucas or Rose to be their comeback single off their new album, which was rumored to be released sometime in 2012.\nOn September 18, 2011, during a special appearance at the RnB Spotlight Concert with Lil Mo' at BB King's Blues Club in NYC, Changing Faces member Lucas announced on Kempire Radio and on YouKnowIGotSoul.com that she and Rose were in the recording studio working on a new Changing Faces project that would be released in 2012, with a new single being released soon. She also stated that the group never broke up and was working with R. Kelly on new music.\nOn April 3, 2013, Changing Faces released a new single \"Hate Love\" via iTunes. A music video was filmed but was not released.\nIn 2014, Changing Faces was scheduled to perform at an Rhythm & Blues Superstars concert in the United Kingdom - however, Rose brought along Reefy Scott who is also the new member of the group to tour and perform without telling Lucas. As a result, Lucas filed a lawsuit towards Rose - despite the duo mutually agreeing to halt any plans for a reunion.\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\nIn September 2013, it was announced that Cassandra Lucas was working on a solo album in addition to forming a new label CRC Musik with her husband Noel “Chris” Absolam and business partner Richard Smith. Her debut solo single, \"Damn\" was released on September 3, 2013. She released subsequent singles \"Music & a Beat\" in July 2017 as well as \"Give Love a Chance\" and \"I Love You\" later that year.\nLucas’ first single \"Name on It\" premiered in January 2018 and became a hit on the Urban AC chart. Her second single \"Take Me Home (Remix)\" featuring Ron Browz and HoodCelebrityy will receive major  promotion with the music video scheduled to film throughout the historical African American Day Parade in Lucas's Hometown of Harlem.\nIn April 2019, Cassandra Lucas released her debut solo album Long Way Home... The Intro.\nCharisse Rose performed at a 1990s World Pride Concert in June 2019 with Reefy Scott as the new member.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== Featured singles ====\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nChanging Faces at AllMusic\n(in French) La biographie SoulRnB.com consacrée à Changing Faces"

    "text": "Mamamoo (Korean: 마마무; Japanese: ママム; commonly stylized in all caps) is a South Korean girl group formed and managed by RBW. The group is composed of four members: Solar, Moonbyul, Wheein, and Hwasa. Known for their strong live vocals, harmonies, and writing much of their material, they are recognized as one of the premier girl groups in K-pop. They are highly regarded in the industry for their talent and ability to cross multiple genres with their music; from retro, jazz, and R&B concepts in their early years to more contemporary hip-hop, as well as emotional ballads. Since their debut in 2014, they have been noted for challenging conventional beauty standards, breaking gender stereotypes, and conducting themselves in ways that most typical K-pop stars do not.\nMamamoo officially debuted on June 18, 2014, with their first extended play (EP) Hello, featuring the lead single \"Mr. Ambiguous\". Their debut was considered by critics as one of the best K-pop debuts of 2014. Mamamoo rose to domestic fame in 2015 with their single \"Um Oh Ah Yeah\" which became a sleeper hit and peaked at number three on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart. Combined with their many appearances and victories in the popular music competition program Immortal Songs, this launched them into mainstream recognition with the public. Their following release of \"You're the Best\" (2016) from their debut studio album Melting, proved to be a commercial success, and dominated at least eight major music sites upon release, further cementing their popularity and growing momentum. In 2017, they made a splash on the international scene with their fifth EP, Purple. Its lead single \"Yes I Am,\" earned them their first number one on the Billboard World Albums chart.\nThe quartet went on to achieve consecutive hits with the high-charting singles \"Starry Night\" (2018), \"Egotistic\" (2018), \"Gogobebe\" (2019), from their \"Four Seasons, Four Colors\" project whereby every member took turns in becoming the focus for each album. This culminated in their biggest international success to date, \"HIP\" from their second studio album Reality in Black becoming a number-one hit on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart. In November 2020, the song was certified platinum by the Korea Music & Content Association (KMCA) for surpassing 100 million streams, making it their third time achieving this feat. They also earned a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), indicating their breakthrough in the Japanese music scene.\nMamamoo has received numerous accolades, most notably the Golden Disc Award for Best Group, the Mnet Asian Music Award for Best Vocal Group, multiple honors at the Seoul Music Awards, as well as the Gaon Chart Music Award for New Artist of the Year in their rookie year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2014–2015: Formation, debut and rising popularity ===\nThe group's name \"Mamamoo\" is intended to symbolise a baby babbling for the first time. This is because they aim to make music that would be familiar to everyone around the world like the word \"mama\" that babies would commonly first learn and speak of, as well as the added meaning of approaching their listeners instinctively with their music.\nPrior to their official debut, Mamamoo collaborated with several artists. Their first collaboration, titled \"Don't Be Happy\" with Bumkey was released on January 8, 2014. A second collaboration with K.Will titled \"Peppermint Chocolate\" featuring Wheesung was released on February 11, 2014. \"Peppermint Chocolate\" debuted at number 11 on the Gaon Digital Chart in its first week. On May 30, 2014, Mamamoo released a collaboration single called \"HeeHeeHaHeHo\" with rap duo Geeks.\nThe group made their official debut on June 18, 2014, with the lead single \"Mr. Ambiguous\" from their first extended play (EP) Hello. The music video for \"Mr. Ambiguous\" contained cameo appearances from many well-known K-pop industry figures such as CNBLUE's Jonghyun, Baek Ji-young, Wheesung, Jung Joon-young, Bumkey, K.Will, and Rhymer of Brand New Music. The album contained three previously released collaborations and four new songs. The group made their first live appearance on the June 19 episode of M Countdown. In July 2014, Mamamoo released their first original soundtrack contribution titled \"Love Lane\" for the Korean drama Marriage, Not Dating.\nOn November 21, 2014, Mamamoo released their second EP Piano Man with the title track of the same name. The title song peaked at 41 on Gaon's Digital chart. By the end of 2014, Mamamoo ranked tenth highest among idol girl groups for digital sales, 19th in album sales, and 11th in overall sales according to Gaon's year-end rankings. On January 10, 2015, Mamamoo performed a rendition of Joo Hyun-mi's \"Wait a Minute\" at the singing show Immortal Songs 2, reaching the final round before losing to Kim Kyung-ho.\n\nOn April 2, 2015, Mamamoo released \"Ahh Oop!\", the first single of their third EP titled Pink Funky. \"Ahh Oop!\" marks the group's second collaboration with label mate Esna, after she was featured in \"Gentleman\" on their second EP Piano Man. On June 13, 2015, the group traveled to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, to perform at an event sponsored by the South Korean Embassy with Crayon Pop and K-Much. The event was a commemorative concert held in honor of the 25th anniversary of diplomatic ties between South Korea and Mongolia.\nOn June 19, 2015, Mamamoo released their third EP Pink Funky and lead single \"Um Oh Ah Yeh\". The song was a commercial success, peaking at number three on the Gaon Chart, becoming their first top-three single. On August 23, 2015, after promotions concluded, Mamamoo held their first fan meeting, entitled \"1st Moo Party\", for a total of 1,200 fans at the Olympic Park in Seoul. Tickets for the fan meeting sold out within one minute, so the group added an additional meeting for 1,200 more fans the same night. They also held another \"Moo Party\" in Los Angeles, which took place on October 4, 2015. Mamamoo also collaborated and performed with label mate Basick on the Korean rap survival show Show Me the Money.\nOn August 29, 2015, Mamamoo returned to Immortal Song 2 with a rendition of Jo Young-nam's \"Delilah\". On October 31, 2015, Mamamoo returned to the Immortal Song 2, singing a rendition of Korean trot singer Bae Ho's song \"Backwood's Mountain\" (두메산골). Their performance earned their first overall win on Immortal Song with 404 points.\n\n\n=== 2016–2017: Breakthrough and subsequent EPs ===\n\nOn January 10, 2016, RBW announced Mamamoo's first solo concert since their debut in 2014. The concert, titled 2016 Mamamoo Concert-Moosical, was held on August 13–14, 2016, at the Olympic Hall in Seoul. 7,000 tickets for the concert were sold out in one minute.\nOn January 26, 2016, Mamamoo pre-released an R&B ballad, \"I Miss You\", from their first full-length album Melting.

After wrapping up promotions for \"New York\" Mamamoo's agency announced that the group will make their comeback on November 7 with their fourth EP, Memory.

Following the first show of their March 2017 concert in Seoul, Mamamoo received criticism for performing in blackface when, as part of the concert, they played a video containing the members impersonating Bruno Mars while wearing darker makeup, meant to recreate a snippet of the music video for Mars' \"Uptown Funk\" (2014). The clip was cut from following concert dates and multiple apologies were promptly issued, including one directly from the members, stating that they were \"extremely ignorant of blackface and did not understand the implications of our actions. We will be taking time to understand more about our international fans to ensure this never happens again.\" The group released their fifth EP Purple with the lead single \"Yes I Am\" on June 22, 2017. The single quickly climbed to the number one spot on the Melon real-time chart. After one day, Mamamoo set the record for the highest number of unique listeners in 24-hours with \"Yes I Am\" on Melon for a girl group. On June 27, 2017, the song received its first music show win on The Show, followed by wins on Show Champion, M Countdown, and Show! Music Core. Purple also peaked at number one on the Billboard World Albums chart.\n\n\n=== 2018–2019: Widespread recognition, Japanese debut and member solo debuts ===\nOn January 4, 2018, Mamamoo released a pre-release single called \"Paint Me\" to act as a prelude to their upcoming project series \"Four Seasons, Four Colors\". The goal of the series is to showcase four mini albums, each combining one color and a matching member's characteristic for each season. The group has stated that they wish to show their depth as artists and present a more mature style with this project.\n\nMamamoo started off the \"Four Seasons, Four Colors\" project with the release of their sixth EP, Yellow Flower, on March 7. Yellow Flower debuted at number one on the Gaon Album Chart, becoming their first number-one album since their 2014 debut. The Latin-inspired and dance-pop song \"Starry Night\" was released alongside the album, with an accompanying music video. \"Starry Night\" debuted and peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart, earning 44.7 million Gaon Index points in its debut week. It also ranked at number six on the mid-year and 13 on the year-end editions of the Gaon Digital Chart, making it the fourth-highest-charting song by a girl group on the latter.

He reflected on the successes of Mamamoo's participation on Queendom and their second Korean studio album Reality in Black and confirmed that the members would begin to focus on solo projects, with each member hoping to showcase their individualities that they had previously shown in the \"Four Seasons, Four Colors\" project series. Moonbyul became the first member to release a solo project in 2020, releasing her debut EP Dark Side of the Moon on February 14.

The disco-influenced pop song, characterized by themes of isolation and longing in the COVID-19 pandemic, was described by Teen Vogue as a \"fun, chill\" dance track accompanied by a \"striking, retro-inspired music video to match.\" Led by a \"simply melody line and funky vibes,\" the single earned top ten positions in South Korea and on the Billboard World Digital Songs Sales chart, and further charted in Singapore and Japan. The full EP, titled Travel, and its second single, \"Aya\", were released on November 3. Travel received mixed receptions for its lack of cohesion, and it peaked at number two on the Gaon Album Chart. The EP broke the group's personal sales records, selling a reported 100,000 copies in its first day and over 128,000 copies in its first week, and additionally topped iTunes charts in 29 countries. Described as a \"180-degree flip\" from the retro-pop style of \"Dingga,\" the second single from Travel, \"Aya,\" was described by critics as being \"alluring\" and \"captivating\" and peaked within the top 40 of the Gaon Digital Chart.\n\n\n=== 2021–present: Member contract renewals, WAW, Mamamoo+ unit, Mic On, First world tour and 10th debut anniversary ===\nOn January 22, 2021, RBW announced that Solar and Moonbyul had renewed their contracts with their agency, while Wheein and Hwasa were still currently discussing contract renewals.

On July 10, 2006, Chris Daughtry had signed with RCA Records and 19 Recordings, which held contracts with fellow American Idol contestants such as Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken, and among others. Chris Daughtry is a singer-songwriter himself and has collaborated with several other songwriters, such as Live's Ed Kowalczyk, Seether's Shaun Morgan, Goo Goo Dolls's John Rzeznik, Fuel's Carl Bell, 3 Doors Down's Brad Arnold, Matchbox Twenty's Rob Thomas, SR-71's Mitch Allan, Shinedown's Brent Smith, Three Days Grace's Adam Gontier, and the former The Click Five singer Eric Dill, Theory of a Deadman's Tyler Connolly, Lifehouse's Jason Wade and Nickelback's Chad Kroeger.\n\nDaughtry and members of his label held auditions. Ultimately, they chose four members for the band: Jeremy Brady, 21, guitarist (no longer in the band); Josh Steely, 36, lead guitarist; Josh Paul (no longer with the band), 29, bassist who played for Suicidal Tendencies; Joey Barnes, 30, drummer, (no longer with the band). Two of the band members hail from North Carolina – Barnes, whom Chris had known for some time, and Brady, who was introduced to him a month before the audition. Steely and Paul are both from California. The decision was made to name the band \"Daughtry\" in order to keep name recognition. In an interview, Chris Daughtry said, \"We could have come out with a really obscure name, but coming from a TV show and having name recognition, it was easier just to go with my last name.\"\nThe band's self-titled debut album was produced by Howard Benson and was released by RCA Records on November 21, 2006. Chris Daughtry wrote and co-wrote all but two songs on the album – \"Feels Like Tonight\" and \"What About Now\". Other notable songwriters Dr. Luke and Max Martin contributed to the album, and session drummer Josh Freese played on all tracks. However, at the time the album was recorded, Chris was the only official member of the band, leading some to mistakenly believe that the band Daughtry is his solo career.\nDaughtry was an instant success and spawned several hits for the group, starting with its first single \"It's Not Over\", which debuted on the radio on December 6, 2006, after being delayed from a planned September release and reaching number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and hitting the top 3 in several other charts. Shortly thereafter, Jeremy Brady departed and was replaced with Brian Craddock, 31, from Virginia. In interviews, Chris Daughtry and Craddock have discussed having known each other when Chris Daughtry was still a member of Absent Element.\nAfter the success of \"It's Not Over,\" the second single from the album, \"Home\" was released and peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, after debuting at number 83, weeks ahead of its official release to radio. The song was also the official \"kick-off\" song on sixth season of American Idol, played after a contestant was voted off the show, also the case during season five of Australian Idol. The Brazilian version of Idol, called Ídolos Brazil, used this song as well in its second season. The album's third single, \"What I Want\", was released to rock radio on April 23, 2007, featuring musician Slash on lead guitars. The single has peaked at number 6 on the rock charts and is featured as a playable song on Guitar Hero: On Tour for the Nintendo DS. The band's fourth single \"Over You\" was released on July 24, 2007. The band performed this single live on Good Morning America on June 1, 2007.  \"Crashed\", the album's fifth single, was released to rock stations on September 10, 2007, where it was also used in a commercial for Lego Bionicle. The song was also performed on the Pre-Race show on ABC for the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Chevy Rock and Roll 400. The album's sixth single, \"Feels Like Tonight\", was released on January 8, 2008, just over a year after the album's release. The video debuted in January and the song was used for the 2007 WWE Tribute to the Troops. Their song \"There and Back Again\" was also the official theme song for WWE Backlash in 2007.\nDue to the success of the singles, Daughtry was certified 4× Platinum on April 24, 2008. The group was on page 8 on Myspace.com of the most played artists, with over 29 million plays. In addition, the group has appeared on the famous compilation album series Now That's What I Call Music! five times, with their songs \"It's Not Over\", \"Home\", \"Over You\", \"Feels Like Tonight\" and \"What About Now\". The band was also nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2008, for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, Best Rock Album, Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. According to billboard.com, Daughtry has had twenty number one hits around the world.\nA deluxe edition of Daughtry's self-titled album was released on September 9, 2008. Along with the original CD, this expanded CD/DVD package features four bonus tracks, including acoustic versions of \"What About Now,\" \"It's Not Over\", and \"Home\", plus a cover of Foreigner's \"Feels Like the First Time\". The DVD contains all five of Daughtry's music videos, two rarely seen live clips, and exclusive behind-the-scenes tour footage.\nA shortened version of their massive hit single \"Home\" was used at the end of the English League Cup Final in February 2008 when the compilation of Tottenham Hotspur victory over Chelsea was shown at the end of the Sky coverage.\n\n\n=== 2009–2010: Leave This Town ===\nThe second album, Leave This Town was released on July 14, 2009, with fourteen songs making the cut from the nineteen recorded songs.

The record was also number one on the Digital Albums Chart and the Rock Chart.\nAfter Leave This Town was released, Daughtry became the first American Idol artist to have two consecutive number-one albums. Carrie Underwood later achieved this accolade when her albums Carnival Ride (2007) and Play On (2009) went number one.\nDaughtry performed on-stage at the American Music Awards on November 22, 2009, and sang their hit single \"Life After You\".\nOn November 10, 2009, USA Today revealed that Daughtry band members Chris Daughtry and Brian Craddock co-wrote \"Don't Wanna Be Wrong\", an iTunes Deluxe bonus track on Allison Iraheta's debut album, Just Like You.\nOn March 15, 2010, the band released the extended play Leave This Town: The B-Sides with six songs that were not released with the first album.

The split was due to contract fulfillment, wanting to part ways. On the spilt Daughtry said, \"We've always been a rock band. And when you're dealing with a major label, there's always that pressure of needing to turn in hits and needing to cater to a certain format, and I didn't want to do that anymore.\"\nOn November 20, 2019, Chris Daughtry revealed via his Instagram that Daughtry had started to record their sixth studio album and had teamed up with producer Scott Stevens.\nOn December 18, 2019, Chris Daughtry was revealed to be the \"Rottweiler\" in the second season of The Masked Singer.

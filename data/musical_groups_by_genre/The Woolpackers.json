    "text": "The Woolpackers were an English country rock trio of the 1990s, consisting of Steve Halliwell, Billy Hartman and Alun Lewis, all three of whom were stars of the ITV-produced soap opera Emmerdale, in an attempt to cash in on the popularity of line dancing at the time.\nDespite numerous criticisms of their style, the group achieved a hit single with \"Hillbilly Rock Hillbilly Roll\" in November 1996, reaching number 5 on the UK Singles Chart. The parent album Emmer Dance reached number 26 on the UK Albums Chart a few weeks later. A year later, the single \"Line Dance Party\" hit number 25 and their second album The Greatest Line Dancing Party reached number 48 in the UK.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Videography ===\n1996: Emmer Dance, BPI: 2Ã— Platinum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFrank Laufenberg: .

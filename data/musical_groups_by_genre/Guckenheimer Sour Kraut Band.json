    "text": "The Guckenheimer Sour Kraut Band was a humorous musical group of amateur and professional musicians living in the San Francisco Bay Area in California, area who played a repertoire of polkas and light classical music while adopting a persona of mild confusion and wearing self-created uniforms once described as rejects from the Franco-Prussian War. The group originally formed one Christmas season in 1949 to play carols in Sausalito, California, and someone brought a book of polka music, possibly one of the \"Hungry Five\" books by Harry L. Alford whose music became a basic part of the Guckenheimer repertoire. The group became increasingly popular in northern California, often invited to play at wine festivals and openings and in later years for such august occasions as opening night of the San Francisco Symphony and the opera.\nAlthough all were business professionals, the group joined Local 6 of the American Federation of Musicians and became \"professional musicians\" when they were invited by San Francisco Records to make its first record album, \"Oom-Pah-Pah In Hi-Fi\"—described on its front cover as \"The sourest German village band music ever!\" Although the group played for laughs, all its members were quite excellent musicians.\nThe occasional native German-born listener would often remark on the Guckenheimers' similarity to actual village bands back in the old country. The village band sound was authentic enough that RCA Victor signed the group to record a second album, \"Sour Kraut In Hi Fi\" (LPM-1453)\nThe name of the group was taken from an obscure brand of whiskey and adopted by the group's leader, Richard B. Gump, who took on the persona of Herr Doktor Fritz Guckenheimer, Kapellmeister. All of the other band members adopted names that were some variant of Schmidt.\nGump was a San Francisco art dealer and owner of Gump's store in downtown San Francisco, which was also the recording location of their best known record album for RCA Victor Records \"Music For Non-Thinkers\" (LSP/LPM 1721), which was recorded on Sunday, December 29, 1957, in stereo. It was released in 1958. It was re-released on an unknown date, and kept the original stereo catalog number, but adopted a new per-side catalog number as well, J2PY-2451/J2PY-2452.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDr. Fritz Guckenheimer - Director, Arranger, and Vocalist (Richard B. Gump).\nErnst Schmid - Fluegelhorn (Dick Hiatt, a renowned architect; as a young man he played viola in the San Francisco Symphony)\nRudi Schmitt - Trumpet (Robert McDonnell, a fireman with the Southern Pacific Railroad.)\nLudwig Schmitz - Trombone (George \"Cookie\" Conroy, a salesman with Crown-Zellerbach Paper Corp.)\nOtto Schmits - First Clarinet (Robert Entriken, an executive with the Fireman's Fund Insurance Group, later a professor at Golden Gate University.)\nJohann Sebastian Schmidtz III - Second Clarinet and stand in leader when Gump not there(Paul Faria, an interior designer and cabinetmaker and leader of his own professional dance band.)\nHeinrich Schwerdt - Tuba (Bob Kellogg, professional musician and owner of two music stores with his wife Aureba.)\nHugo Schmid - Bass Drum and Cymbal (George Lichty, creator of the nationally famous syndicated newspaper cartoon Grin and Bear It.) Lichty was listed specifically in the Local 6 directory as playing \"Bass Drum and Cymbal\" for he played no other percussion. His was the responsibility for the \"boom-chik-chik\" rhythm of all the waltz-time numbers.\nWolfgang Schwett - Cornet (Dean Coleman, an inspector for the Pacific Fire Rating Bureau and part-time music teacher. He did not appear on the first album.)\nEarlier band members, before the records were made, included Esquire writer Barney Harrold, cabinetmaker George Phoedovius, designer George Ashley and business executive Harry Mohler.\nGeorge Lichty created the cover art for the first two albums, both being comic representations of the band in Lichty's inimitable cartoon style including the \"Gückenheimer Über Alles\" legend on the bass drum. The third album's cover was a photograph of the band, or at least eight members of it as (according to a note on the reverse side) \"Johann Sebastian Schmidtz III was not present -- he overslept.\" There was, however, a ninth character on the cover, as the band was arrayed before a casting of the famous \"The Thinker\" statue by Auguste Rodin on display at the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. The statue, wearing earmuffs, is identified as an \"unmoved sitting bystander.\"\nOn the second album, Gump—or rather, Herr Doktor Guckenheimer—wrote a short note addressed to \"Dear Music-Lovers:\"\n\nOne evening as I wandered along the San Francisco Waterfront, dreaming of my youth and homeland, I heard the dulcet wail of a foghorn rebound off the cliffs that support Telegraph Hill. Here at last, I thought, is the exact timbre-quality of the wald-horn echoing through the rocky crags of my native Bavarian Alps. This nostalgic tone-experience was the inspiration and locale for the record 'Sour Kraut in Hi-Fi' .... a synthesis of Altdeutschbierfestkultur.\n\n\n== Discography and track listings ==\nSan Francisco Records TM-5 \"Oom-Pah-Pah in HiFi\", 1956 (San Francisco Records was later taken over by Barbary Coast Records, which gave it the catalog number BC-33005).\nSide 1\n\nTrink Mir Noch Ä Tröpfche\nGaudeamus\nDie Wacht Am Rhein\nLauterbach\nRain Rain Polka\nPresent Arms\nHi-Le-Hi-Lo\nSchuhplattler Tanze\nSide 2\n\nUnder The Double Eagle\nVilia\nVillage Tavern Polka\nKommt Ein Vogel Geflogen\nBlue Danube\nBier Her, Bier Her\nAlte Kamaraden March\nRCA Victor LP 1453: \"Sour Kraut in Hi-Fi\", 1957\nSide 1\n\nPoet And Peasant Overture\nAch Ich Bin So Müde Polka\nHamburger Waltz\nWarum So Schnell Gallop\nGesellschafts Lieder\nHortensie Polka\nL'Estudiantina\nWien-Wien\nSide 2\n\nTinker Polka\nSkater's Waltz\nSobra Las Olas\nSpringtime Polka\nWiener Blut\nTyroler Walzer\nDer Lustige Musikant Polka\nDrink Mein Liebling\nRCA Victor also made a 45 rpm Extended Play version of Sour Kraut In Hi-Fi (EPS 1-1453) which has four selections:\n\nWien-Wien\nWiener Blut\nDer Lustige Musikant Polka\nDrink Mein Liebling\nRCA Victor LPM-1721: \"Music For Non-Thinkers\", 1958\nSide 1\n\nSecond Hungarian Rhapsody\nGrad Aus Dem Wirthaus\nKatarina Polka\nIn München Steht Ein Hofbrau Haus\nJägermarsch\nUm Die Ecke Rum\nIn Der Heimat Da Gibt's Ein Wiederseh'n\nStars And Striped Forever\nSide 2\n\nRaymond Overture\nKommes Ein Birdie Yet\nTrinklieder\nGruss Aus Minneapolis\nDer Kuss (II Bacio)\nMädel Wasch Dich\nRheinwein Polka\nCome Vere The Band Ist Playing\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLiner notes—Oom-Pah-Pah In Hi Fi\nLiner notes—Sour Kraut in Hi-Fi\nLiner Notes—Music For Non Thinkers\n\n\n== External links ==\nGuckenheimer Sour Kraut site"

    "text": "ViVii is a Swedish indie-pop trio, self-described as a \"music project based in Stockholm\". ViVii is composed of married couple Emil and Caroline Jonsson, alongside Anders Eckborn. “Siv (You and I),” their debut single, is accompanied by a video made through home recordings and disposable cameras. On March 15, 2019, the band released their debut eponymous album. The album has been characterized as \"fluttering ethereal indie-pop,\" and \"reminiscent of Belle and Sebastian in its penchant for fairytale-esque storytelling and Lykke Li in its superb use of vocal harmonies.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\nhttps://viviiofficial.com/\nhttps://schedule.sxsw.com/2022/artists/2054882\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/21m5PZPUgSF0k76W1MMCAa"

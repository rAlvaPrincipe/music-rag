    "text": "Big Nuz was a South African Kwaito trio from Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, founded in 2002. The group was composed of three members known by their stage names Mampintsha, R Mashesha, and Danger.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2003–2006: Early years ===\nThe founding members grew up together in the township of Umlazi. The naming of the group was inspired by \"NUZ\", which is the number plate or licence plate prefix for all vehicles registered in Umlazi. The group  consisted of three members: Mandla Maphumulo (a.k.a. Mampintsha) deceased [2022.12.24], Mzi (a.k.a. Danger) and Sbu (a.k.a. Mashesha) deceased [2015] and was formed in 2002 when they moved from Durban to Johannesburg to secure a recording contract. In 2002, they performed a jingle Backstage on e.tv. With little success in securing a recording contract, the group collaborated with Koloi Lebone and Beatmaker recording songs that have not been released. In 2004, another collaboration with Kwaito artist Ishmael featured them in the song \"Boom Boom\". In 2006, the group secured a recording contract with Gallo Records and released their debut  album titled  Zozo in collaboration with Kid Mokoena of Why Not Entertainment. The album did poorly and Gallo Records was criticised for poor management.\n\n\n=== (2007–2008): 2nd round Knockout ===\nIn 2007, the group returned to Durban to work with DJ Tira to record and release the track \"Uyoysholo Wena\".  In 2008, the group signed with the Afrotainment recording label and released their second studio  album 2nd Round Knockout. The album was a commercial success selling over 20,000 copies in South Africa with the single \"Ubala\" seeing substantially more airtime. The track was nominated for Song of The Year at the 2008 South African Music Awards where the group also performed during the opening ceremonies. In 2008, \"2nd Round Knockout\" won the Metro FM Best Kwaito Award and was nominated at the 2008 Channel O Awards. The group continued to work on other projects such as the theme songs for KZN Department of transport and Nedbank Cup. In 2009, they performed at President Jacob Zuma's Inauguration.\n\n\n=== (2009–2010): Undisputed ===\nIn the winter of 2009 the group returned to the studio to record their third studio album titled Undisputed, in collaboration with DJ Fisherman and DJ Tira. The album features the song \"Umlilo\" which received the Song of The Year Award from the South African Music Awards. The album also received the award for best album. Other hit singles included \"Newlands West\" & \"Siyagijima\". The album went Platinum. \n\n\n=== (2011–2012): Pound For Pound ===\nIn August 2011, the group released their fourth studio album Pound for Pound. The album is a two disc album with 25 songs.

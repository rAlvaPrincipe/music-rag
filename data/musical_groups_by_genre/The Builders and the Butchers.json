    "text": "The Builders and The Butchers are a folk rock band based in Portland, Oregon, United States. It is fronted by singer/guitar player Ryan Sollee. The other members of the band are Willy Kunkle (bass guitar, vocals, percussion), Justin Baier (drums, backup vocals, percussion), Ray Rude (drums, piano, clarinet, backup vocals, percussion), and Harvey Tumbleson (mandolin, banjo, guitar, vocals, percussion).\nThe band's debut self-titled album was released in 2007 by Bladen County Records.\nTo date, the band has 6 full-length albums, 2 live album and 2 EP splits.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Builders and The Butchers formed on October 31, 2005. They came together because \"a lot of bands were all breaking up around the same time, and we were looking to get into something new—so it just worked out.\" \nEach member is originally from Anchorage, Alaska and migrated separately to Portland, Oregon to start a career in music. \nInitially they called themselves \"The Funeral Band\", performing in the streets and outside of music venues. The name eventually changed to The Builders and The Butchers, \"for no other reason than it was the only name all five members liked.\" The first year of acoustic performances were mostly street shows until opening for the experimental band Man Man in 2006. \"We very slowly started plugging [our instruments] in.\" Sollee says, but the group had to figure out how to use its two percussionists on stage. They found that by splitting one drum kit between Seely and Rude, with one handling the kick drum and another playing the snare, they developed what the group calls a \"deconstructed\" drumming style. \nThe band's song-writing process involves Sollee writing the lyrics out and presenting it to the other members, who then start playing and putting the music around these lyrics.\nIn May 2008 the band won the Willamette Week's \"Best New Band of 2008\" and Seattle Sound’s “Best Live Performers 2008”.\nIn late 2010, The Builders and the Butchers signed with Badman Recording Co. and released their third album, Dead Reckoning on February 22, 2011.\n\n\n== Artwork ==\nThe Builders and The Butchers' album artwork is produced by Portland, Oregon artist Lukas Ketner.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nJustin Baier (drums, backup vocals, percussion)\nWilly Kunkle (bass guitar, vocals, percussion)\nRay Rude (drums, piano, clarinet, backup vocals, percussion)\nRyan Sollee (lead vocals, guitar, percussion)\nHarvey Tumbleson (mandolin, banjo, guitar, vocals, percussion)\n\n\n=== Former ===\nAlex Ellis (bass guitar, vocals, percussion) – \"The Builders and The Butchers\", \"Loch Lomond/The Builders and The Butchers\" 12-inch Split, \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\",\"Dead Reckoning\"\nBrandon Hafer (drums, trumpet, melodica, backup vocals, percussion)\nAdrienne Hatkin (mandolin, banjo, accordion, vocals, percussion) – live shows\nPaul Seely (drums, trumpet, melodica, backup vocals, percussion) – \"The Builders and The Butchers\", \"Loch Lomond/The Builders and The Butchers\" 12-inch Split, \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\n\n\n=== Guests ===\nAnnalisa Tornfelt (violin, backup vocals) for \"The Builders and The Butchers\", \"Loch Lomond/The Builders and The Butchers\" 12-inch Split, \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nEmily Tornfelt (cello) for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nTyler Tornfelt (cello) for \"Loch Lomond/The Builders and The Butchers\" 12-inch Split\nSkip Von Kuske (cello) for \"Loch Lomond/The Builders and The Butchers\" 12-inch Split\nDouglas Jenkins (cello) for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nJustin Kagen (cello) for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nJoe Bowden (backup vocals) for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nSean Flynn (backup vocals) for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nJesse Bettis (backup vocals) for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nScott Magee (bass clarinet, backup vocals) for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nSebastian Bibb Barrett (trumpet) for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nVictor Nash (trumpet, french horn) for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nAmanda Lawrence (viola) for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nChris Funk ([backup vocals]) for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nMike Anzalone (castanets, backup vocals)for \"Loch Lomond/The Builders and The Butchers\" 12-inch Split, \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nThe Flash Choir for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nThe Gospel Choir for \"Salvation is a Deep Dark Well\"\nThe Portland Cello Project – live shows\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial The Builders and The Butchers Site·"

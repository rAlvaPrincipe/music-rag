    "text": "Fast Life Yungstaz (also known by its acronym F.L.Y.) is an American hip hop group from Stone Mountain, Georgia. The group is composed of Myko McFly, Vee and Mook.  The group's debut album, Jamboree, was released on June 23, 2009.\nFast Life Yungstaz, commonly abbreviated as F.L.Y., is a hip-hop trio hailing from East Atlanta. They are recognized for their contribution to the 'futuristic swag' subgenre, an innovative fusion of trap rap, snap music, and elements of rock. This genre, characterized by its melodious approach, also features artists such as Roscoe Dash, Travis Porter, Rich Kidz, J. Futuristic (previously known as J. Money), and Yung L.A. Their era was marked by the creation of some of the most exuberant and unapologetically spirited tracks in hip-hop's history.\n\"Swag Surfin\" has evolved beyond a song to become a widely embraced dance movement, growing in popularity as time progresses. It holds a special place within the black community and has been recognized as one of the most iconic group dances in 21st-century black culture. The dance embodies a sense of unity and collective experience, requiring participants to link up in a close, family-like connection, moving in unison and symbolizing togetherness in life's journey.\nThe dance is a staple at celebratory gatherings, often serving as a ritualistic beginning that establishes the vibe for events. It's a common sight at homecoming yard celebrations at HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), as well as at weddings, graduations, and parties, where it's known to elevate the excitement and energy.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n2010: Mile Hi Club (hosted by DJ Pretty Boy Tank and DJ Geronimo)\n2010: Auto-Pilot (hosted by DJ Pretty Boy Tank)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

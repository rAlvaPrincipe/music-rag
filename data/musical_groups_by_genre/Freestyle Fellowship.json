    "text": "Freestyle Fellowship is an American hip hop group from Los Angeles, California. It consists of Aceyalone, Myka 9, P.E.A.C.E., and Self Jupiter. The group was a prominent part of the Good Life Cafe collective, and are part of the Project Blowed collective.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhile in high school in the late 1980s, Aceyalone, Myka 9, and Self Jupiter formed the short-lived MC Aces, a precursor to Freestyle Fellowship, at the Good Life Cafe in Los Angeles, California. Subsequently, former high school friend P.E.A.C.E. was added to form Freestyle Fellowship.\nFreestyle Fellowship released the debut studio album, To Whom It May Concern..., in 1991. In 1993, the group released the second studio album, Innercity Griots.\nFreestyle Fellowship went on hiatus due to the incarceration of Self Jupiter. In 1998, the group reunited to record the Shockadoom EP, which would be released in 2002. The group released Temptations in 2001, and The Promise in 2011.\n\n\n== Style and influences ==\n\nAccording to Los Angeles Times, Freestyle Fellowship incorporates \"jazz rhythms into its raps, which have the improvisational ebb and flow and the random explosiveness of a jazz solo.\" In a 1993 interview with Los Angeles Times, the group's member Myka 9 said, \"What we are is liberators, liberating rap from its R&B/funk structures--that 4/4 (time) prison.\"\nThe group has been described by LA Weekly as \"the astral jazz-cracked geniuses of sherm-strafed South Central, rapping with caged bird cadences about sleeping on park benches, biblical books, and gangsta rap carpetbaggers.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nTo Whom It May Concern...

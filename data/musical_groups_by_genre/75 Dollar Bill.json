    "text": "75 Dollar Bill is a musical duo formed in New York City in 2012. Its members are Che Chen (guitar), formerly of True Primes, and Rick Brown (drums), formerly of V-Effect and Curlew. Sasha Frere-Jones described their music as displaying \"a certain kind of formal fullness and technical freedom,\" which he said has helped introduce jazz to a new generation. Other critics have noted that their music shows signs of Mauritanian influences, because Chen studied Moorish music in Mauritania with Jheich Ould Chighaly in 2013. Their first full-length album, Wooden Bag, was released in 2015 by Other Music Recording Company. Their second album, Wood/Metal/Plastic/Pattern/Rhythm/Rock, was released in 2016 on the Los Angeles-based label Thin Wrist.\nFor their 2019 album, I Was Real, they expanded to a larger ensemble of players, which the Guardian described as \"adding yet more depth to their placeless, gripping grooves\". The Wire named I Was Real the number one album on their year end list for 2019.  Since then they have self-released a series of live recordings through Bandcamp, including Power Failures and the Social Music at Troost series.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nWooden Bag (2015, Other Music)\nWood/Metal/Plastic/Pattern/Rhythm/Rock  (2016, Thin Wrist)\nI Was Real (2019, Thin Wrist)\nLive at Tubby's (2020, Grapefruit)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBandcamp"

    "text": "Wapstan (misspelling of the cree word Wapistan meaning 'Marten') is the name of the main musical project of Canadian noise musician Martin Sasseville (born 1980) based in Montreal, Quebec. Originally formed in Saguenay as a project to create experimental sounds influenced by the experience of coldness, Wapstan based most of his sounds as a tribute of the north. The Wapstan sound is often self-described as \"hypothermic drones\". Wapstan's sound was originally constructed as a vitalist ambiance opposed to the general pessimism of the noise scene. Since its moving to Montreal in 2003, Wapstan started performing live and has performed many shows in Montreal as well as New England and central Canada.\nMost Wapstan releases are on its own record label Brise-Cul Records under the CD-R format. The record label is also mainly focused on releasing similar-sounding artists as well as many Montreal artists such as Kvik, Grkzgl, Gmackrr, Midwifery, Les Temps Liquides, Monday Morning Erection, Dead Bush and many others.\n\n\n== Partial discography ==\nL’ivresse et le froid (Brise-Cul, 2004)\nL’appel du Vent (Audiobot, 2005)\nTrompe la mort (X Died En Route Y, 2005)\nWaiting For Winter (Brise-Cul, 2005)\nVingt-Cinq (Brise-Cul, Québec, 2005)\nTranscending Hypothermia (Brise-Cul, 2006)\nHans Island (Knife In The Toaster, 2006)\nIl Fait Froid, Je Sais Que C’est Froid (Nurse Etiquette, 2006)\nOf Zero And The Void (Run Down Sun, 2006)\nThunder On The Tundra(Landscape Sounds to Scare Gods) (Pasalymany Tapes, 2006)\nWolfuck (Brise-Cul, 2007)\nSaturnales (INYRDISK, 2007)\nThe Gallery (Brise-Cul, 2007)\nDistant Thunder (Chondritic Sounds, 2008)\nStoneham (Brise-Cul, 2010)\nMonolith Thunder (Brise-Cul, 2010)\nWinter is War (Brise-Cul, 2010)\nOld Age (Brise-Cul, 2010)\nWapstan also have done split with many underground artists such as Envenomist, Pon De Replay, Grkzgl, Kapali Carsi, Rei Rea, Robe., Seplophobia, Never Presence Forever, Crotch, Hebeeb...\n\n\n== External links ==\nBrise-Cul Records"

The strange story of the movie took place in apartments and rooms showing similarity with the band's history, which was born in Andrew J's living-room. That is where their first songs were written and the musicians create a band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nTheir debut album, Enter, was released in the second half of 2010 by their own label LAB6 in Hungary and by Whereabouts Records in Japan. At this time and during the following tour, Zsolt Kaltenecker was also a member of Bin-Jip.

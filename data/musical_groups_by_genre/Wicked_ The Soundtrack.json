    "text": "Wicked: The Soundtrack is the soundtrack album to the 2024 epic musical fantasy film Wicked by Jon M. Chu, the first of the two-part film adaptation of the stage musical of the same name by Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman. It was released by Republic Records and Verve Records on November 22, 2024, the same date as the film's theatrical release in the United States. Along with the film cast, the soundtrack is billed to Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the film's two main stars, who each appear on seven tracks out of eleven on the standard release.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe soundtrack album comprises 11 songs from the film, with all songs from the first act of the original stage musical being included. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, who play Elphaba and Glinda, respectively, each appear on seven songs. The majority of the vocals were recorded live on set, rather than in a recording studio.\nIt was produced by Wicked composer Stephen Schwartz, Greg Wells, and Stephen Oremus, and was mixed by Wells. All songs were orchestrated by Jeff Atmajian. Mike Knobloch, President of Music and Publishing at NBCUniversal, stated that Schwartz, Wells, Oremus, and the production team wanted the album to be \"a standalone and complete aural experience\" from the film itself. He further stated:\n\nThe original cast recording is iconic, so priority number one was to not mess it up. It has also been a great opportunity to make a soundtrack for a beloved musical that will only be the second Wicked album in two decades. But while our primary mission was to make the film, we didn't want the soundtrack to simply be a 'copied and pasted' byproduct.\"\n\n\n== Production ==\nWork on the soundtrack began early in the film's pre-production process, as the musical numbers would largely drive production. The process began by developing the songs' instrumental tracks and recording demos in phases. The film employed a large orchestra, in contrast to the smaller pit orchestras used in Broadway productions. Schwartz stated, \"There's this huge, magical world that Jon Chu has created and the music needed to have the size to occupy that world. . . .Songs needed to be adjusted based on the action we're seeing on the screen. In some cases, things were expanded.\"\nCast vocals were recorded throughout filming, which required the work of sound engineer Simon Hayes, who worked as a live sound mixer. Each actor was equipped with three microphones: one boom mic and two lavalier microphones. They were also fitted with in-ear monitors that would play the finished studio backing tracks or a live keyboard. When certain filming restrictions did not allow the actors to sing the entire piece live, their live performances were intercut with their pre-recorded studio vocals. Schwartz stated, \"The way their voices sounded in the recording studio needed to match how they sounded when they were on a soundstage, and that was tricky. We had a strong technical team and we were very aware going in that we were going to mix and match.\"\n\n\n=== Musical numbers ===\n\n\"Popular\" was the first musical number shot for the film. Schwartz, Wells, and Oremus proposed modifying its rhythm from the stage musical version and \"hip-hop[ping] it up a little bit\", but Grande insisted that the song stay true to the original. The song features an extended ending with additional key changes.\nIn the song \"One Short Day\", Schwartz wrote a new section \"to show more of the propaganda that the Wizard was disseminating and really understand better this magic book — the Grimmerie\". The new section was performed by Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, who originated the roles of Elphaba and Glinda on Broadway, respectively.\nThe \"Defying Gravity\" sequence was filmed about a year into production, having been delayed by the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Erivo stated that she wanted the character's voice to grow throughout the song. When recording rehearsal tracks of the song, Erivo first sang the ending battle cry \"by the book\" before Schwartz encouraged her to try different variations. She stated, \"I was always looking forward to that moment, just because everything builds to there. Your body and your brain and your mind – and your heart, really – are waiting to be able to release that one final note, because it's the ultimate moment where [Elphaba] can become herself.\"\n\"Ozdust Duet\", a new orchestral track, is included as a bonus track on digital versions of the album. It combines elements from \"Dancing Through Life\" and \"For Good\", the latter of which is expected to be included in the second film.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe soundtrack album was released on November 22, 2024. In addition to digital download and streaming, it was also released on CD, LP, and picture disc. Exclusive variants of the CD and LP were released at Target and Barnes & Noble. Upon its release, soundtrack album listening parties were held at music stores throughout the United States from November 22 to 24, 2024.\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nOn November 21, 2024, Hits Daily Double reported that \"Popular\" and \"Defying Gravity\" were expected to be released as singles. \"Popular\" made its radio debut in the United States on November 22, 2024, the same date as the film and soundtrack's release, as the album's mainstream radio single.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nWicked: The Soundtrack became the most-streamed musical soundtrack on Amazon Music within the first 24 hours of its release. Within the first three days of its release, \"Defying Gravity\" had been streamed on Spotify 4.9 million times; \"Popular\" followed suit with 4.6 million streams.\nIn the U.S., the album debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 with 139,000 album-equivalent units, and topped the Top Album Sales chart with 85,000 sales. It marks the highest debut for a soundtrack of a musical stage-to-film adaptation. In addition, the album topped the Top Soundtracks and Vinyl Albums charts.

In addition to commending the vocal performances of Erivo and Grande, Billboard's Stephen Daw praised the updated \"poppy\" orchestration and vocals provided by Jonathan Bailey in \"Dancing Through Life\", noting that it is a particular improvement from its original Broadway cast recording counterpart.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\nNotes\n\nCommentary by Schwartz is included as an additional track on the Apple Music edition of the album.\nTruncated versions of \"Popular\" and \"Defying Gravity\" that omit dialogue appear as additional tracks on certain digital editions of the album.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAll music is composed by Stephen Schwartz.\n\n\n=== Musicians ===\n\n\n=== Vocalists ===\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWicked: The Soundtrack at AllMusic \nWicked: The Soundtrack at Discogs"

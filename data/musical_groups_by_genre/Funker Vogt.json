    "text": "Funker Vogt (German: [ˈfʊŋkɐ ˈfoːkt]) is a German electronic-industrial music project with an aggressive style, formed by vocalist Jens Kästel and programmer Gerrit Thomas in 1995. Other members of the band are keyboardist/manager Björn Böttcher, live guitarist Frank Schweigert and lyricist Kai Schmidt.  The name of the band translates from German to English as \"Radio Operator Vogt\", this being the surname of a friend of the band who was a military radio operator.\nThe band ceased in the summer of 2021 due to the termination of cooperation with Chris L.[1] [2]\nOn January 1 2023 Funker Vogt announced that they would return.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group appeared on several German compilations and, in 1996, released their debut album Thanks for Nothing. Following the release of two limited edition EPs (Words of Power and Take Care), Funker Vogt signed with the American record label Metropolis Records. Metropolis re-released Thanks for Nothing, followed by the We Came to Kill in late 1997. Kästel and Thomas have participated, as remixers, on Leæther Strip album Yes, I'm Limited, Vol. 2. In 2000, Funker Vogt released Maschine Zeit, followed by the remix EP T in early 2001. Additionally to the core members of the band, concert members also include Björn Böttcher (keyboard) and Frank Schweigert (guitar, he replaced Thomas Kroll in 2004). Kai Schmidt writes most of the lyrics and manages the band through his own management company. They all hail from the town of Hamelin in Germany. The majority of their lyrics revolve around the concepts of war.\nA distinctive theme is present in the band's work and stage presence; both their musicianship and their costuming are strongly reminiscent of military music and dress. This military aesthetic is also popular with the band's fanbase. However, the political stance of Funker Vogt is decidedly anti-war; the band cites \"war and social injustice\" as their primary topics of discussion, noting that the goal of the album Execution Tracks, along with the accompanying video, was to \"present the grotesque cruelties and the tragedy of war.\"\nAccording to the band's website, as of 2011 both Björn Böttcher and Kai Schmidt are no longer collaborating with the band. As a result, Funker Vogt will no longer be managed by REPOMANagement. In 2013, longtime frontman Jens Kästel left the band after his last show on 30 November in Berlin. Four years later in 2017 Funker Vogt reformed with a new singer, Chris L. (Agonoize/The Sexorcist).\n\n\n=== The Hero Trilogy ===\nSee the main article: The Hero Trilogy\nWith the release of Blutzoll, Funker Vogt have completed their 'Hero Trilogy'. It began with Tragic Hero on the album Execution Tracks, continued with Fallen Hero from Navigator, and was concluded in 2010 with Arising Hero. All three parts of the trilogy were released as promotional singles.\n\n\n== Members ==\nBastian Polak – vocals\nGerrit Thomas – programming\nRené Dornbusch – keyboards, drums\nThomas is also in Ravenous, Fusspils 11 and Fictional, and produced a project released in 2012 by Gecko Sector.

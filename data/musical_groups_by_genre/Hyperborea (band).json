Since 2002, they have focused on Finnish traditional tunes. The lyrics of their song \"Viikoksi viriä mieli\" (from Perinnearkku) follow a similar rhythmic pattern to the great Finnish epic Kalevala (although this pattern cannot be exactly replicated in English).\nHyperborea were the 2006 band of the year at the Kaustinen Folk Music Festival held annually in the small community of Kaustinen, Central Ostrobothnia, Finland.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFinnish music\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)"

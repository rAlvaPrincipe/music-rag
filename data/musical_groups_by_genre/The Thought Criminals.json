    "text": "The Thought Criminals is a London, England-based electronic band, formed by Kirlian Blue (synths, backing vocals) and Rocky Goode (vocals, lyrics) in 2004. Their debut album was Die Young : Stay Pretty (2008, WTII Records), made with dance producer Tony Messenger and mixer Rob Henry of  Children of The Bong. Their last release was the Alnum  \"You're A Moral Liability !\" (19 November 2018, WTII Records). \"The Thought Criminals conjure early 80's style electropop in the vein of, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Soft Cell, New Order, Gary Numan, OMD, etc\". \"The band’s sound contains audible traces of Gary Numan, Tik and Tok, Nine Inch Nails and a gorgeously dark sense of humour which will leave a little smile on your face.\" \"Take one part Numan-esque glamour, one part Soft Cell'ish sleaze and sultriness and one part Prodigy inspired punk rock and you'll still be nowhere close to describing the hyper-kinetik sound of London's self-proclaimed electro-sluts.\"\n\n\n== Official releases ==\nYou're A Moral Liability !

    "text": "Whirlpool Productions is a German house music project formed in 1991 from Cologne, consisting of musicians and producers Eric D. Clark, Justus KÃ¶hncke and Hans Nieswandt.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\nWhirlpool Productions are known for their unique, experimental sound that shaped the style of bands like Sensorama or Egoexpress. Their disco hit \"From Disco to Disco\" was a big success. In summer 1997, it was a number 1 for 9 weeks in Italy. The musicians were also journalists in the old editorial staff of Spex music magazine, and therefore were also interested in the theoretical side of their activity. Today, they appear mostly as DJs. Hans Nieswandt talks in his book Plus Minus Acht about his memories of house in the '90s.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nBrian de Palma (1995)\nDense Music (1996)\n???

The initiator and the first leader of the choir was Hryhoriy Veryovka, researcher and choir conductor. The choir represented Ukrainian art in the cities of the USSR, Romania (1952, 1956), Poland (1953), Finland (1954), Belgium and Luxembourg (1958), Germany (1959), Yugoslavia (1962) and other countries. In honor of its founder, the choir was named after him in 1965. In the same year, the team was headed by Anatoly Avdievsky. In 1965 the choir was awarded the title \"deserved\", in 1974 the title \"academic\" was granted and in 1997 granted the status of \"national\".\nThe repertoire of the ensemble is based on Ukrainian folklore, songs and dances of other nations. In Soviet period songs devoted to Communist party also were present in their repertoire. In 2011, remarkable was a premiere performance of the folk-opera \"When the fern blooms\" by Yevhen Stankovych, forbidden in Soviet time. The ensemble  consists of 158 people including not only singers but also orchestral and choreographic groups.\nSince Avdievsky's death in 2016, the leader of the ensemble has been Zenoviy Korinets.\nThe Veryovka Choir has toured in Mexico, Canada, France, Switzerland, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, The United States and a number of other countries, and has traditionally participated in major Ukrainian state events.

The incident sparked public anger. Later, Volodymyr Borodyanski, minister of culture of Ukraine apologized to Hontareva and stated that “the law does not prohibit moral perversions”.\nThe 2022 Pink Floyd single \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" opens with a sample from a recording by the choir of the 1914 anthem \"Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow\" (Ukrainian: Ой у лузі червона калина) by the choir.\n\n\n== Members ==\nYevchenko Kasyan a Ukrainian musician joined the choir in 1950.\nSinger Alla Kudlai joined the choir in 1978.\nIn March 2022, member Hennadiy Pavlyk died.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial page\nVeryovka Ukrainian Folk Choir discography at Discogs"

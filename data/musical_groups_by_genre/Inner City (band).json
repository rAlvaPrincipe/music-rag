    "text": "Inner City is an American electronic music group that formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1987. The group was originally composed of the record producer and composer Kevin Saunderson (born September 5, 1964) and the Chicago, Illinois, vocalist Paris Grey (born November 5, 1965). Saunderson is renowned as one of the Belleville Three—along with Juan Atkins and Derrick May—high school friends who later originated the Detroit techno sound. In February 2018, Billboard magazine ranked them as the 69th most successful dance artists of all-time.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\nInner City topped the US Billboard dance chart five times, and had nine top 40 hits on the UK Singles Chart. The group is best known for its early dancefloor-pop music crossover tracks \"Big Fun\" (UK #8, US Dance #1) and \"Good Life\" (UK #4, US Dance #1). Other hits include \"Do You Love What You Feel\" (UK #16, US Dance #1) and \"Whatcha Gonna Do with My Lovin'\" (UK #12, US Dance #8). The music videos to these songs received significant airplay throughout the world. Later work introduced a hybrid of techno, jazz and swing beats with a more soulful sound in the vein of downtempo British groups such as Soul II Soul and Massive Attack.  The group recorded three albums for Virgin/EMI Records and two singles for Columbia/SME Records.\nIn the early nineties, Tommy Onyx was brought on to be the band leader for Inner City live shows. Onyx co wrote the hits “Hallelujah”, “Fire” & “Bad Girl” and produced the Spanish language version of  Good Life, “Buena Vida”.\nIn 2017, a new incarnation of the group was formed with Kevin Saunderson's youngest son Dantiez joining as a permanent fixture. Dantiez and Kevin’s first single as Inner City, “Good Luck”, was released April 14, 2017 on KMS. “Good Luck” features vocals from LaRae Starr and includes remixes from DEAS, Sure Is Pure and Chuck Daniels. In 2018, Steffanie Christi’an was added as vocalist.\nIn 2020, the Saundersons (Kevin and his son Dantiez) released a new Inner City album with Christi'an as the main vocalist. Called We All Move Together, the title track which featured a spoken word performance from actor Idris Elba. Elba also featured on the single \"No More Looking Back\", which was the first Inner City project to be released by Defected Records, a British independent record label specialising in house music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\nA Album was released as Big Fun in North America.\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Articles, Interviews & Reviews ==\n\"Inner City — We All Move Together\", Ben Cardew, Medium, Sep 9, 2020\n\"Kevin Saunderson: “Black people don’t even know that techno came from Black artists”Jaguar talks to Kevin Saunderson and Idris Elba about their Inner City collaboration, the roots of techno and the future of dance music\" jaguea, Mixmag, 22 October 2020\n\"How we made Good Life: Paris Grey and Kevin Saunderson on Inner City's house classic\" interview by Interviews by Dave Simpson, The Guardian, Tue 6 Aug 2019\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one dance hits (United States)\nList of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chart\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAllMusic guide about Inner City\nInner City's MySpace Fan Page\nInner City Discogs\nInner City on AllMusic (Inner City's top tracks, abums & reviews)\nKevin Saunderson on AllMusic (member of Inner City, Reese & Santonio)"

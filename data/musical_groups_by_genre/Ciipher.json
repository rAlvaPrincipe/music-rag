Originally a seven-piece ensemble, members Tan, Tag, Dohwan, and Won left the group on August 9, 2023.

About selecting the members for the first group signed under his R.A.I.N company, Rain said, \"There were a lot of factors involved in the process of making Ciipher, but when I met these kids, I felt like I could bet it all on them. Not just my time or my skill, but all the things I had and have made. Whether the group has good results or not, I don't think I'll regret the things that I gave to this group. That's how talented and well-mannered they are\".\nPrior to joining the group, many of the members had auditioned on popular television programs or trained at other major labels. In December 2014, Tan competed in Mnet's survival reality show No.Mercy under his birth name Choi Seok-won. However, he did not make it into the final lineup of Monsta X in 2015.

    "text": "Fess Williams and his Royal Flush Orchestra was the main band of clarinetist Fess Williams from 1926â€“1930\n\n\n== Brief history ==\nIn 1926 Williams formed the Royal Flush Orchestra.  The popular hot jazz outfit held residency at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom for most of its life and recorded on the Victor, Vocalion, Gennett, Okeh, Brunswick, Champion, and Harmony labels. Williams, Frank Marvin, and Perry Smith supplied vocals.  The flamboyant Williams typically performed wearing a white suit and top hat.\nIn 1928 Williams traveled to Chicago where he temporarily fronted Dave Peyton's band at the Regal Theatre.  Calling the group Fess Williams and His Joy Boys, he recorded two sides with them for Vocalion.  The Royal Flush Orchestra continued to operate in his absence, and in 1929 he returned to New York to resume his duties.\nThe Royal Flush Orchestra recorded its last side in 1930.\n\n\n== Orchestra members ==\nRalph Bedell \t        - Drums\nOllie Blackwell       - Banjo\nRalph Brown \t        - Alto Saxophone\nEmanuel Casamore \t- Tuba\nEmanuel Clark \t- Trumpet\nHenry Duncan \t        - Piano\nFelix Gregory \t- Clarinet, Alto Saxophone, Tenor Saxophone\nBobby Holmes \t        - Clarinet, Alto Saxophone\nDavid \"Jelly\" James \t- Trombone\nLockwood Lewis \t- Clarinet, Alto Saxophone\nFrank Marvin \t        - Vocals\nOtto Mikell \t        - Clarinet, Alto Saxophone\nAndy Pendleton \t- Banjo\nWalter \"Fats\" Pichon \t- Piano\nKenneth Roane \t- Trumpet\nPerry Smith \t        - Clarinet, Tenor Saxophone, Vocals\nGeorge Temple \t- Trumpet\nClinton Walker \t- Tuba\nProfessor Stanley Williams \t- Alto Saxophone, Clarinet, Vocals, Leader\n\n\n== Selected recordings ==\nHot Town\nFriction listen to recording, via YouTube\nHere 'Tis\n\n\n== External links ==\nFess Williams at Red Hot Jazz Archive"

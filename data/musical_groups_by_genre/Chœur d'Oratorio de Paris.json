It then recorded the work as part of a complete discography of the nine symphonies, published in December 2006 by Ambroisie.\nThe choir also performs annually under Sourisse's direction, works such as Liszt's Missa Choralis, Ein deutsches Requiem by Brahms, the Requiem by Alfred Desenclos, Duruflé's Requiem, Bach's Mass in B minor, Mendelssohn's Psalms, Jean-Joseph de Mondonville's Grand motet, and Marc Antoine Charpentier's Grand motet.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\n2006: Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 (as part of Beethoven's complete symphonies, Chœur d’oratorio de Paris.

    "text": "Alter Ego is a German music group comprising Roman Flügel and Jörn Elling Wuttke. They achieved notability in 2004 with their track \"Rocker\", which became one of the year's defining dance anthems, especially in Europe, and getting played on rotation amongst the most popular DJs such as Felix Da Housecat, 2 Many DJs and The Chemical Brothers. The track peaked at #32 in the UK Singles Chart.\nIn the 2004 Groove Magazine Readers Poll, Alter Ego won three categories, taking out the award for 'Best Single' for \"Rocker\", 'Best Album' for Transphormer, and also 'Best Live Act'. French group Black Strobe took out 'Best Remix' honours with their remix of \"Rocker\".\nThough the two remain friends, Alter Ego have not been active since the release of their final album in 2008. In interviews, Flügel suggested that the hiatus occurred because the two simply stopped enjoying working professionally, and following their own projects was the best way of both securing their friendship and keeping their work interesting.\nIn 2005, Roman Flügel went on to produce the track \"Gehts Noch?\", which was a worldwide hit, and was regularly played by many international DJs. Since Alter Ego became inactive, Flügel signed to Dial Records and released three full length solo albums so far, along with several EPs released on various other labels and collaborations with like-minded artists such as Simian Mobile Disco and Daniel Avery, who count Flügel's work as inspirations. In contrast to the harsh, electro-house style that made \"Rocker\" and \"Gehts Noch?\" successful, Flügel's recent work is inspired chiefly by techno and krautrock.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nAlter Ego (1994)\nAlterism (1996) (remix album)\nDecoding the Hacker Myth (1996)\nTransphormer (2004)\nTransphormed (2005) (remix album)\nWhy Not?!

    "text": "The Refugees are an American folk trio composed of three members: Wendy Waldman, Cidny Bullens, and Deborah Holland. They have released two albums, Unbound (2009) and Three (2012), both on Wabuho Records.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGrammy-nominated singer-songwriters Wendy Waldman, Cidny Bullens, and Deborah Holland had performed extensively in separate group projects and as solo artists before forming the Refugees in 2007. They released their debut album, Unbound, on Wabuho Records in 2009. Guitar Player magazine described Unbound as \"a rootsy outing replete with catchy arrangements and sparkling three-part vocal harmonies.\" The trio appeared on NPR's Mountain Stage, where they performed two songs from the album as well as \"Save the Best for Last\", a hit single for Vanessa Williams that was co-written by Waldman, and a cover version of Leonard Cohen's \"Dance Me to the End of Love\". The Refugees released their second album, Three, in 2012. In a review of the album, Wood & Steel magazine said \"the trio's rich musical chemistry is readily on display, giving the record a cohesive sound that often feels as intimate as a living room house concert.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAs a female trio\n\nUnbound (2009)\nAs a female-and-male trio\n\nThree (2012)\nHow Far It Goes EP (2019)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Refugees at Discogs\nhttp://www.deborahholland.net/music/the-refugees/"

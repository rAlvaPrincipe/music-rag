    "text": "Santo & Johnny were an American rock and roll instrumental duo of Italian descent from Brooklyn, New York, composed of brothers Santo Farina (born October 24, 1937) and Johnny Farina (born April 30, 1941).\nThey are known best for their instrumental melody \"Sleep Walk\", one of the biggest hits of the golden age of rock 'n' roll, which became a regional success and eventually scored the top of the Billboard pop chart when it was released nationally during 1959.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nSanto Anthony Farina and John Steven Farina were born in Brooklyn, New York, to Anthony and Josephine Farina: Santo on October 24, 1937, and Johnny on April 30, 1941.\nTheir father was drafted into the United States Army while they were children and was stationed for some time in Oklahoma. After hearing a steel guitar on the radio, he wrote to his wife, \"I'd like the boys to learn to play this instrument\".\nUpon returning from World War II, the boys' father found a music teacher who gave the boys steel guitar lessons. When Santo was a teenager, he was able to get a local music store to modify an acoustic guitar, allowing him to play it like a steel guitar.\nWithin two years, Santo was performing in amateur shows using a new Gibson six-string steel guitar and had started receiving lessons from a steel guitar teacher who had studied in Hawaii. By the age of 14, Santo was composing songs, and formed an instrumental trio with a guitarist and drummer. This trio appeared at local dances and parties, performing both original compositions and some Hawaiian standards. With money Santo made from these performances, he bought a Fender steel guitar, one with three necks, each with eight strings. This allowed him to experiment even more, and he tried different tunings until he found ones that appealed to him.\nWhen Johnny reached the age of 12, he began to play accompaniment to Santo on a standard electric guitar. The brothers soon formed a duo and became rather popular in school, eventually performing at events in the New York boroughs. They recorded a demo that they circulated to local New York record companies.\nWhen Johnny turned 16, he told their father that they would be quitting school to pursue a career as \"rock stars\", to which their father responded \"The only stars are in the sky.\"\nThe brothers wrote a song one night when they \"couldn't sleep after playing a gig, and started jamming.\" The song was \"Sleep Walk\" and during September 1959 it scored at the top of the American charts.\n\n\n=== Music career ===\nThe brothers eventually came to the attention of a music publishing company and signed a songwriter's contract and eventually landed a recording contract with Canadian-American Records. Their first release, \"Sleep Walk\", was credited as being composed by the two brothers plus Santo's wife, Ann, although Johnny later said that her name was put on by mistake.\n\"Sleep Walk\" was recorded at Trinity Records in Manhattan. It reached Billboard magazine's No. 1 position for two weeks during September 1959, and earned a Gold record for Santo & Johnny. The follow-up single \"Tear Drop\" (spelled \"Teardrop\" on the album Encore) was also successful, though their long-playing record Santo & Johnny was less successful in the United States.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\n\"Sleep Walk\" continues to be popular owing to consistent radio airplay as well as its usage for commercials, television programs, and movies. Santo & Johnny were inducted into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in 2002.\nThe duo broke up in 1976. After this split, Johnny continued to perform as a solo artist, and is still touring as of 2021. By contrast, Santo retired from the music industry in the 1970s, for reasons he did not disclose.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nCanadian-American Records Ltd\n\nSanto & Johnny (1959)\nEncore (1960)\nHawaii (1961)\nCome On In (1962)\nAround the World... with Santo & Johnny (1962)\nOff Shore (1963)\nIn the Still of the Night (1964)\nSanto & Johnny Wish You Love (1964)\nThe Beatles Greatest Hits Played by Santo & Johnny (1964)\nMucho (1965)\nSanto y Johnny en México (1965?)\nImperial\n\nThe Brilliant Guitar Sounds of Santo & Johnny (1967)\nGolden Guitars (1968)\nOn the Road Again (1968)\nThe Best That Could Happen (1969)\nBlack Tulip\n\nThe Original Recordings\nAniraf Record Co. \n\nChristmas Mine – Johnny Farina (2012)\nPure Steel (2007) Johnny Farina\nChristmas Mine (2008) Johnny Farina\nItalian Being Served (2009) Johnny Farina\nChristmas Mine – Johnny Farina (reissued 2012)\nPAUSA (aka: Pause) Records\n\nSanto & Johnny (1976)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nJohnny Farina Official Website, Official Album Discography.

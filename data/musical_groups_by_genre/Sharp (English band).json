    "text": "Sharp were an English new wave band active during the mid-1980s, featuring former Jam members Bruce Foxton and Rick Buckler. They released one standalone single, in 1986.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the Jam broke up in 1982, Bruce Foxton pursued a solo career and Rick Buckler formed Time UK, featuring Jimmy Edwards on vocals. After a stop-start career that took over two years to release three singles, and a rapid dwindling of the initial public interest in the band, they effectively broke up.\nFoxton, finding his solo career had followed a similar path to Time UK's, recorded several tracks with Buckler and Edwards. A standalone single, \"Entertain Me\", was released on the independent record label Unicorn, a label created by Mark Johnson a Mod  newsletter publisher.\nTracks from the release were included on a 2002 Time UK compilation album, One More Time.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nRick Buckler – drums\nJimmy Edwards – vocals\nBruce Foxton – bass guitar, backing vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\"Entertain Me\"/\"So Say Hurrah\" (7\", Unicorn PHZ5), 1986\n\"Entertain Me\"/\"So Say Hurrah\"/\"Next Generation\" (12\", Unicorn 12PHZ5), 1986\nOne More Time (Time UK compilation album, Detour DRCD041), 2002\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTime UK site"

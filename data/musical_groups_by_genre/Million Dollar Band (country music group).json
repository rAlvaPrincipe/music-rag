    "text": "The Million Dollar Band was an all-star group of session musicians that often performed on the Hee Haw television variety show from August 1980 through November 1988.\nThe group's members included some of Nashville's most well-known virtuosos at their respective instruments: Chet Atkins, Boots Randolph, Floyd Cramer, Charlie McCoy, Danny Davis, Jethro Burns and Johnny Gimble, along with Hee Haw co-host Roy Clark. Many of them, at one time or another, were members of The Nashville A-Team, the list of session musicians responsible for creating the famous Nashville Sound. Of the group's eight members, only McCoy (the youngest of the group) is still alive as of 2022.\nIts name made reference to the 1956 jam-session Sun Records impromptu group known as \"The Million Dollar Quartet\", which included Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. Although it primarily played instrumental country music, the Million Dollar Band's jam sessions often included influence from jazz, blues, easy listening and other styles that reflected the diverse interests and instruments of the various musicians involved in the project.\n\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nLead guitar:  Chet Atkins\nRhythm guitar: Roy Clark\nMandolin: Jethro Burns\nFiddle: Johnny Gimble\nSaxophone:  Boots Randolph\nPiano:  Floyd Cramer\nHarmonica:  Charlie McCoy\nTrumpet:  Danny Davis\n\n\n== Performance dates ==\nThe group performed on the following 27 Hee Haw episodes:\nHee Haw season 13\n\nEpisode 287, 08-13-1980\nEpisode 290, 10-04-1980\nEpisode 293, 10-25-1980\nEpisode 296, 10-18-1980\nEpisode 299, 12-06-1980\nEpisode 303, 01-17-1981\nEpisode 309, 02-28-1981\nEpisode 312, 03-21-1981\nHee Haw season 14\n\nEpisode 314, 09-19-1981\nEpisode 317, 10-10-1981\nEpisode 320, 10-31-1981\nEpisode 326, 10-12-1981\nEpisode 330, 01-23-1982\nHee Haw season 15\n\nEpisode 340, 09-18-1982\nEpisode 349, 11-20-1982\nEpisode 353, 12-18-1982\nEpisode 356, 01-22-1983\nEpisode 363, 03-12-1983\nHee Haw season 16\n\nEpisode 374, 11-26-1983\nEpisode 386, 02-25-1984\nEpisode 390, 03-24-1984\nHee Haw season 17\n\nEpisode 391, 09-22-1984\nEpisode 396, 10-27-1984\nEpisode 402, 12-08-1984\nEpisode 406, 01-05-1985\nHee Haw season 18\n\nEpisode 438, 02-15-1986\nHee Haw season 21\n\nEpisode 503, 11-26-1988\n\n\n== Sources ==\ntviv.org tviv.org episode schedule\ntvguide.com episode list\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Johnny Gimble website\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto of the group"

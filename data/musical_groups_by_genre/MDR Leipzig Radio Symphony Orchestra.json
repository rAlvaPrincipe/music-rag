    "text": "The MDR-Sinfonieorchester (MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra) is a German radio orchestra based in Leipzig.  It is the radio orchestra of Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, the public broadcaster for the German states of Thuringia, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. It is one of the oldest Radio orchestras in the world and the oldest in Germany. It was founded in Leipzig, Germany in 1923 (9 months earlier than the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra), with 115 musicians. Apart from a short interruption during World War II, it has been the main orchestra of the Central German Broadcasting Company (MDR) since 1924. The orchestra performs concerts in Leipzig at the Gewandhaus. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe orchestra was founded as \"Orchester des Konzertvereins\" (\"Orchestra of the Concert Society\"). It became the \"Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Leipzig\" (\"Radio Symphony Orchestra Leipzig\") in 1924 and later adopted its present name. The Orchestra was dissolved during World War II and reunited in 1946 under the tenure of the conductor Hermann Abendroth, later conducted by Herbert Kegel. During the late 1970s through the 1980s, the principal conductors were Wolf-Dieter Hauschild and Max Pommer.\nIn 1992, the Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra merged with the Radio Philharmonic in Leipzig to form the MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra. Daniel Nazareth was the first principal conductor of the newly formed MDR Symphony Orchestra after German reunification. Subsequent chief conductors have included Fabio Luisi, Jun Märkl, and Kristjan Järvi. \nIn November 2019, the orchestra announced the appointment of Dennis Russell Davies as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2020–2021 season, with an initial contract of 4 years.  In April 2024, the orchestra announced an extension of Davies' contract through the 2026–2027 season.\n\n\n== Ensembles ==\n\n\n=== Chamber music ensembles of the MDR Symphony Orchestra ===\nArcato Streichquartett (since 1999)\nDöring-Bläserquintett (since 1982)\nKammersymphonie Leipzig (since 2006)\nLeipziger Hornquartett (since 1996)\nLeipziger Schlagzeugensemble (since 1983)\nLeipziger Blechbläsersolisten (since 1992)\nMDR Bläserquintett (since 1995)\n\n\n=== Other ensembles ===\nGruppe Neue Musik Hanns Eisler (1970–1993)\nEnsemble Sortisatio (since 1992)\n\n\n== Principal conductors ==\n\n\n== World premieres ==\nThis is a selected list of world premieres given by the orchestra:\n\n\n== See also ==\nMDR Rundfunkchor\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to MDR Sinfonieorchester at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website (in German)"

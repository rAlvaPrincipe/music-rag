    "text": "Smoke City was an English band that blended acid jazz and trip hop, borrowing from Brazilian styles such as samba and bossa nova and some lyrics have excerpts in Portuguese. They are best known for their single \"Underwater Love\", which was a major hit in 1997, after being used in a Levi's television advertisement, \"Mermaids\" (directed by Michel Gondry). In 1997, the band released their first album, Flying Away, which included several hits such as \"Underwater Love\", \"Mr. Gorgeous (and Miss Curvaceous)\" and \"Águas de março (Joga Bossa Mix)\". Smoke City's next album, Heroes of Nature, was released in 2001. An extended version of Heroes of Nature had three more tracks than the original, one of them being a cover version of John Lennon's \"Imagine\".\n\"Underwater Love\" is also a track on the soundtrack for Thicker Than Water, a surf video.\nIn 1998, the band contributed \"O Cara Lindo (Mr. Gorgeous)\" to the AIDS benefit compilation album Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon, which was produced by the Red Hot Organization.\nThe group disbanded in 2002.\nSlant Magazine listed their album Flying Away #20 on their list of greatest trip-hop albums of all time.\n\n\n== Members ==\nNina Miranda (vocals, fx)\nMark Brown (programming, turntables, keyboards, percussion, vocals, fx)\nChris Franck (guitar, keyboards, percussion, bass, vocals)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nConcert photos by Laurent Orseau (Black Session)"

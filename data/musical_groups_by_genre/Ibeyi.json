    "text": "Ibeyi is a French musical duo consisting of twin sisters Lisa-Kaindé Diaz and Naomi Diaz. The duo sings in English, French, Spanish and Yoruba, In Yoruba, Ibeyi (Ìbejì) means \"twins\".\nTheir music has elements of Yoruba, French and Afro-Cuban, and fuses jazz with beats, samples with traditional instruments., Lisa, the lead singer, plays the piano; Naomi plays the traditional Peruvian/Cuban percussion instruments cajón and Batá drum.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\n\nThe fraternal twins (born 13 December 1994, in Paris) lived in Havana for the first two years of their lives, then moved to Paris, where they were educated. They visited Cuba yearly on holiday, but were primarily raised in Paris, where they currently reside.\nTheir father was the famed Cuban percussionist Anga Díaz, who has received a Grammy award for his work with the Latin jazz band Irakere, and was also a member of Buena Vista Social Club ensemble, playing with Ibrahim Ferrer, Rubén González and Máximo Francisco Repilado Muñoz aka Compay Segundo. On his death in 2006, Naomi, then aged 11, learned to play his signature instrument, the cajón. Together the sisters studied Yoruba folk songs. Their mother is French-Venezuelan singer Maya Dagnino, who serves as their manager and encouraged Lisa-Kainde's songwriting.\nIn 2013, they signed to the record label, XL Recordings. Label owner Richard Russell is the only other contributor to their self-titled debut album, released in 2015. Released when they were 20, the album pays tribute to their deceased father and the track Yanira immortalizes the duo's older sister, who died in 2013. The song ends with a synth that sounds like a life-support monitor.\nIn 2014, they received attention for the video for their album's second single, \"River\". The twins appear in a closeup shot throughout, taking turns having their heads forced underwater while the other sings.\nIn 2016, the twins appeared in the short film for Beyoncé's album Lemonade as members of Beyonce's farm utopia that offers a safe space for black women. In May 2016, Ibeyi returned to Havana for live performances at the CHANEL 2016 Cruise collection in Cuba and the international music festival MUSICABANA.\nTheir 2017 album Ash was nominated for IMPALA's European Album of the Year Award.\nIn 2021, Ibeyi released a new ethereal song for the soundtrack of the film How to Stop a Recurring Dream. The track continues their exploration of soulful and otherworldly sounds.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nAs well as their father Anga Díaz, the duo claims Frank Ocean, James Blake, and King Krule among their influences. In live shows, they have covered rapper Jay Electronica's Better in Tune with the Infinite and others.\nTheir recordings also show a strong and spiritual connection to their Yoruba roots, as do the name and themes. They also pay tribute to Santería, a syncretism practiced by many Afro-Cubans, and many Cubans in general.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nXLRecordings – Ibeyi page\nUK Talent Agency Profile\nFrench Talent Agency Profile"

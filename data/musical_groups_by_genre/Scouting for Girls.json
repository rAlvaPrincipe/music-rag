    "text": "Scouting for Girls are an English pop rock band. Their name is a play on the title of the 1908 Scouting handbook Scouting for Boys. The band was formed in 2005 by three childhood friends from London, Roy Stride on piano and lead guitar/vocals, Greg Churchouse on bass guitar and Pete Ellard on drums. They signed to Epic Records in 2007 and released their self-titled debut album that September and it reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart in 2008. To date, it has sold over 1 million copies in the UK.\nScouting for Girls worked on a second album, Everybody Wants to Be on TV, was released in April 2010 and peaked at number 2 on the Albums Chart. This was preceded by the single \"This Ain't a Love Song\", which went to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks. The band went on to release a further five albums: The Light Between Us (2012), Still Thinking About You (2015), The Trouble With Boys (2019), Easy Cover (2021) and their most recent studio album, The Place We Used to Meet, which was released in October 2023.\nTo date, Scouting for Girls have achieved eight top 40 singles, sold over 4 million records in the UK and received over 1 billion global streams. They have been nominated for four Brit Awards and one Ivor Novello Award.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nThe founding members had known each other since childhood. Stride and Ellard met in the Cub Scouts and Churchouse met Stride on their first day at school at Queensmead School in South Ruislip in west London. They attended the school until 1998 then moved on towards a music career. At the age of 15 Roy and Greg were playing together at small gigs in west London. It has been noted that the band was looking for a spirited way of removing themselves from the drudgery of their everyday lives, looking to the whimsy of childhood fantasy through playing a Moog organ.  Churchouse has observed on several occasions that playing bass is something he wanted to pursue as the bass has \"two less strings\".\n\n\n=== Unsigned and early music: pre-2007 ===\nWhilst in university, Stride and Churchouse were in a band called Cape. Scouting for Girls were formed when Stride swapped from playing the guitar to piano. Their first recording was a demo of Keep On Walking which impressed the judges of the 2005 Glastonbury unsigned competition so much that they offered them a place in the final, despite the band having never performed live before. Although they failed to win the competition the band spent the next couple of years building a large online presence through Myspace and hosting their own club nights at the Trinity Pub in Harrow.  \nBy 2007 the band had written and recorded demos of most of the songs that would make up their debut album and received airplay and performed sessions on Radio 1 and XFM.\n\n\n=== 2007-2008: Debut album and early singles ===\nAt the beginning of 2007 Epic Records A&R Nick Raphael received the band's demo CD. So enthusiastic was his response that he immediately phoned up colleague Jo Charrington and said: \"These are hits, let's go see the band in rehearsals!\" According to Charrington every other record label had passed on them.\nOn 14 February 2007, Scouting for Girls were signed to Epic UK (a division of Sony BMG). As the band were signed almost fully formed, with all their songs already written, they headed out to Helioscentric Studios in Rye, East Sussex to begin work on their debut album almost immediately. Produced by Andy Green (Keane, KT Tunstall, The Feeling), the band's first release was the It's Not About You EP, released on 25 June 2007. It sold out, and became the highest-charting limited edition EP in chart history. The album was released in September 2007, and has sold in excess of 1,000,000 copies in the UK alone. It spawned a host of hit singles; \"She's So Lovely\", \"Heartbeat\", and \"Elvis Ain't Dead\".\nScouting for Girls' self-titled album went to number 1 in the UK Albums Chart on 20 January 2008, where it remained for two weeks.\nThe band toured the UK heavily throughout 2007 and 2008, upgrading and selling out venues in every city they performed. During their first tour of 2008, Roy Stride lost his voice en route to a gig in Birmingham and was diagnosed with laryngitis, forcing the band to reschedule a series of dates on the tour. The rescheduled dates included an extra night in London, with the band selling out a record four consecutive nights at the Shepherds Bush Empire. The band's final tour of the year concluded with two sold-out nights at London's Hammersmith Apollo, and one at London's Brixton Academy.\nScouting for Girls also made a series of appearances in Europe, Japan, Australia and America in 2008, including performances at 2008's SXSW Conference in Austin, Texas and CMJ in New York City.\n\n\n=== 2009-2012: Everybody Wants to Be on TV and The Light Between Us ===\nScouting for Girls returned to Helioscentric Studios (East Sussex, UK) in 2009 to commence work on their second album with producer Andy Green (who produced the band's eponymous debut album).  The album, Everybody Wants To Be on TV, was released in the UK on 12 April 2010. The first single to be taken from the record was \"This Ain't a Love Song\" which went straight to number 1 in the UK Singles Chart on 4 April 2010, giving the band 2010's Easter Number 1. The track has been added to radio playlists in Australia, including Sydney Radio Station: Nova 969 FM as at May 2010.\nIn the lead up to the album's release, Scouting for Girls performed in the Woolpack Pub on the set of long-running British soap, Emmerdale for a Radio Aire session.\nScouting for Girls toured their new album throughout 2010, commencing with a full UK tour throughout late April and May 2010.\nThe band also took part in a sponsored Chopper bicycle ride from London to Brighton for the charity WellChild raising over £20,000.

The single peaked at number 37 on the UK Singles Chart, giving the band their sixth Top 40 single overall.\nOn 5 March 2012, Scouting for Girls announced via Twitter that they had begun the process of recording their third studio album, The Light Between Us. The album included the top 20 hit \"Love How it Hurts\" that had reached number 17 in 2011. The Light Between Us debuted at number 10 in the official 100 on 9 September 2012, one week after the release of second single \"Summertime In the City\".\n\n\n=== 2013-2015: Greatest Hits and Still Thinking About You ===\nIn 2013 the band released a Greatest Hits compilation that peaked at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart.\nIn addition to all their singles, the album also featured new material including the song \"Millionaire\" which peaked at 52 in the UK charts after release on 22 July 2013.\nThe band released their fourth album Still Thinking About You in October 2015 on EastWest records. The album reached No.13 on the UK chart and featuring festive fan favourite \"Christmas in the Air (Tonight)\".\n\n\n=== 2017-present ===\nThe band announced a show at London's Bush Hall to coincide with the tenth anniversary of them signing their first record deal. The band held a ticket ballot beforehand and received over 20,000 applications for just 300 tickets. The band announced on social media that they were working on new music for release in 2017.\nScouting for Girls announced on their official website that their next album would be released on 13 October 2017 with the lead single called \"Dancing in the Daylight\". Despite Ten Add Ten featuring 10 new songs, the band refer to The Trouble With Boys as their fifth album in interviews.\nIn September 2019, Scouting for Girls released their fifth album, The Trouble with Boys, featuring the singles \"Count On Me\" and \"Grown Up\" (co-written by James Blunt). A UK tour to promote the new album was also announced for November and December 2019 including a sold out headline show at the Shepherds Bush Empire.\nIn April 2021, Scouting for Girls released their sixth album, Easy Cover consisting of 8 covers, and 3 brand new tracks.

The name was a wordplay similar to the band's name and was partly based on the Dennis the Menace fan club.\nMembers of the fanclub were called Wolfcubs, and received a welcome pack put together by the band which include a CD of recent demos, a membership card which allowed discounted entry to their gigs, a regular SFG newsletter (similar to the famous Scouting For Boys guide book), and badges. When the band signed their record deal, they carried on producing the membership packs for new fans on the road, until the demand became too high to deal with.

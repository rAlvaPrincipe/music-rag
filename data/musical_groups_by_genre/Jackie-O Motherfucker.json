    "text": "Jackie-O Motherfucker is an American experimental music group that formed in Portland, Oregon in 1994.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJackie-O Motherfucker began as a duo consisting of multi-instrumentalist Tom Greenwood and saxophonist Nester Bucket. The group is a collective with a shifting membership that has included more than forty members drawn from the U.S. experimental scene. As of 2008, the core of the group is focused on founding member Greenwood.\nJackie-O Motherfucker embraces free improvisation, drawing from a variety of subgenres including various folk musics of the world (American folk and blues, Native American song, traditional English folk ballads, etc.), free jazz, field recordings, psychedelia, drone, and noise rock. \nThe group's first three albums were limited-run vinyl-only releases on now-defunct Portland label Imp Records. Their first widely distributed album, Fig.5, was released in 2000 and was followed by a series of recordings, including the more meandering Liberation and the folk-oriented Flags for the Sacred Harp, which drew from traditional blues and gospel sources.\nBy this point the group were enjoying a higher profile, including performances at the ATP festival curated by Sonic Youth and Thurston Moore and a cover feature on The Wire.\nSince then, the group has had recordings released by a variety of labels before settling down with the London-based label Fire Records from 2008's Blood of Life. The group also operates its own label of CD-R live recordings, the U-Sound Archive, which features live recordings from Jackie-O Motherfucker as well as other like-minded artists such as Double Leopards, Sunroof!, Decaer Pinga, and Vibracathedral Orchestra.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlchemy...

With the 1968 Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces by the Department of National Defence under the auspices of minister LÃ©o Cadieux and the Government of Pierre Trudeau, the band was disbanded and its members were absorbed into the regiment. 20 years later in 1987, Major Jim Barrett, a former band officer, began efforts to revive the band with permission from the committee of retired colonels which he obtained that year. Warrant Officer Claire Archer became the band's first Director of Music, Over the following ten years under Ron's leadership the Band grew to 40-50 members, eventually having the means to write a constitution in 2003.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe band has the following characteristics:\n\n\n=== Uniform ===\n\nThe following is the general layout of the band's uniform:\n\nA feature of the jacket a traditional Mandarin collar, which is derived from in Qing-era China.

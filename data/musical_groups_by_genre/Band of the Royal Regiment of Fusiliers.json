In 1956 as part of the reductions of the Royal Armoured Corps, the 43rdRTR was redesignated as the 6th (City) Btn, RNF.  In 1967, after the reductions of the Territorial Army (TA) after the 1966 Defence White Paper, the battalion was disbanded and concurrent amalgamated with the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers to form A (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) Coy in the Fusilier Volunteers.  The band followed suite, joining the Fus Volunteers, becoming the Band of the Fusilier Volunteers.\nThough the Fusilier Volunteers sat under the TAVR IIA category (meaning it could deploy as a battalion if mobilised), the band was placed under the TAVR IV category (UOTC and bands).\nFollowing the formation of the 6th (Volunteer) Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in 1975, the band transferred to the new unit and was redesignated as the Northumbrian Band of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.  Following another reduction of the TA in 1999, the band dropped the RRS suffix, while joining the new Tyne-Tees Regiment.\nFollowing the disbandment of the later regiment, the band became the Band of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers on 1 April 2006, and joined the reformed 5th (Volunteer) Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.\nThe band is currently based at St George's Barracks in Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\n\n== Organisation ==\nThe current band is separated into three 'ensembles':\n\nMarching Band — performs at numerous Royal, Civic, Public, and Private Engagements\nFanfare Trumpeters — provides a Regal opening for that more prestigious Occasion\nBrass Quintet — provides a wide selection of music for the more subdued event\n\n\n== Notable performances ==\nIn December 2013 the band, joined by members of the Northern Band of the Royal Corps of Signals, Heavy Cavalry and Cambrai Band, Band of the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment to perform at Gateshead Metrocentre.

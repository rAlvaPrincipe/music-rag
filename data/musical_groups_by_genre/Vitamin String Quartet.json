    "text": "Vitamin String Quartet (VSQ) is an American musical group from Los Angeles known for its series of tribute albums to rock and pop acts. \nVSQ is a series of string quartet projects developed and produced by CMH Records, an independent record company based in Los Angeles. The CMH team works with an evolving cast of arrangers, producers, string players, and other creatives on each project. Their albums are released through Vitamin Records and are primarily performed by a string quartet, although other instruments have been used. \"Vitamin String Quartet is about applying rock n' roll attitude to classical technique,\" said Tom Tally, a violist and arranger who has performed on and produced over 50 Vitamin String Quartet albums.\nTheir albums feature various genres, including pop and rock, metal, emo, punk, techno, country, and hip-hop, and a wide variety of groups, such as The Beach Boys, Gorillaz, Oasis, 311, Depeche Mode, Simple Plan, Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Offspring, Rush, Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Senses Fail, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Bruce Springsteen, Crossfade, Jimi Hendrix, The Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, System of a Down, The Killers, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Coldplay, Linkin Park, Muse, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Slayer, Kanye West, Adele, Lady Gaga, and Lana Del Rey, among others. Their discography includes over 400 albums.\nThe group began in 1999 \"as an experiment in transforming rock and pop songs with classical instruments.\" It later expanded to include a variety of popular music.\nFrom 2012 until 2014, their music was played 24 hours a day on the FM broadcast station WWHK in Concord, New Hampshire.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nIn 2008, VSQ contributed a recording of \"Jack and Sally Montage\" to Nightmare Revisited, on which the original score for the 1993 film The Nightmare Before Christmas was reinterpreted by bands like Tiger Army, The All-American Rejects, Plain White T's, Rise Against, and DeVotchKa.\nSongs by Vitamin String Quartet were featured on the Fox television show So You Think You Can Dance twice in 2008. \"Control\" from Vitamin String Quartet Tribute To Janet Jackson appeared on an episode that aired on July 30, 2008, and \"Hallelujah\" from Vitamin String Quartet Tribute To Paramore appeared on an episode that aired the day after. Songs appeared again on the show in Season 6 in 2009. Legacy Perez used \"Flashing Lights\" by Kanye West as a track for a solo elimination dance that aired December 9, 2009. \"Yellow\", originally by Coldplay, featured on the show with guest dancers on the Top 10 elimination show, The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers. This episode aired on  December 2, 2009.\nIn June 2009, they branched out by including a few original songs on their album Perversions, which also included covers of bands such as Broken Social Scene, No Age, and Sigur Rós.\nTwo songs from Vitamin String Quartet Tribute to Coldplay, \"Yellow\" and \"Clocks,\" were used in an episode of the TV show The Vampire Diaries on April 22, 2010.\nIn 2011, Vitamin String Quartet backed Thirty Seconds to Mars for their MTV Unplugged performance and appeared on the EP recording of the concert.\nVitamin String Quartet covered INXS's \"Never Tear Us Apart\" and Pat Benatar's \"We Belong\" in the 100th episode of Gossip Girl.\nVitamin String Quartet's cover of \"Home\" by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros was featured in the finale of the fifth season of Modern Family on May 21, 2014.\nVitamin String Quartet's cover of Nine Inch Nails' \"Something I Can Never Have\" was featured in the fifth episode of the first season of the HBO series Westworld, \"Contrapasso\", and their cover of Radiohead's \"Motion Picture Soundtrack\" was featured in episode six, \"The Adversary\".\nVitamin String Quartet's cover of the Red Hot Chili Peppers \"Scar Tissue\" was featured on the soundtrack of King of Staten Island in 2020.\nVitamin String Quartet has many covers featured in the Netflix series Bridgerton, such as Nirvana's \"Stay Away\" and Robyn's \"Dancing On My Own\". Covers of Billie Eilish's \"Bad Guy\" and Lady Gaga's \"Poker Face\" were used in the 2024 Doctor Who episode \"Rogue,\" serving as an homage to Bridgerton.\n\n\n== Partial discography ==\n\n\n=== 0–9 ===\nThe String Quartet Tribute to 3 Doors Down\nThe String Quartet Tribute to 311\n\n\n=== A ===\nBack in Baroque: The String Quartet Tribute to AC/DC\nVitamin String Quartet Performs AC/DC\nVitamin String Quartet Performs Adele's Skyfall (single release)\nVitamin String Quartet Performs Adele\nVitamin String Quartet Performs Adele's Rumour Has It (single release)\nVitamin String Quartet Performs Amy Winehouse\nThe String Quartet Tribute to Aerosmith\nString Quartet Tribute to AFI\nThe String Quartet Tribute to Alice in Chains\nPrecious Things: The String Quartet Tribute to Tori Amos (2001)\nPieces: The String Quartet Tribute to Tori Amos, Vol. 2 (2007)\nString QuaTributeibute to Animal Collective: Banshee Beat\nVitamin String Quartet Performs As I Lay Dying's An Ocean Between Us\nVitamin String Quartet Performs Arcade Fire\nString Quartet Tribute to Arcade Fire's Funeral\nString Quartet Tribute to Atreyu\nString Quartet Tribute to Audioslave\nString Quartet Tribute to Avicii's Wake Me Up\nString Quartet Tribute to Avenged Sevenfold\n\n\n=== B ===\nThe String Quartet Tribute to Bad Religion: History Repeating\nString Quartet Tribute to Bastille's Pompeii\nThe String Quartet Tribute to The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds\nThe String Quartet Tribute to The Beatles\nVitamin String Quartet Performs The Beatles Vol. 2\nThe String Quartet Tribute to Björk\nThe String Quartet Tribute To Björk: The Remixes\nIce -

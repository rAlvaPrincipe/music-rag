    "text": "Casiokids are a Norwegian synthpop ensemble from Bergen, and Stavanger formed in 2005. The band consists of Ketil Kinden Endresen, Fredrik Øgreid Vogsborg, Omar Johnsen and Kjetil Bjøreid Aabø. Associated musicians are Joachim Amundsen Trana, Eirik Utne, Einar Olsson, Geir Svensson and Snorre Sturla Lyngstad. They are signed with Universal Records in Norway, Polyvinyl Records in North America, Flake Records in Japan, Pop Frenzy in Australia and Moshi Moshi Records for the rest of the world.\nAfter releasing the single \"Grønt lys i alle ledd / Togens hule\" in the United Kingdom, the band was described by NME as \"the best thing to come out of Norway since black metal.\" The band has been compared to fellow Norwegian artists The Whitest Boy Alive, Röyksopp, and Annie. They have released an album named Topp Stemning På Lokal Bar that includes the song \"Fot i hose\", which was included in the comedy series Friday Night Dinner (as transitional music) and on the soundtrack for the football video game FIFA 10, and listed by the NME as the fourth best new song of the week. They are currently managed by Christopher Wareing.\nIn the summer of 2010 legendary Norwegian pop band a-ha gave away four separate prizes of one million kroner each to Norwegian artists who they felt had the most export potential at that time. Casiokids was one of the recipients along with Susanne Sundfør, Moddi and Shining.\nIn October 2011 the band released their new album Aabenbaringen over Aaskammen in North America, Norway and Japan, with a worldwide release scheduled for January 2012. In November 2011 Casiokids visited Japan for the first time.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nFuck MIDI (2007)\nTopp Stemning På Lokal Bar (2010)\nAabenbaringen over aaskammen (2011)\nTid for Hjem (2024)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nwww.casiokids.com\nVideo session for 'They Shoot Music - Don't They'"

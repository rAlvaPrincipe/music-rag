    "text": "Steril is a German electro-industrial/alternative electronic band founded in 1989 in Oldenburg.\nTogether with bands like Front Line Assembly, Project Pitchfork and Download Steril made the Off Beat Label the biggest independent label for electronic music in Germany.\nBesides many appearances on electronic/EBM/industrial compilations, Steril has its own catalogue counting 5 full length cds and a couple of maxi singles.\nOver the last decade, the sound of Steril has been influenced by the developments in the industrial electronic genre. Nevertheless, a Steril track from 1994 is as recognizable as a track from 2006. Steril combines pounding club beats, complex arrangements and aggressive guitar riffs. The track are well composed with catchy hooks.\nSterils underground success in Germany soon spilled out over the borders, where its whole catalogue was licensed to 21st Circuitry (US) and Westcom (UK). Hits like \"No Remission\",  \"Egoist\" and \"Deep\" were well received in the US and UK, Portugal, Brazil and Australia.\nSteril is not just a studio band. They support their driving, powerful sound with an entertaining and energetic live show. In 1996, they toured Germany with Haujobb and Covenant, and in 2014 they supported Front 242 on some dates in Germany.\nAfter a long studio silence, Steril reappeared in 2003 with its album Purification. The album contained 11 tracks combining ambient, rave, hip-hop, metal, pop and electronica.\nThe album was in the German Top 20 (DAC) for many weeks. STERIL signed at StrangeWays Records in Hamburg (Wolfsheim, Boytronic, Sparks, Goethes Erben, etc.).\n\n\n== Line up ==\nMÃ¤hne Meenen (Vocals)\nAxel Tasler (Guitars & Programming)\nJan Wilking (Keyboards & Programming)\nLive supported by\n\nAndreas Ruest (Drums)\nHauke Dressler (Mixing)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\tSteril, Line-up live at Nocturnal Culture Night 2018 in Deutzen, Germany\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Discography ==\nEmpiricism (2019, Frankahdafi Records)\nMisanthrop (2016, Frankahdafi Records)\nRealism (2006, Artoffact)\n400 Years of Electronic Music (2006, Artoffact)\nPurification (2003, Artoffact)\nVenustrap (1996, Artoffact)\nEgoism (1996, 21st Circuitry)\nTransmission Pervous (1995, 21st Circuitry)\n\n\n== References =="

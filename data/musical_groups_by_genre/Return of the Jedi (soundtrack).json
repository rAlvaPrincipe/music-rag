    "text": "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the film score to the 1983 film Return of the Jedi, composed and conducted by John Williams and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London between January and February 1983. Again, John Williams served as producer. Herbert W. Spencer, Thomas Newman and Gordon Langford served as orchestrators. Engineer Eric Tomlinson, music editor Kenneth Wannberg, and record supervisor Lionel Newman again reprised their respective duties. The score earned another Academy Award nomination for Williams. Return of the Jedi, which is the original trilogy's shortest score, was only released on a single-LP instead of a double-set like the Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back soundtracks before it.\nThe 1983 original version was remastered by Sony Classical and released on LP in 2015. A remastered version of the soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on May 4, 2018. This remaster was newly assembled from the highest-quality tapes available, rather than sourced from the existing 1983 album masters.\n\n\n== Original 1983 release ==\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\nLP vinyl released by RSO; compact disc released by Polydor\n\nTotal Time: 44:59\nThis track listing is also shared with the 2015 vinyl release by Sony Classical and the 2018 release by Walt Disney Records.\n\n\n=== Weekly charts ===\n\n\n== Subsequent releases ==\n\n\n=== Release history ===\n\n\n=== Star Wars Trilogy: The Original Soundtrack Anthology ===\n\nIn 1993, 20th Century Fox Film Scores released a four-CD box set containing music from the original Star Wars trilogy. This release marked the first time that the complete contents of the original double-LP releases of the scores from the first two films became available on CD. Disc three in the set was devoted to Return of the Jedi, with further tracks on disc four.\n\n\"20th Century Fox Fanfare with CinemaScope Extension\" - 0:23\n\"Main Title/Approaching the Death Star\" - 5:22\n\"Han Solo Returns (At the Court of Jabba the Hutt)\" - 4:08\n\"Fight in the Dungeon\" - 3:41\n\"The Return of the Jedi\" - 5:02\n\"The Emperor Arrives\" - 2:07\n\"The Death of Yoda\" - 6:05\n\"Parade of the Ewoks\" - 3:27\n\"Luke and Leia\" - 4:47\n\"The Emperor Confronts Luke\" - 3:29\n\"Into the Trap\" - 2:39\n\"First Ewok Battle/Fight With the Fighters\" - 7:24\n\"The Forest Battle\" - 4:04\n\"The Final Duel/Into the Death Star\" - 3:40\n\"The Emperor's Death\" - 2:44\n\"Darth Vader's Death\" - 2:33\n\"Through the Flames\" - 1:39\n\"Leia Breaks the News/Funeral Pyre for a Jedi\" - 2:22\n\"Ewok Celebration/Finale\" - 7:58\nBonus Tracks (disc four of the same set)\n\"Heroic Ewok/The Fleet Goes Into Hyperspace\"\n\"The Ewok Battle\"\n\"Lapti Nek\"\n\"Faking the Code\"\n\"Brother and Sister\"\n\"Leia is Wounded/Luke and Vader Duel\"\n\"The Return of the Jedi (Alternate)\"\n\"Leia Breaks the News (Alternate)/Funeral Pyre for a Jedi (Film Version)\"\n\"Ewok Celebration (Film Version) /End Credits (Film Version)\"\nThe second part of track twenty-one, \"End Credits (Film Version),\" is from The Empire Strikes Back.\n\n\n=== 1997 Special Edition ===\n\nIn commemoration for the franchise's 20th anniversary in 1997, RCA Victor released 2-disc limited edition soundtracks for each film in the original trilogy. The release got a title The Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition. For Return of the Jedi only, two newly recorded music tracks were added at George Lucas's request. John Williams wrote and recorded a new ending melody with the London Symphony Orchestra titled \"Victory Celebration\", replacing \"Ewok Celebration\" from the original release. Jerry Hey composed and arranged \"Jedi Rocks\" as a replacement for \"Lapti Nek\". \nSony Classical Records re-issued the soundtrack on September 21, 2004 under the title Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack). The 2-disc set was advertised as the complete score despite missing several musical cues and original tracks.\n\nAlthough released as the complete score, there are several cues not on the Special Edition that have been released on previous releases. These include:\n\n\"Lapti Nek\" (Album) – This is released on the anthology set and is replaced on the SE with \"Jedi Rocks\".\n\"Leia's News\" (Alternate) – This is released on the anthology set. The film version however is heard on the SE.\n\"Ewok Celebration\" (Ewok Source) – This is released on the anthology set but is replaced on the SE with the new celebration music written for the SE.\n\"Ewok Celebration\" (Choir Source) – This is released on the anthology set and is an alternate vocal mix (using only the choir, not the Ewok voices).\n\n\n== Unreleased cues ==\nCurrently, several source cues and other material are unavailable. Many of these master tapes could not be located in time for the score's Special Edition release and are presumed lost. These tracks include:\n\n\"Jabba the Hutt's Concert Suite\" - All but the final portion of this original recording, incorrectly edited onto the end of the cue \"Han Solo Returns\" on the Anthology, remains unreleased. (This same portion is heard on the Return of the Jedi DVD menu as well).\nUnused Source Cue - A 90-second-long piece of unused source music described as sounding like \"elevator synth music\". It was originally meant to play either at some point after \"Jabba's Baroque Recital\" or possibly instead of it.\nFilm Version of \"Lapti Nek\" (Original Source) - Several versions of this source cue written by John Williams' son Joseph are available. Currently available are the album version on the Anthology and an extended album version and an instrumental track released on an LP single. However, the film version has yet to be released.\n\"Fancy Man\" (English Version of \"Lapti Nek\" sung by Joseph Williams) - This cue can be heard partially in From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga, but remains either lost or simply unreleased. Williams later released a version of the song as \"Urth\", with him singing both Huttese and English lyrics - as well as parts of the \"Ewok Celebration\", which he also wrote.\n\"Max Rebo Source\" - Source Cue - This piece, performed by the resident musicians in Jabba's court (The Max Rebo Band) has never been released. It is heard after Chewbacca is taken away. This cue can also be heard almost totally complete in From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga, but remains unreleased.\n\"Jabba Sail Barge Source\" - Source Cue - A continuation of \"Max Rebo Source\" with slight alterations and different instrumentation (primarily played on synthesizers) that is heard on Jabba's sail barge.\nAlternate Film Takes - Several cues such as \"Superstructure Chase\" are presented on the SE using incorrect and often flubbed takes.\n\"Battle for Endor Insert\" - This insert can be heard in the film when Chewbacca and the Ewoks use the AT-ST to blow up another AT-ST and is similar to a section from \"The Forest Battle Concert Suite\" but has never been released.\n\"Ewok Celebration\" (Film Version) - Two versions of this cue have been released, however, neither preserves the actual original recording used in the film.\n\"Freedom\" - Original English demo version of \"Ewok Celebration\".\n\n\n== Recording Information ==\n\n\n=== Cue list ===\nR1P2 Main Title\nR1P3 Approaching the Death Star\nR1P3X New Bar 23\nR1P4 Vadar Contacts Luke\nR1P5 The Iron Door\nR1P6-R2P1 To Jabba's Throne\nR2P2 Jabba Source No. 1\nR2P3 My Favorite Decoration\nR2P4 Lapti Nek\nR2P5 Jabbas Prisoners\nR3P1 Max Rebo Source\nR3P2 The Big Thaw\nR3P2XI\nR3P2XII Jabba More Sinister\nR3P3 A Strange Visitor\nR3P4-R4P1 Fight in the Dungeon\nR3P4X\nR4P1A The Sentence\nR4P2 Jabba Sail Barge Source\nR4P3 The Sarlacc Pit\nR4P4 Jabba's End\nR4P4R Jabba's End\nR4P5 The Emperor\nR4P5X\nR4P5XII\nR5P6-R6P1-Pt1 Yoda's Scene\nR5P6-R6P1-Pt2 Luke and Ben\nR6P2 Battle Plans\nR6P3 Faking the Code\nR6P3X\nR6P4 Jungle Encounter\nR7P1 After the Bike Chase\nR7P2 Enter the Ewok\nR7P3-R8P1 More Trouble\nR8P2 More Ewoks Appear\nR8P3 Ewok Source No. 1 (Ewok Drums)\nR8P4 Using the Force\nR8P5 Bedtime Stories\nR8P6-R9P1 Ewok Source No. 2 (Ewok Drums 2)\nR9P2 Brother and Sister\nR9P3 Son Meets Father\nR9P4 Finding an Entrance ([Bar 14] R9P5 The Fleet Enters Hyperspace)\nR9P6-R10P1 Heroic Ewok\nR10P2 The Emperor Confronts Luke\nR10P3 Into the Trap\nR10P4 Rebel Forces Captured\nR10P5-R11P1 First Ewok Battle\nR10P5-R11P1X\nR11P2 Fight With TIE Fighters\nR11P3 The Ewoks Retreat\nR11P4 The Emperor Provokes Luke\nR11P5 The Ewok Battle\nR11P5X\nR11P6-R12P1 Leia is Wounded\nR12P2 The Battle Rages\nR12P3 More Duel (Vadar Stalks Luke)\nR12P4 The Explosion\nR12P5 The Emperor's Death\nR12P6-R13P1 Space Battle\nR12P3 Vadar's Death\nR13P3 Through the Flames\nR13P4 Leia Breaks the News\nR13P4 New\nR13P4 New Fix (R13P4R The Force Theme)\nR13P5\nR13P5A\nEnd Credits\nBrother and Sister\nJabba the Hutt\nParade of the Ewoks\nThe Battle in the Woods\nFancy Man\nFreedom\nNew Finale [Special Edition]\nJedi Rocks [Special Edition]\n\n\n== References =="

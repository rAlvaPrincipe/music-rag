    "text": "Amnesty was an American funk band founded in 1968. Based in Indianapolis, it consisted of lead vocalist Damon Malone, bass guitarist James \"Red\" Massie, drummer Kirk Alexander, guitarist Calvin Williams, trumpeter Herman Walker, saxophonist James \"Gino\" Johnson, keyboardist Joseph Trotter, and percussionist Raphael Barnes. The group's discography consists of the album Free Your Mind, released in 1970, and Hum-Bug b/w Everybody Who Wants To Be Free, released in 2003. The music released by the group was mostly deep funk and soul, with many songs on the records being extended jams.\nThe group gained notability after the song \"Liberty\" off of the album Free Your Mind was sampled in 2018 single \"Lift Yourself\" by Kanye West. The sample was reportedly uncleared by West with the group.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nFree Your Mind (1970)\nHum-Bug b/w Everybody Who Wants To Be Free (2003)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nEverybody Who Wants To Be Free (1971)\nThree Cheers For My Baby - Lord Help Me (1973)\n\n\n== Members ==\nKirk Alexander (drums)\nRaphael Barnes (percussion)\nJames \"Gino\" Johnson (saxophone)\nDamon Malone (lead vocals)\nJames \"Red\" Massie (bass)\nJoseph Trotter (vocals, keyboards, percussion)\nHerman Walker (trumpet)\nCalvin Williams (guitar, vocals)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Laki Mera are a three-piece electronic band, based in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed in 2004 as a recording project by Andrea Gobbi and Laura Donnelly, Laki Mera took their name from the Chimaera of Greek mythology. The lineup was completed with the addition of pianist Keir Long, cellist Trevor Helliwell and drummer Tim Harbinson.\nIn December, 2007, the band announced that they would be offering their debut album, Clutter, free for download prior to its official release. The album was critically well received.\nTheir music has been variously described as folktronica, ambient trip hop, 'lush space jazz' and \"pristine pop chamber music of the highest quality\", as well as being reminiscent of Portishead and Massive Attack backing Cocteau Twin Liz Fraser'. They have been cited as \"one of the most promising, intelligent pop acts Scotland has produced this decade\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nClutter (2008)\nThe Proximity Effect (2011)\nTurn All Memory To White Noise (2013)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nDiet of Worms (2008)\nHow Dare You Remix EP (2010)\nClutter EP (2010)\nMore Than You (2011)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nHow Dare You (2007)\nMore Than You (2011)\nFool (2011)\nCrater (Mogwai remix) (2012)\nSweet Warm Dance (2013)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLaki Mera on Facebook"

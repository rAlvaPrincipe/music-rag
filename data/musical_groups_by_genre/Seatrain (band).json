    "text": "Seatrain was an American jazz rock/roots rock band based initially in Marin County, California, and later in Marblehead, Massachusetts.  Seatrain was formed in 1969, subsequently drawing some members from the Blues Project when it broke up. Seatrain recorded four albums and disbanded in 1973.\n\n\n== Band history ==\nFlutist/bassist Andy Kulberg and drummer Roy Blumenfeld of Blues Project formed the band with Jim Roberts, ex-Mystery Trend guitarist John Gregory, former Blue Grass Boy and Jim Kweskin Jug Band violinist/fiddler Richard Greene, and saxophonist Don Kretmar. Seatrain recorded their first album, Planned Obsolescence, in 1968, but had to release it as a Blues Project album for contractual reasons. In 1969, they released a self-titled LP (Sea Train), but faced a major change in membership a few months later.\nThe group's second self-titled album was released in late 1970 under the single-word name Seatrain. By then, Blumenfeld, Gregory, and Kretmar had been replaced by drummer Larry Atamanuik, keyboardist Lloyd Baskin, and Earth Opera guitarist and former Blue Grass Boy Peter Rowan. The album's \"13 Questions\" was released as a single and became a minor hit in the US, reaching #49 on Billboard's national chart in 1971, and #25 in Canada.\nGeorge Martin produced the album, marking the first time he had acted in that capacity with a rock act since his work with the Beatles. He also produced Seatrain's much-anticipated 1971 follow-up album, The Marblehead Messenger. In September Seatrain toured Great Britain for the first time, usually performing as a support act for Traffic. However, Rowan and Greene left the band soon after to form Muleskinner, while Roberts and Atamanuik joined the backing band of Emmylou Harris. Kulberg and Baskin replaced these members with guitarist Peter Walsh, keyboardist Bill Elliott, and drummer Julio Coronado, but released only one more album, 1973's Watch.\n\n\n== Line-ups ==\nSource:\n\n\n=== 1968–1969 ===\nJohn Gregory – guitars, vocals\nDon Kretmar – saxophone, bass\nRichard Greene – violin\nAndy Kulberg – bass, flute\nRoy Blumenfeld – drums\nJim Roberts – lyricist\n\n\n=== 1969 ===\nDon Kretmar – saxophone, bass\nRichard Greene – violin\nAndy Kulberg – bass, flute\nJim Roberts – lyricist\nRed Shepherd – vocals\nTeddy Irwin – guitars\nBobby Moses – drums\n\n\n=== 1969 ===\nDon Kretmar – saxophone, bass\nRichard Greene – violin\nAndy Kulberg – bass, flute\nRed Shepherd – vocals\nElliot Randall – guitars\nBilly Williams – drums\n\n\n=== 1969–1972 ===\nRichard Greene – violin\nAndy Kulberg – bass, flute\nPeter Rowan – guitars, vocals\nLloyd Baskin – keyboards, vocals\nLarry Atamanuik – drums\n\n\n=== 1972–1973 ===\nAndy Kulberg – bass, vocals, flute\nLloyd Baskin – keyboards, vocals\nPeter Walsh – guitars\nBill Elliott – keyboards\nJulio Coronado – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSea Train (1969)\nSeatrain (1970) (#36 Canada)\nThe Marblehead Messenger (1971)\nWatch (1973)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSeatrain Discography\nAlbum Reviews (The Blues Project and Seatrain)\nFan site detailing the band at various stages of its existence.\nSeatrain discography at Discogs\nSeatrain at IMDb"

Committing wholly to their musical ambitions, the band went on to rent a house in the Dingle Peninsula and lock themselves away for the purpose of writing and recording demos. \"The place we rented was a really old cottage, where we had no television, no phone, no Internet, no transport,\" says Sorcha, \"We were there for 6 months – just our equipment and us. It was an amazing time, ideas were constantly flowing.\"\nIn 2012, Walking on Cars won the Redbull Bedroom Jam competition and gained extensive radio play with their debut single \"Catch Me If You Can\". As a result, the track reached no. 27 in the Irish Charts, where it remained for over 20 weeks. \"Catch Me If You Can\" also reached No.1 on iTunes, and garnered over 450,000 views on YouTube. \"Two Stones\", the band's second single, reached No.12 in the Irish charts, while YouTube views exceeded 1,000,000.\nWalking on Cars released their four-song EP, As We Fly South, in 2013. It was recorded in Attica Studios, Donegal, and produced by Tom McFall (R.E.M, Snow Patrol, Bloc Party, Editors). In July 2014, the band released \"Hand in Hand\" and \"Always Be With You\".\n\n\n=== Chart success ===\nIn 2016, they released their first full-length album, Everything This Way, celebrating the release with CD signings and in-store performances around Ireland. The album went \"double platinum\" and reached number one on the album charts in Ireland, as well as charting in several other European countries.\nIn 2020, the band's single, \"Monster\", was used as the opening theme of the Netflix original series, The Stranger. The eight part miniseries, based on the novel by Harlan Coben, first aired on 30 January 2020.\n\n\n=== Split and later projects ===\nIn August 2020, coinciding with the release of an EP titled Clouds, the band announced that they had split.\nIn 2021, the former lead-singer of the band, Pa Sheehy, undertook a number of solo projects.

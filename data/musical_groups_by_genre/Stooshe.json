Initially signed to Warner Music they released of their first single \"Love Me\", featuring US rapper Travie McCoy, in 2012. Later that year Stooshe were nominated for the BBC's Sound of 2012 poll.\nTheir debut single, \"Love Me\", featuring US rapper Travie McCoy, peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart. They released \"Black Heart\" in June 2012, which peaked at number three after a month in the top 10. A cover of TLC's \"Waterfalls\" was released as a single in November 2012. \"Slip\" was released as the third single and reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart.

Stooshe announced \"Let It Go\" as the second official single, and it was released 1 July 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2010: Formation ===\nStooshe was formed in May 2010 and signed to Warner Music in August 2011. The original concept was to create an urban and soulful Spice Girls. Alexandra Buggs, Karis Anderson and Courtney Rumbold formed following a series of auditions and scouting in Topshop stores over a nine-month period. Rumbold was scouted first, then Buggs, by a stylist in store. Anderson joined last, but did not divulge how she had been discovered. The band members admitted that the group was \"manufactured\" but that their chemistry \"did seem natural\".\nUsing tracks from writing/production duo Future Cut, the group spent the next twelve months developing their look and sound. Anderson said the band's name originates from the word 'stoosh', which is urban slang for something expensive, \"a girl who thinks she's nicer than she is\", or being stoned. They then added 'she' on the end to represent female empowerment. The resulting name is pronounced like the Scottish word \"stooshie\".\n\n\n=== 2011–2013: London with the Lights On ===\nThe group released their first song, \"Fuck Me\", on YouTube on 14 March 2011, originally featuring rapper Suave Debonair. This was subsequently re-recorded under the title Love Me with Travie McCoy. The group also recorded a music video for \"Hot Stepper\", a cover of the 1994 track \"Here Comes the Hotstepper\" by Ini Kamoze at Hyde Park's Wireless Festival in July 2011.\nThe second single, \"Betty Woz Gone\", was released onto iTunes on 28 October 2011, earning placement on BBC Radio 1's In New Music We Trust playlist. In March 2012 they re-released Fuck Me under the new title of Love Me., which served as the lead single from their first album, Stooshe. The track marked the group's first chart appearance, debuting at number five on the UK Singles Chart – having sold 37,789 copies, also peaking at number seven on the Scottish Singles Chart for the week ending 17 March 2012.\n\nStooshe released their second single, \"Black Heart\", on 15 June 2012, which peaked at number three on the UK chart. It was announced in June 2012 that the group would be supporting American rapper Nicki Minaj on the UK leg of the Pink Friday Tour. Stooshe performed a brief set on the Bingley Music Live main stage on 31 August 2012. It was announced in October 2012 that the group would be supporting Jennifer Lopez on a part of the European leg of the Dance Again World Tour.\nOn 15 November, it was reported that the album's release would be delayed until March 2013 after their cover of TLC classic nineties track \"Waterfalls\" failed to chart in the Top 20. Stooshe's debut album was released on 27 May 2013, under the title London with the Lights On. They performed \"Slip\" on Britain's Got More Talent TV show on 1 June 2013. London with the Lights On entered the UK albums chart at Number 8. \"My Man Music\" was announced as the fourth single from the album.\nIn July 2013, they performed at the Alton Towers Live concert.\n\n\n=== 2014–present: Unreleased second album and inactivity ===\nIn Autumn 2013, the band split from their record label due to disagreements over London with the Lights On. They are currently working (as of February 2014) independently on their second album. They have said that eventually they will sign to a new label. They are now under Trilogy Records.\nStooshe announced \"Lock Down\" as their latest single from their upcoming untitled second album, the single was released on 15 January 2016.

    "text": "One Day are an Australian hip hop collective consisting of Horrorshow, Spit Syndicate, Jackie Onassis and Joyride. The collective have released one studio album which peaked at number 2 on the Australian charts.\n\n\n== History ==\nOne Day began as a podcast titled One Day Radio, where four individual artists would contribute. This led to a monthly event in Sydney in 2013.\nIn 2013, Jimmy Nice from Spit Syndicate said \"We all grew up together, went to school together and make music together. We really want to strengthen that connection and have it more as a collective as appeased to four different acts. These guys are family and people we see on the reg, it's not just different acts coming together, we all share a strong bond. Anything we can do to strength that brand is a positive.\"\nFollowing the release of the single \"Love Me Less\" in June 2014, One Day released their debut album, Mainline, on 1 August 2014 through the Elefant Traks. The album peaked at number 2 on the ARIA Charts. The release was followed by a national Australian tour commencing in September 2014 where all seven members of One Day appeared on stage for the first time.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n== References =="

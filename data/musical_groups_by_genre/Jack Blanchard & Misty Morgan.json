    "text": "Jack Blanchard & Misty Morgan were an American country music duo from Florida consisting of guitarist/keyboardist/vocalist Jack Blanchard (born May 8, 1942) and his wife, keyboardist/vocalist Misty Morgan (May 23, 1945 – January 1, 2021). The duo recorded for several labels in the 1970s, including the charting albums Birds of a Feather and Two Sides of Jack and Misty. Between 1969 and 1976, the duo also released fourteen singles, including \"Tennessee Bird Walk\", a Number One country hit and No. 23 pop hit in 1970.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJack Blanchard was born on May 8, 1942, and Misty Morgan was born on May 23, 1945. Both were born in the same hospital in Buffalo, New York and lived in Ohio as children. They met in 1963 in Florida, where Blanchard was working as a comedian and Morgan as a pianist. They married in 1967. She was diagnosed with cancer in late December 2020 and died at age 75 on January 1, 2021.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\nThe two were already collaborating on 45s released by Miami's Zodiac label in 1965. In 1967, the now-married duo began playing music together, and, in 1969, signed to Wayside Records to release its first single, \"Big Black Bird (Spirit of Our Love)\", which peaked at No. 59 on the U.S. country singles charts. After it came the novelty song \"Tennessee Bird Walk\", which went to Number One on the country charts and No. 23 on the pop charts.  The duo followed-up with another novelty hit, \"Humphrey the Camel\", at No. 5 country and No. 78 pop.\nThe duo's second album, Two Sides of Jack and Misty, was released on Mega Records two years later. It produced four more chart singles, including the No. 15 \"Somewhere in Virginia in the Rain\" and another novelty song, \"The Legendary Chicken Fairy\". Later in the 1970s, Jack Blanchard & Misty Morgan released six singles on Epic Records, reaching Top 40 for the last time in 1974 with the No. 23 \"Just One More Song\". Except for a compilation album called Sweet Memories in 1987, the duo did not release any other material until 1995's Back in Harmony. From there, they began recording on a self-established independent label, \"Velvet Saw Records\" (named after Jack's nickname). From 2005 through 2008 they released three archival CD albums on Australia's Omni Records label.\nTheir song 'Yellow Bellied Sapsucker' was used in an episode of the third series of Australian television drama Tangle.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBirds of a Feather (Wayside Records, 1970) US No. 185, US Country No. 16\nTwo Sides of Jack and Misty (Mega Records, 1972) US Country No. 35\nSweet Memories (Chalice Records, 1987)\nBack in Harmony (Playback Records, 1995)\nBack from the Dead (BAM Records, 2000)\nA Little Out of Sync (Velvet Saw Records, 2001)\nMasters of the Keyboards (Velvet Saw, 2001)\nJack and Misty are Crazy (Velvet Saw, 2003)\nBeginnings (Velvet Saw, 2004)\nBack From the Dead, Vol. 2 (Velvet Saw)\nLife and Death (and Almost Everything Else) (Omni Records, 2006)\nWeird Scenes Inside the Birdhouse (Omni Records, 2007)\nNashville Sputnik the Deep South/Outer Space Productions of Jack Blanchard & Misty Morgan (Omni Records, 2008)\nTraveling Music (Velvet Saw Records, 2009)\nJust One More Song – The 2012 Recordings (Velvet Saw Records, 2012)\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\nAB-side to \"There Must Be More to Life (Than Growing Old)\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://jackandmisty.net The Jack Blanchard & Misty Morgan Official Home Page.\nJack Blanchard & Misty Morgan discography at Discogs\nJack Blanchard & Misty Morgan at IMDb Misty Morgan\nJack Blanchard & Misty Morgan at IMDb Jack Blanchard\nEntry at 45cat.com"

    "text": "Black Strobe (sometimes Blackstrobe) is an electroclash group formed in Paris in 1997 by record producer Arnaud Rebotini and DJ Ivan Smagghe. They were instrumental in the rise of the electroclash movement in the UK with their breakthrough single \"Me and Madonna\". Originally producing in the house genre, they later became more influenced by music from the 1970s and 1980s, especially industrial post punk and European electronic body music. They describe their sound as \"frozen balearic gay biker house\". They are heavily influenced by acts such as Cabaret Voltaire, Nitzer Ebb, Front 242, and Depeche Mode. \nThe group's members are in high demand as remixers, and worked with such diverse artists as Röyksopp, Nitzer Ebb, Rammstein, The Rapture, and Tiefschwarz. Ivan Smagghe left in 2006 as Black Strobe expanded to a four-piece live band, with members David \"Siskid\" Shaw (guitar), Bastien Burger (bass and keyboard), and Benjamin Beaulieu (drums) joining Rebotini on vocals. Smagghe was contributing lyrics before his departure. They released their debut album Burn Your Own Church in 2007.\nTwo songs from Burn Your Own Church have appeared in other forms of media. \"I'm A Man\" appeared in the 2008 film RocknRolla, the 2009 film Le Mac, and the second episode of the AMC series The Walking Dead. It was also copied without permission and used in the 2010 Bollywood film Once Upon a Time in Mumbai. \"Shining Bright Star\" was featured in the Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood multiplayer launch trailer. In 2013, their track \"Boogie in Zero Gravity\" was featured on Radio Mirror Park in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V.\nIn 2009, after remixing other music artists' tracks, Black Strobe released the EP Back From Beyond, which was accompanied in early 2010 by a video directed by Laurent Chanez, whom the group had met in 2004 through the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nParis Acid City (Source Records 1997)\nInnerstrings (Output Recordings 2000)\nMe And Madonna (Output Recordings 2002)\nItalian Fireflies (Kitsuné Music 2003)\nDeceive/Play (Blackstrobe Records 2005)\nLast Dub On Earth (Crosstown Rebels 2006)\nBlack Metal (Playlouderecordings 2007)\nI'm A Man (Playlouderecordings 2007)\nShining Bright Star (Playlouderecordings 2007)\nBlood Shot Eyes (Playlouderecordings 2013)\n\n\n=== EPs and studio albums ===\nChemical Sweet Girl EP (Output Records 2004)\nShining Bright Star EP (Playlouderecordings 2006)\nMe & Madonna EP (Kitsune 2010)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n2001 Playgroup - \"Number One\"\n2002 Cosmo Vitelli - \"Robot Soul\"\n2002 Märtini Brös - \"The Biggest Fan\"\n2002 Justin Robertson presents Revtone - \"Everpresent\"\n2002 Sir Drew - \"Shemale\"\n2002 W.I.T. - \"Hold Me, Touch Me\"\n2002 Rammstein - \"Mutter\" (cancelled)\n2003 Dominatrix - \"The Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight\"\n2003 The Hacker, Millimetric & David Carretta - \"Moskow Reise\"\n2003 The Rapture - \"Sister Saviour\"\n2003 Röyksopp - \"Eple\"\n2003 Tiefschwarz - \"Ghostrack\"\n2003 Tones on Tail - \"Means of Escape\"\n2004 Alexkid - \"Pick It Up\"\n2004 Alter Ego - \"Rocker\"\n2004 Dave Clarke - \"What Was Her Name?\"\n2004 Depeche Mode - \"Something to Do\"\n2004 David Guetta - \"The World Is Mine\"\n2004 Oscar - \"Loa\"\n2004 Rammstein - \"Keine Lust\"\n2004 Sweet Exorcist - \"Test Four\"\n2005 Bloc Party - \"Like Eating Glass\"\n2005 Fischerspooner - \"Never Win\"\n2005 The Hacker - \"Flesh & Bone\"\n2005 White Rose Movement - \"Love Is a Number\"\n2005 Sweet Light - \"Abusator\"\n2006 Nitzer Ebb - \"Getting Closer\"\n2007 Olga Kouklaki - \"Getalife\"\n2007 Vive La Fête - \"La Route\"\n2007 The Neon Judgement - \"13.13\"\n2007 The Penelopes - \"Demian\"\n2008 Ayumi hamasaki - \"About You\"\n2010 Lindstrom & Christabelle - \"Baby can't Stop (Tsugi mix)\"\n2010 Acid Washed - \"General Motors, Detroit, America\"\n2010 tape to tape - \"pure & easy\"\n2010 Majeure - \"The Dresden Codex\"\n2010 Taxi Girl - \"Chercher le garçon\"\n2010 The Toxic Avenger - \"Angst: One\"\n2011 Turzi Electronic Experience - \"Connaissance\"\n2011 The Subs - \"Decontrol\"\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Pacemakers were a late-1960s American funk group that consisted of bassist William \"Bootsy\" Collins, his older brother Phelps \"Catfish\" Collins on guitar, Philipp√© Wynne on vocals, and drummer Will Jackson (later replaced by Frankie \"Kash\" Waddy). \nThe Pacemakers were little-known outside Cincinnati, Ohio, until 1969. After most of James Brown's band quit over a pay dispute, The Pacemakers were hired in 1970 as replacements. They formed the cornerstone of Brown's new backup band, The J.B.'s.\n\n\n== References ==\nDavid Mills, Larry Alexander, Thomas Stanley, and Aris Thomas, George Clinton and P-Funk: An Oral History (New York: Avon Books, 1998).

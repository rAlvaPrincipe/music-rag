SNM presents concerts devoted entirely to contemporary music, funds commissions, produces recordings and presents awards to young composers.\n\n\n== History ==\nSNM was founded in 1971 by Neva Pilgrim with the main purpose of promoting contemporary music in the Central New York Region.\n\n\n== Mission and Work ==\nSNM commissions new works, and advocates for composers through Society News (their in-house print and digital publication) and via their radio show, Fresh Ink on WCNY-FM. SNM provides regional musicians with opportunities to perform music by their peers. Works are offered on television, radio, and live performances.\n\n\n== Commissions ==\nSince its inception, SNM has commissioned new works by over fifty composers from the Central New York region, including faculty from Syracuse University, the Eastman School of Music, Cornell University, and many other schools in the area.

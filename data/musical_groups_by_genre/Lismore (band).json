    "text": "Lismore is an electronic music group formed by vocalist Penelope Trappes and composer/instrumentalist Stephen Hindman in 2004. The group uses both live instruments and programmed beats to achieve their sound.\n\n\n== Members ==\nPenelope Trappes (vocals)\nStephen Hindman (programming, guitars)\n\n\n== History ==\nTwo next door neighbors, Australian-born Penelope and Ohio-bred Stephen, an ex dj/producer (Kingsize), blindly began making electronic pop songs together unwittingly creating their acclaimed glitchy debut CD, We Could Connect Or We Could Not. As 'You Aint No Picasso' said: \"Lismore sound like a wicked collaboration between Ladytron and Daft Punk.\"\nLismore had been playing in NYC and extensively touring the US and Canada throughout 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, and is no longer an active band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nWe Could Connect or We Could Not (2005)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nIt Takes Guts To Deceive So Eloquently (2006)\nAll That You Are EP (2007)\n\n\n== External links ==\nLismore official site at the Wayback Machine (archived March 14, 2008)"

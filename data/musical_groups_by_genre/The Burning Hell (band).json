    "text": "The Burning Hell is a Canadian band fronted by songwriter Mathias Kom and multi-instrumentalist Ariel Sharratt, particularly known for their literate songwriting, DIY ethos, and dynamic live performances. Kom holds a PhD in ethnomusicology at Memorial University of Newfoundland, where he studied the political economy of DIY music.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Burning Hell began in 2006 as the songwriting project of Mathias Kom. During the first few years of the band's existence, band membership fluctuated from tour to tour and album to album and the band's instrumentation was often determined by what instruments Kom's friends played. The regular touring and recording lineup from 2011 to 2016 was consistently Kom, Ariel Sharratt (clarinet), Darren Browne (guitar), Nick Ferrio (bass) and Jake Nicoll (drums). Since 2013 Kom and Sharratt have embarked on occasional duo tours and since 2017 the band has toured with a variety of lineups, always including Sharratt—who switches between drums, bass, and woodwinds—and frequently Browne and/or Nicoll. Since 2022, their live lineup has been rounded out with a rotating fourth band member, these guests have included Steve Lambke, Kelly McMichael, Toby Goodshank and Shotgun Jimmie.\nKnown for their live shows and hyper-literate lyrics, The Burning Hell have toured extensively in Europe, North America, and Australia. Kom's songs frequently take the form of fantastic narratives (\"Bird Queen of Garbage Island\", \"The Stranger\", \"Barbarians\", \"Nonfiction\", \"Grave Situation Pt. 1\"). Other subject matter has included the apocalypse (\"When the World Ends\", \"Supermoon\", \"Birdwatching\"); failure and amateurism (\"Give Up\", \"Amateur Rappers\", \"Professional Rappers\"); and nostalgia and pop music (\"Nostalgia\", \"Men Without Hats\", \"Grown-Ups\").\n\nIn 2011, Kom and Sharratt co-founded the Lawnya Vawnya Festival in St. John's, Newfoundland.\nIn 2012 the band played 10 shows between the Netherlands and Slovenia in twenty-four hours. The band claims the unofficial world record for playing the most shows in different countries in 24 hours.\nIn 2014, the tribute album My Name Is Mathias, featuring Canadian and international musicians performing the band's songs, was released, featuring covers by artists such as John K. Samson, Mike O'Neill, Mike Feuerstack, Dan Mangan, Dave Bidini, Great Lake Swimmers and Susie Asado. Kom donates all proceeds from the sale of this album to the Kingston Humane Society.\nThe Burning Hell released the albums Public Library in 2016, Revival Beach in 2017 and Never Work in 2020.  Garbage Island was self-recorded and produced by Kom, Sharratt, and Nicoll during the pandemic, and released in 2022 on You've Changed Records and BB*Island.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nTick Tock (2006), Weewerk\nHappy Birthday (2008), Weewerk\nBaby (2009), Weewerk\nThis Charmed Life (2010), Weewerk\nFlux Capacitor (2011), Weewerk\nPeople (2013), BB*Island\nPublic Library (2016), BB*Island\nRevival Beach (2017), BB*Island\nGarbage Island (2022), BB*Island, You've Changed Records\nEPs\n\nThe Burning Hell and Construction & Destruction (2009) split 7-inch, Independent\nSaddle Sores (2011), Ticker Records\nHear Some Evil (2011) split 7-inch with Wax Mannequin, Label Fantastic!\nDuets mit Germans (2011), Ticker Records\nOld, New, Borrowed, Blue (2013) 10-inch, Headless Owl Records\nBirdwatching On Garbage Island (2019), Independent\nHardly Working (2024)\nSingles\n\n\"Grave Situation Part One\" (2008) split 7-inch with Jenny Omnichord\n\"Amateur Rappers\" / \"Professional Rappers\" (2014) 7-inch\n\"Pop Goes The World\" / \"Men Without Hats\" (2016)\n\"9 To 5\" / \"Game Of Pricks\" (2019)\n\"No Peace\" (2019) split 7-inch with Boo Hoo\n\"I Want to Drink in a Bar\" (2020) split 7-inch with B.A. Johnston\n\"Bird Queen of Garbage Island\" / \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" (2021) 7-inch with accompanying comic book\n\"Nigel the Gannet\"/ \"Lark Descending\" (2022)\nCompilations\n\nMy Name Is Mathias (2014), Headless Owl Records\nLive Animals (2015), Independent\nFolk Duo Albums by Mathias Kom & Ariel Sharratt\n\nDon't Believe the Hyperreal  (2015), BB*Island\nNever Work (2020), BB*Island\nHardly Working (2024) with Shotgun Jimmie\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMusic of Canada\nCanadian rock\nList of bands from Canada\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Burning Hell official website\nBB*Island Record label (for Europe)\nHeadless Owl Records Record label (for Canada)\nweewerk Record label (until 2001)"

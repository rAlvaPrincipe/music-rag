    "text": "The Herbaliser is an English jazz hip hop group formed by Jake Wherry and Ollie Teeba in London, England during the early 1990s. Although currently releasing on their own label and having previously been signed to !K7 Records, they were one of the best-known acts from the Ninja Tune independent record label. They have released 12 albums, including two DJ mixes: one for Ninja Tune's Solid Steel series and the other for Fabric's Live Mix series. The Herbaliser's album Same As It Never Was was their first release on !K7 Records. Their latest album Bring Out The Sound was released in 2018, on the BBE label.\nJake Wherry has also recorded solo tracks as The Meateaters, released on the Parisian Big Cheese label, and has worked with The Propheteers.\nOllie Teeba is also part of Soundsci with Jonny Cuba of Dynamic Syncopation, Audessey ex-Mass Influence, U-George The Hemisphere and Oxygen Sputnick Brown\n\n\n== History ==\nJake Wherry grew up in South West London and played guitar and bass in a number of jazz, funk and rock bands in his teenage years. During this time, he met Patrick Carpenter aka PC, later one of the DJs behind DJ Food, and through him became aware of the Ninja Tune label. Ollie Teeba, (real name Oliver Lawrence Trattles) began DJing at 15 and played his first live sets to London audiences a year later.\nWherry and Teeba met years later at Wherry's Traintrax studio, and began recording together, collaborating with DJ Malachi, Kaidi Tatham of Bugz in the Attic and Ralph Lamb of Easy Access Orchestra. They developed a jazzy instrumental style of hip hop, due to an absence of available rappers. They passed their recordings on to Ninja Tune bosses Matt Black and Jonathan More of Coldcut and were signed shortly thereafter.\nInspired by the funk bands of previous decades, rather than performing simply with turntables, Jake Wherry decided to take a seven piece band on tour, which included Tatham, Lamb, Andrew Ross, Micah Moody Jnr and percussionist Patrick Dawes. The band performed in Toronto, Ontario on 1999.\nAs they progressed, they gained access to guest vocalists for appearances on their records, including What? What? (aka Jean Grae), Roots Manuva, MF Doom, Seaming To, Rakaa Iriscience of Dilated Peoples, Blade, Phi Life Cypher, Bahamadia, Dream Warriors and Insight .\nThe pair were subsequently employed to produce music for the likes of Motorola, the soundtracks to Guy Ritchie's Snatch and the PlayStation 2 game Tony Hawk's Underground. They were also commissioned to write the theme for ESPN's primetime NFL show Sunday Night Football.\nThe group have also provided production for artists including T Love, Princess Superstar and remixes for artists including DJ Food, Raw Stylus, Push Button Objects, Jaffa and label-mates Coldcut's \"Atomic Moog\", which reached number one on the UK singles chart.\nIn 2009, the band released its second live band album, Session Two. This was recorded at The Easy Access Orchestra's studio and mixed at Jake's Train Trax Studio.\nJake Wherry was featured in the Gimlet Media podcast Heavyweight featuring the collaborative production of a track with a fan.  Since 2021, Wherry has been working on tracks with Portuguese-British singer Maya Blandy, with \"Stardust\", her debut track released in 2023, featuring house vocalist Kathy Brown.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nAs The Herbaliser:\n\nRemedies (1995, Ninja Tune)\nBlow Your Headphones (1997, Ninja Tune)\nVery Mercenary (1999, Ninja Tune)\nSomething Wicked this Way Comes (2002, Ninja Tune)\nTake London (2005, Ninja Tune)\nSame As It Never Was (2008, !K7 Records)\nThere Were Seven (2012, Department H.)\nBring Out The Sound (2018, BBE)\nAs The Herbaliser Band:\n\nSession One (2000, Department H.)\nSession Two (2009, !K7 Records)\nDJ mix albums:\n\nSolid Steel Presents Herbal Blend (2003, Ninja Tune)\nFabricLive.26 (2006, Fabric)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nHerbal Tonic (2010, Ninja Tune)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nThe Real Killer/Blow It EP (1995)\nRepetitive Loop/Scratchy Noise EP (1995)\nThe Flawed Hip-Hop EP (1996)\nNew & Improved/Control Centre (1997)\nThe Blend EP (1997)\nWall Crawling Giant Insect Breaks EP (1998)\nRoad of Many Signs/Moon Sequence EP (1999)\nMissing Suitcase EP (1999)\n8 Point Agenda/Who's Really The Reallest?

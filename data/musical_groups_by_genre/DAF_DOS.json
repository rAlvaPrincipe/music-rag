    "text": "DAF/DOS was an electronic music project formed by Gabriel \"Gabi\" Delgado-López in 1995 as a continuation of his work with Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft (D.A.F.) (the 'DOS' in the band name refers to the Spanish word for 'two').\n\n\n== History ==\nGabi recorded the album 'Allein, zu zweit, mit Telefon' with Wotan Wilke Möhring (who started an acting career a few years later), and then went solo for the 1999 album 'Der DAF/DOS Staat' (a live recording of this project was also released around the same time). The original D.A.F. lineup would reform a few years later, and the 'DOS' incarnation of 'D.A.F.' has not been heard from since.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nAllein, zu zweit, mit Telefon (1996)\nDer DAF/DOS Staat (1999)\nDer DAF/DOS Live Staat (1999)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nIch glaub' ich fick' dich später (1996)\nStimme des Herzens (1996)\nNordisc EP (1997)\nInternational Song (1999)\n\n\n== References ==\nhttp://www.discogs.com/artist/DAF+%2F+DOS\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/DAF%252FDOS"

The band often changed members, featuring at different times members of bands such as Tuxedomoon, Factrix and others active in the then-thriving San Francisco experimental, post-punk and industrial scenes.\nMinimal Man remained active in San Francisco recording on the Subterranean Records label until the mid-1980s, after which Miller relocated to Europe, often working with compatriots Tuxedomoon who had made a similar move previously.\nThe Minimal Man output ceased after the 1980s, and Miller returned to Los Angeles, where he worked as a set dresser.\nMiller died at his home in Eagle Rock on December 14, 2003.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nThe Shroud Of (1981)\nSafari (1984)\nSex with God (1985)\nSlave Lullabyes (1986)\nHunger Is All She Has Ever Known (1988)\nPure (1988)\nExtended plays\nSex Teacher (1985)\nSingle\n\"She Was a Visitor\"/\"He Who Falls\" (1980)\n\"Two Little Skeletons\"/\"Tired Death\" (1983)\n\"Mock Honeymoon\" (1987)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMinimal Man discography at Discogs\n\"The Pop Life; Drugs, Demons: A Man in a Mask\" â€“ New York Times article on Minimal Man"

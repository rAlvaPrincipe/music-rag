    "text": "Loadstar were a music production duo from Bristol, United Kingdom. They produced mainly drum and bass, while also working in other genres such as dubstep and electro. The duo consisted of Gavin \"Xample\" Harris and Nick \"Lomax\" Hill. They previously produced under the alias Xample & Lomax.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2007–2009: Record deal and formation ===\nThe two artists met while Bristol-born Xample was studying sociology at Liverpool University. Lomax was one-third of the production trio Holdtight at the time. Xample booked Holdtight for a drum and bass event, and Lomax moved to Bristol shortly afterwards. Xample sent some tracks to Andy C via instant message, and soon afterwards was signed to his label RAM Records.\nThe duo's first release was the track \"The Latter\" which was released on 28 May 2007. It featured as a B-side to Xample's track \"Lowdown\" and was released on RAM Records. Their second collaboration was \"Contra\" (released as a single on 2 February 2009). Throughout 2009 they shared studio space and began to release more material together.\n\n\n=== 2010: Formation of Loadstar ===\nOn 26 April 2010, they released a single on RAM titled \"Remember / Rushin Dragon\". On 27 September 2010, they released their first song under the Loadstar alias: \"Link to the Past / Rapidas\". To tie in with the song title they looked through old rave tape packs and computer game cassettes until they found an old E-mu sampler. The old interface took a long time to load each sample and displayed a spinning star while loading. Hence the moniker \"Loadstar\" was born.\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: Commercial breakthrough ===\nDuring late 2010, the duo also started producing for Hadouken!, starting with their singles \"Mecha Love\" and \"Oxygen\". On 14 November 2010, their remix of Example's \"Two Lives\" was released as their first Loadstar remix. In 2011 collaborations became more frequent, including remixes for Breakage, Chase & Status and Jess Mills. They received airplay from major radio stations such as BBC Radio 1, and were asked by Annie Mac to create a mashup of Jessie J's \"Price Tag\". On 28 March 2011, they released the second Loadstar single, titled \"Space Between / BLVD\". \"Space Between\" was their first track to have an official music video. On 24 July 2011, their track \"Kaoss\" was released as part of RAM 100, the label's hundredth release.

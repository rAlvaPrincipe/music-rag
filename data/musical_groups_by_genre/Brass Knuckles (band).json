Global touring followed the release, bringing them to Asia and Europe. This leg of touring included a variety of dates in Croatia, as well as an opening set in front of 10,000 people supporting genre legend Fatboy Slim.\nIn 2012, having attracted attention of major labels, they signed with Ultra Records and released their first single with them, \"Bad Habits\".  \"Bad Habits\" peaked at #27 on Billboard Club Play Charts and #45 on Billboard Dance Charts, and was featured on Ultra Music 14 and Ultra/Wynn Presents XS Las Vegas Sessions: Vol. 2. At Ultra Music Festival 2013, well-known electronic groups Knife Party, Krewella and Adventure Club played “Bad Habits” in their live DJ sets in Miami; Knife Party playing it both weekends.\nThe music video for \"Bad Habits\", released in November 2012, sparked debate, as it included footage dealing with heavier issues such as drug usage and extreme violence. Vibe interviewed the trio later on, and revealed the background story behind the true message of the video.\n\n\n=== 2013-present ===\nEarly in 2013, Brass Knuckles released \"Hurricane\", an additional Beatport exclusive peaking at No. 24 on the Electro/House Charts.

    "text": "Nalle is also a Finnish nickname for persons named Björn; notables include Björn Wahlroos and Björn Westerlund.\n\nNalle (Finnish for a small bear, generally a teddy bear, and named after a childhood toy of vocalist Hanna Tuulikki) are a psychedelic folk trio, based in Glasgow, who were formed in the summer of 2004. They comprise Finnish-English vocalist Hanna Tuulikki (vocals, kantele, flute), Aby Vulliamy (viola) and Chris Hladowski (bouzouki, clarinet) from Bradford.

The ladies have now reunited and are touring.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFor Real secured their recording contract by accident. \"We were picking up our manager from the airport. So we decided to greet him with an acappella song. Someone from A&M Records just happened to be in the airport and heard us perform. Not long after, we were signed,\" said Latanyia Baldwin.\nThe band released their debut album, It's a Natural Thang, with production from Brian McKnight on A&M Records in 1994, and it became a critical success, including a rare four stars from Rolling Stone magazine. Their first single, \"You Don't Wanna Miss\" hit #28 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart; the group's second single, \"Easy to Love\", peaked at #65 on the same chart. The third single, \"You Don't Know Nothin'\", peaked at #88 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also peaked at #54 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1995. The album sold over one million copies worldwide, and peaked at #80 on the Billboard 200.\nIn 1995, the band appeared in Italian Vogue, modeling men's suits.

But don't worry, we're bringing it back!\"\nAfter a label change from A&M to Dallas Austin's Arista imprint Rowdy Records in 1996, For Real released their second album Free. The first two singles were \"Like I Do\" and \"The Saddest Song I Ever Heard\".\nThe band also recorded three songs (\"I Do\", \"Born to Love That Boy\" and \"Unwanted Number\") and appeared in the critically acclaimed film Grace of My Heart.

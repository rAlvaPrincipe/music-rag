    "text": "Swayzak are a tech house duo from the United Kingdom that consist of James S. Taylor and David Brown. They released their first 12\" single \"Bueno\" / \"Fukumachi\" in February 1997 to much acclaim. It was followed up by the 12\" \"Speedboat\" / \"Low Rez Skyline\" to become part of the burgeoning tech-house scene in the UK. \nTheir debut album, Snowboarding in Argentina was released by The Medicine Label (US) and Pagan Records (UK) in May 1998. It garnered many positive reviews. The album was later chosen as 1998 Album of the Year in the U.S. dance publication Mixer. They went on to release four further studio albums.\nJames Taylor left the group in 2011 to focus on his solo project Lugano Fell. David Brown continues to release music and play live as s_w_z_k. Taylor and Brown regrouped as Swayzak in 2023.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSnowboarding in Argentina (1998, Pagan)\nHimawari (2000, Medicine)\nDirty Dancing (2002, !K7)\nLoops from the Bergerie (2004, !K7)\nSome Other Country (2007, !K7)\ns_w_z_k (2012, Tresor)\n\n\n=== Compilations and DJ mixes ===\nSnooploops and Sneakbeats Volume 1 (1999, Swayzak Recordings)\nTwo Hundred and Forty Volts Volume 1 (1999, Swayzak Recordings)\nSnooploops and Sneakbeats Volume 2 (2000, Swayzak Recordings)\nTwo Hundred and Forty Volts Volume 2 (2000, Swayzak Recordings)\nGroovetechnology, Vol. 1.3 (2001, !K7)\nFabric 11 (2003, Fabric)\nRoute de la Slack (2006, !K7)\nAvantgarde // Swayzak Presents Serieculture (2006, Avantgarde)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nmicrosite of current album with free track\nRBMA Radio on Demand - Train Wreck Mix - Swayzak (K7!, Swayzak, London)\nAbleton Live Swayzak interview and Live Pack download\n»Lost Tapes and Lush House Grooves« An Interview with Swayzak in Titel-Kulturmagazin"

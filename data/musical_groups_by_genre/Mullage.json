    "text": "Mullage are a Dirty South hip hop and contemporary R&B duo from Atlanta, composed of B Boi and B Town. \nThe two grew up a few miles from each other and met while in the US Navy when they were stationed in Virginia. While still in the Navy they recorded albums and mixtapes under the underground label Final Destination Records with producer/artist/CEO Chris Mooty. \nOnce they were both out, they moved back to Atlanta and signed to From the Ground Up Records. The group's name is a combination of the words \"musical collage\". Their debut single, \"Trick'n\", was released in early May 2009 and entered the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\nElevators: The Pre-Album (Hosted by DJ Ill Will & DJ Rockstar) (2009)\nThis Is For The Radio (Hosted by DJ Ill Will & DJ Rockstar) (2010)\nBelievers Never Die (2015)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMullage on Twitter \nMullage on Instagram"

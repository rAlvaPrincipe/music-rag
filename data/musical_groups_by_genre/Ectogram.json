    "text": "Ectogram were a Welsh band from Bangor, Wales.\nAnn Matthews and Alan Holmes were previously members of Welsh language post-punk band Fflaps between 1987 and 1993, touring Europe, releasing three LPs, and recording two John Peel Sessions during that time. When the band's drummer Jonny Evans left in 1993, they recruited old friend Maeyc Hewitt and morphed into the quite different sounding Ectogram.\nThe band initially recorded two singles for the small Welsh independent label, Atol, before being signed to the more well-known Ankst label, for whom they recorded an album and two EPs. When that label dissolved in 1998, Ectogram stayed with Ankstmusik, the label set up by one of the former Ankst partners.\nTheir music combines conventional rock elements such as repetitive rhythms and vocal melody with atonal discord and improvisation. Their style has been influenced by bands such as Sonic Youth, Faust, Pere Ubu, My Bloody Valentine and Acid Mothers Temple. BBC Radio Wales DJ, Adam Walton described their guitar style as 'Egoless textures and exploratory sonics.'\nAll three members of Ectogram were also members of the experimental rock supergroup The Serpents, who released an album on the Ochre label in 1999.\nDuring 2005, Ectogram played a series of gigs with krautrock group Faust, at times joining them on stage for a collaborative performance, and in 2012 they acted as a backing band for a performance by ex – Can member Damo Suzuki.\nIn late 2015, Gigwise listed Ectogram as one of their 27 Greatest Welsh Bands Of All Time.\nDrummer Maeyc Hewitt died of cancer 2 October 2015 and the band's website suggested that this was possibly the end of Ectogram as a band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n1996 I Can't Believe it's not Reggae! – (Ankst)\n2000 All Behind the Witchtower – (Ankstmusik)\n2002 Tall Things Falling – (Ankstmusik)\n2005 Electric Deckchair – (Ankstmusik)\n2006 Concentric Neckwear – (Pure Pop For Now People)\n2007 Fluff on a Faraway Hill – (Klangbad)\n2012 Exo-Celestial – (Turquoise Coal)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n1994 Spio Trwy Tylla – (Atol)\n1995 Mary – (Atol)\n1995 Spoonicon EP – (Ankst)\n1997 Eliot's Violet Hour – (Ankst)\n1998 Spitsbergen – (Ochre)\n1999 Evanescence – (Ochre)\n2006 Y Lleill EP – (Ankstmusik)\n\n\n=== Split Releases ===\n1998 Stolen Ecstasy – (with Flowchart) (100 Guitar Mania)\n1998 Spitsbergen Part 4 – (with The Land of Nod) (Ochre)\n2001 Füxa vs. Ectogram – (with Füxa) (Ochre)\n2007 Split CD – (with Klaus Kinski) (Giant Hammer)\n\n\n=== Compilation Appearances ===\n1995 S4C Makes Me Want to Smoke Crack – (Atol)\n1995 Triskadekaphilia – (Ankst)\n1996 Plan Boom – (What's That Noise)\n1997 Angels With Big Wings – (Ankst)\n1999 Floralia Vol 3 – (Wot 4)\n1999 Croeso 99 – (Ankstmusik)\n1999 Through the Square Window – (Blue Flea)\n2000 Yr Agog – (Oggum)\n2001 The Stooges – (Snowdonia)\n2003 Radio Crymi Playlist Vol. 1 (1988-1998) – (Ankstmusik)\n2007 Nødutgang 2007 – (Go To Gate)\n2007 Klangbad Festival 2007 – (Klangbad)\n2008 Radio Crymi Playlist Vol. 2 (1998-2008) – (Ankstmusik)\n2008 Mind Expansion Compilation 2 – (Mind Expansion)\n2009 Andy – (Pure Pop For Now People)\n2009 50 And Up – (Barbelo)\n2011 Past - Present - Future – (Pure Pop For Now People)\n\n\n=== Film ===\nEctogram recorded the soundtrack for Emyr Glyn Williams's feature film Y Lleill, which won the Bafta for best film at the 2004 Bafta Wales awards.

    "text": "Slough Feg (also known as The Lord Weird Slough Feg) is an American heavy metal band from Pennsylvania, formed in 1990 and currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Taking their name from the Celtic folklore-influenced comic book Sláine, the band released their self-titled debut album in 1996. Slough Feg combines influences from traditional heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Brocas Helm, and Thin Lizzy, as well as English folk metal band Skyclad.\nSlough Feg's 2003 album Traveller was a concept album based on the role-playing game of the same name. With the release of Atavism in 2005, the band officially shortened its name to Slough Feg. Guitarist Mike Scalzi maintains that the band always referred to itself this way internally, and the addition of \"The Lord Weird\" made it too difficult to find Slough Feg albums in stores (which alphabetized the CDs in inconsistent ways). Slough Feg most recently released New Organon in 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\nSlough Feg originated in central Pennsylvania and relocated to San Francisco, California in 1990. The band produced three demo tapes in the early 1990s before releasing their self-titled debut album. Bassist Justin Phelps left the band shortly after. In 1998, European music label Dragonheart signed Slough Feg and the band released their second album, Twilight of the Idols, in 1999. The band released Down Among the Deadmen in 2000 and Traveller in 2003.\nIn 2005, the band moved to Italian record label Cruz del Sur and released their fifth studio album, Atavism. The band also officially shortened their name to \"Slough Feg\" after the album's release. After the change of name, John Cobbett left in good terms with the band, and was replaced by current member Angelo Tringali in January 2005. Around the same time, drummer Greg Haa left Slough Feg for personal reasons, and was replaced by current member Antoine Reuben-Diavola. In 2007, the band released their sixth album (their second with Cruz del Sur), Hardworlder, recorded and produced with former bass player Justin Phelps. In 2008, they released The Slay Stack Grows via Shadow Kingdom Records, a double-CD release of old demos and live recordings from the band's early days.\nSlough Feg toured in Europe and the United States, doing coast-to-coast tours summers of 2005 and 2006, including an appearance at the first annual Alehorn of Power festival in Chicago, Illinois. In January 2013, the band signed with Metal Blade Records.\nHaving returned to their previous label Cruz del Sur Music, Slough Feg released their album New Organon on June 21, 2019.\n\n\n== Lineup ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nMike Scalzi – guitars/vocals (1990–present)\nAngelo Tringali – guitars (2005–present)\nAdrian Maestas – bass (2001–present)\nAusten Krater – drums (2021–present)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nOmar Herd – vocals\nChris Haa – guitars\nAndrew Sebba – guitars\nJohn Cobbett (Hammers of Misfortune, Ludicra, Gwar) – guitars\nJustin Phelps – bass/founding member\nJustin Post – bass\nScott Beach – bass\nJon Torres (Ulysses Siren, Angel Witch, Warning S.F., I4NI, Lȧȧz Rockit, Heathen) – bass\nJim Mack (Black Goat (US), Weakling) – bass\nDave Passmore – drums\nStu Kane – drums\nGreg Haa (Isen Torr) – drums\nAntoine Reuben (Hadan, Black Goat, Weakling) – drums\nHarry Cantwell (Bosse-de-Nage) – drums\nAddison Filipczyk – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Lord Weird Slough Feg (1996)\nTwilight of the Idols (1999)\nDown Among the Deadmen (2000)\nTraveller (2003)\nAtavism (2005)\nHardworlder (2007)\nThe Slay Stack Grows (2008) (compilation)\nApe Uprising!

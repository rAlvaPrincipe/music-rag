    "text": "Third Person was an improvising trio formed in 1990 in New York City, led by cellist Tom Cora and drummer Samm Bennett. Each performance featured an invited guest: A third person. Guests included guitarist Marc Ribot, harpist Zeena Parkins, clarinet player Don Byron and saxophone players George Cartwright  and  Kazutoki Umezu and many others. \nThe trio's music was entirely improvised, but typically quite melodic, and even funky.\nWith Cora's death in 1998, Third Person effectively dissolved.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBends [live] (1990, Knitting Factory)\nTrick Moon (1991, Tsuki no Uso)\nLucky Water (1995, Knitting Factory)\n\n\n== External links ==\nBio"

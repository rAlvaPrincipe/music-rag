    "text": "North Mississippi Allstars is an American blues and southern rock band from Hernando, Mississippi, founded in 1996. The band is currently composed of brothers Luther Dickinson (guitar, lowebow, vocals) and Cody Dickinson (drums, keyboards, electric washboard, vocals). Their most recent album Set Sail was released in 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was formed in 1996 by brothers Luther and Cody Dickinson (sons of Memphis musician and producer Jim Dickinson), along with bassist Chris Chew, with the intention of combining the blues and bluegrass of the North Mississippi region with rock and other modern forms. Their first album Shake Hands with Shorty was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album. Their later albums 51 Phantom and Electric Blue Watermelon have received nominations in the same category. The group also won a Blues Music Award for Best New Artist Debut in 2001.\nStarting in 2000, the Dickinson brothers and Chew have also participated in supergroup The Word with Robert Randolph and John Medeski. The band made its network television debut in 2000 on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and served as the house band on the program Last Call with Carson Daly for a short period in 2004. Guitarist Duwayne Burnside, son of Mississippi blues musician R. L. Burnside, has often collaborated with the group, and was added as an official member in 2003–2004. The band backed John Hiatt on the album Master of Disaster and the associated tour in 2005.\nNorth Mississippi Allstars albums are known for featuring many guest stars; for example, their 2005 album Electric Blue Watermelon included guest appearances by Lucinda Williams, Robert Randolph, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, and traditional musician Otha Turner. Luther Dickinson joined the Black Crowes in 2007 and devoted time to both bands until 2011; he appeared on three Black Crowes studio albums. During that period, Cody Dickinson and Chris Chew formed the side project Hill Country Revue. \nChew left the band in 2015. Since then, the Dickinson brothers have led the group with a rotating cast of supporting musicians. Their 2017 album Prayer for Peace reached number one on the Billboard Blues Albums Chart. Their 2019 album Up and Rolling was selected as a \"Favorite Blues Album\" by AllMusic.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\nLuther Dickinson – guitar, vocals, cigar box guitar, drums, bass (1996–present)\nCody Dickinson – drums, percussion, vocals, guitar, synthesizer (1996–present)\nFormer members\nChris Chew – bass, vocals (1996–2015)\nDuwayne Burnside – guitar, vocals (2003–2004)\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nShake Hands with Shorty (2000)\n51 Phantom (2001)\nPolaris (2003)\nTate County Hill Country Blues (2003, Private Release)\nHill Country Revue - Live at Bonnaroo (2004, live)\nElectric Blue Watermelon (2005)\nParadise Boston, Ma 11.12.05 (2006, Instant Live)\nKeep On Marchin': Live in Burlington, VT 11.11.05 (2007, 2 CDs live)\nMississippi Folk Music - Volume One (2007)\nHernando (2008)\nDo It Like We Used to Do (2009, 2 CDs and DVD live set)\nBoulderado: Live at the Fox (2010, 2 CDs live)\nLive in the Hills 6.26.10 (2010, official live bootleg as North Mississippi Allstars Duo)\nKeys to the Kingdom (2011)\nLive In The Hills II 6.24.11 (2011, official live bootleg)\nWorld Boogie Is Coming (2013)\nFreedom & Dreams with Anders Osborne (2015)\nPrayer for Peace (2017)\nUp and Rolling (2019)\nSet Sail (featuring Lamar Williams Jr.) (2022)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nShimmy She Wobble (2000)\nInstores & Outtakes (2004)\nElectric Blue Watermelon Screwed and Chopped EP (2005)\nUpstairs At United, Vol. 4 (2012, live)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nNorth Mississippi Allstars at AllMusic\nZebra Ranch studio Archived September 22, 2020, at the Wayback Machine\nHill Country Revue Official Website\nNorth Mississippi Allstars collection at the Internet Archive's live music archive"

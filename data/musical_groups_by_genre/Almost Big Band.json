Members included expatriate American such as Kenny Drew and Ed Thigpen as well as prominent Danish jazz musicians such as Jesper Thilo and Bent Jaedig.\nMainly an arranger, Wilkins created the band so he could write for a band of his own formation. In America the band remained underrated and overlooked. \n\n\n== Current members ==\nBenny Rosenfeld, lead trumpet\nMårten Lundgren, trumpet\nGerard Presencer, trumpet\nVincent Nilsson, lead trombone\nKim Aagaard, trombone\nJan zum Vohrde, lead alto\nPernille Bévort, tenor saxophone\nJan Harbeck, tenor saxophone\nJesper Løvdal, baritone sax, bandleader\nNikolaj Bentzon, piano\nJesper Lundgaard, bass\nAage Tanggaard, drums\n\n\n== Past members ==\nJesper Thilo, tenor saxophone\nJens Winther, trumpet\nErling Kroner, trombone\nBent Jædig tenor saxophone\nTim Hagans, trumpeter\nKenny Drew, piano\nEd Thigpen, drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nErnie Wilkins & the Almost Big Band (Storyville, 1980)\nAlmost Big Band Live (Matrix Music Marketing, 1981)\nMontreux (SteepleChase, 1983)\nOn the Roll (SteepleChase, 1984)\n\n\n== References =="

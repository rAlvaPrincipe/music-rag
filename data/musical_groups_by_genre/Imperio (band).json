    "text": "Imperio was an Austrian Eurodance/dream trance group formed in 1994 by producer Norbert Reichart.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\nThey released their first album \"Veni Vidi Vici\" in 1995. Four singles were released from this album. At the time, of its release, the group was fronted by singer Manuela Ray and rapper Michael Harris. Later in 1995, Harris left the group and Lawrence Madia was chosen as a replacement. They released their second album \"Return To Paradise\" in 1996. Afterwards, the group disbanded in 1997.\nYears after the disbandment of Imperio, it was revealed that Manuela Ray and Michael Harris did not perform any of the vocals on the songs, as they were done by Austrian singer Tini Kainrath (who would later become a member of The Rounder Girls and represent Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest 2000), and Portuguese rapper Paulo Martins. Lawrence Madia did not perform any vocals either, as all the songs from Return to Paradise did not feature any rapping due to Paulo Martins departing the group around the same time as Michael Harris.\nKainrath and Martins were also featured in another one of Reichart's eurodance projects, Decadance.\n\n\n== Members Timeline ==\nStage Performers:\n\nManuela Ray (1994-1997)\nLawrence Madia (1995-1997)\nMichael Harris (1994-1995)\nStudio Vocalists:\n\nTini Kainrath (1994-1997)\nPaulo Martins (1994-1995)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDanceartistinfo.com\nEurokdj.com\nDiscography"

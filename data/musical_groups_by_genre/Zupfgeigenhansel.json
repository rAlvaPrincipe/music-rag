    "text": "Zupfgeigenhansel was a German folk duo, one of the most successful groups to emerge on the German folk scene in the 1970s. It consisted of Erich Schmeckenbecher and Thomas Friz. The group was named after the collection of folk songs of the same name, which was published in 1909. \nThe group started playing in folk-clubs, mainly in southern Germany, in 1974. They then started appearing on the radio programme Liederladen of the Südwestfunk broadcasting station. They released their first album, Volkslieder I for the pläne record company in 1976, and later in the year their second album, Volkslieder II. In 1978 they received the award of \"Artists of the Year\" in one of the categories of the  German Phonoakademie. They disbanded in 1985.

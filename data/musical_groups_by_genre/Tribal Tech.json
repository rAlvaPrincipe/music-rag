    "text": "Tribal Tech was a progressive fusion band, originally formed in 1984 by guitarist Scott Henderson and bass player Gary Willis. From 1993 forward the band included Scott Kinsey on keyboard and Kirk Covington on drums, and released ten albums that stretched the borders between blues, jazz, and rock. The band dissolved following the release of 2000's Rocket Science, with the various members pursuing solo careers. However, they re-formed to release another album, X, in 2012. In 2014, Henderson and Willis decided to disband once again.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMembers:\n\nScott Henderson - guitar\nGary Willis - bass\nScott Kinsey - keyboards\nKirk Covington - drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSpears (1985)\nDr. Hee (1987)\nNomad (1990)\nTribal Tech (1991)\nIllicit (1992)\nFace First (1993)\nPrimal Tracks (compilation) (1994)\nReality Check (1995)\nThick (1999)\nRocket Science (2000)\nX (2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nScott Kinsey's website\nDavid Goldblatt's website\nScott Henderson's website\nGary Willis' website\nDrummerworld.com article on Kirk Covington\nFacebook Group - Tribal Tech Addicts\nTribal Tech Live At Big Mama - Italy (2000) (Real Video)\n2015 Scott Henderson Interview on Guitar.com"

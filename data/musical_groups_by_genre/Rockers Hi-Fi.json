    "text": "Rockers Hi-Fi were an electronic dub/dance outfit formed in Birmingham, England in 1991 as Original Rockers. In 1994, they changed their name to Rockers Hi-Fi. Their music was quite popular across Europe as an extension and continuation of the dub music genre.\nTheir first success came with a few tracks on the Beyond Records Ambient Dub series of compilations, and \"Push Push\" became a dancefloor hit at the beginning of the 90s.\nThey released four studio albums and also mixed and compiled an album for Studio !K7's DJ-Kicks series.\nTheir urban sound was created by Richard \"DJ Dick\" Whittingham who began his DJ career in Duran Duran's Rum Runner nightclub, he now hosts Leftfoot at the Medicine Bar, and Glyn \"Bigga\" Bush who continues to produce music as BiggaBush and Lightning Head on his own Lion Head label.\nTheir song \"What a Life!\" was part of the soundtrack for the 1995 film The Basketball Diaries, and \"Going Under (Love & Insanity Dub) (K&D Sessions)\" featured in the 2000s film Traffic, as well as in the mid-season finale to the first season of the television series The O.C.\nIn 1992, Richard Whittingham and Glyn Bush founded the label Different Drummer, releasing music from both Original Rockers/Rockers Hi-Fi and others.\n\n\n== Discography Original Rockers ==\nPush Push (single) (1991), The Cake Label\nRockers to Rockers (released 1993 on Different Drummer, with four different tracks compared to the 1995 Rockers Hi-Fi re-release.\n\n\n== Discography Rockers Hi-Fi ==\nRockers to Rockers (Recorded 1993, released 1995, 4th & Broadway / Gee Street Records)\nPush Push (single) (1995) 4th & Broadway\nMish Mash (25 March 1997, WEA Records)\nGoing Under (the Kruder & Dorfmeister Sessions EP) (single) 1997, Different Drummer / WEA\nDJ-Kicks: The Black Album (19 May 1997, Studio !K7)\nOverproof (1998, WEA Records)\nTimes Up (1999, WEA Records)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiggaBush"

    "text": "Brit & Alex were an American girl group consisting of identical twin sisters Brit and Alex Smith. After moderate success with the single \"Let It Go\" (2008), Alex left the group and Brit pursued a solo career as Matisse, after which Brit left the music industry, and as of 2024, has returned with \"Karma's a Bitch\".\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBrit & Alex (born December 3, 1985, in Wilton, Connecticut) became child actors, appearing at age three in the soap opera One Life to Live. They later moved to London, and became known for their appearance as teenagers in advertisements for John Frieda's Sheer Blonde hair products.\nHaving been singers since childhood, they subsequently moved into music full-time, leaving school at age 18 to pursue careers in music. They were signed by Jimmy Iovine of Hometown/Interscope Records. Their debut single, \"Let It Go\", appeared in the soundtrack of the 2008 film Step Up 2: The Streets. This single also features the vocal talents of G. Bamford, and was released on April 28, 2008. Their debut album, Brit & Alex, produced by Dallas Austin and Tricky Stewart, had been scheduled for release in 2009.\nThe popular and critical website Popjustice.com was one of the early supporters of the girls. \"Let It Go\" got to Number 5 in the UK Commercial Club Chart and Number 1 in the Upfront Club Chart, and was released as a CD single in the UK on 28 April 2008. However, it failed to beat its peak of Number 75 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\n== Breakup ==\nIt has been confirmed that Brit & Alex are no longer a group. Alex Smith decided to head back to school, leaving twin sister Brit Smith to pursue a solo career. The duo are no longer signed to Interscope Records, but Brit scored a new deal and was signed to Jive Records as \"Matisse\". Her debut single, \"Better Than Her\", can be purchased on iTunes.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Other Songs ===\nI Like Boys (B-side to Let It Go)\nSleepless (B-side to Let It Go)\nI'll Come Running\nLittle Girl\nKeep It A Secret\nIf You Never Knew\nAre You Ready?

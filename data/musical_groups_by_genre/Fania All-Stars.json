    "text": "The Fania All-Stars is a musical group formed in 1968 as a showcase for the musicians on Fania Records, the leading salsa music record label of the time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nIn 1964, Fania Records was founded in New York City by Jerry Masucci, an Italian-American lawyer with a love for Cuban music, and Johnny Pacheco, a flutist, percussionist and bandleader born in the Dominican Republic but raised in the South Bronx who had like minded musical tastes. Masucci later bought out his partner Pacheco from Fania Entertainment Group, Ltd. and was the sole owner until his death in December 1997.\nThroughout the early years, Fania used to distribute its records around New York. Eventually success from Pacheco's Cañonazo recording would lead the label to develop its roster. Masucci and Pacheco, now executive negotiator and musical director respectively, began acquiring musicians such as Bobby Valentín, Larry Harlow, and Ray Barretto.\n\n\n=== Success ===\nIn 1968, Fania Records created a continuously revolving line-up of entertainers known as the Fania All-Stars. They were considered some of the best Latin Music performers in the world at that time. The original lineup consisted of:\n\nBand Leaders: Ray Barretto, Joe Bataan, Willie Colon, Larry Harlow, Monguito, Johnny Pacheco, Louie Ramirez, Ralph Robles, Mongo Santamaria, and Bobby Valentin.\nSingers; Héctor Lavoe, Adalberto Santiago, Pete \"El Conde\" Rodríguez, and Ismael Miranda.\nOther Musicians; La La, Ray Maldonado, Ralph Marzan, Orestes Vilató, Roberto Rodriguez, Jose Rodriguez, and Barry Rogers.\nSpecial Guests; Tito Puente, Eddie Palmieri, Ricardo Ray and Jimmy Sabater.\nThey recorded Live At The Red Garter, Volumes 1 and 2 with this original lineup. On August 26, 1971 they recorded Fania All-Stars: Live At The Cheetah, Volumes 1 and 2.  It exhibited the entire All-Star family performing before a capacity audience in New York City's Cheetah Lounge.\nFollowing sell-out concerts in Puerto Rico, Chicago, and Panama, the All-Stars embarked on their first appearance at New York's Yankee Stadium on August 24, 1973. The Stars performed before more than 40,000 spectators in a concert that featured Ray Barretto, Willie Colón, Edwin Tito Asencio, Rubén Blades, Larry Harlow, Johnny Pacheco, Roberto Roena, Pellín Rodríguez, Bobby Valentín, and Jorge Santana (younger brother of Carlos Santana), Celia Cruz, Héctor Lavoe, Cheo Feliciano, Ismael Miranda, Justo Betancourt, Ismael Quintana, Pete \"El Conde\" Rodríguez, Bobby Cruz and Santos Colón.  Live at Yankee Stadium was included in the second set of 50 recordings in the U.S. National Recording Registry, solidifying the All-Stars as \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"\nIn 1974, the All Stars performed in Zaire, Africa, at the 80,000-seat Stade du 20 mai in Kinshasa.  This was captured on film and released as Live in Africa (Salsa Madness in the UK). This Zairean appearance occurred along with James Brown and others at a music festival held in conjunction with the Muhammad Ali/George Foreman heavyweight title fight.  Footage of the performance was included in the 2008 documentary Soul Power.\nTo attain a wider market for salsa music, Fania made a deal with Columbia Records in the US for a series of crossover albums by the All-Stars, beginning with Delicate & Jumpy (1976), in which Steve Winwood united with the All-Stars' Pacheco, Valentin, Barreto, and Roena. During the same year, the Fania All-Stars made their sole UK appearance, at London's Lyceum Ballroom, with Winwood appearing as guest.\nIn 1978 the All-Stars released Live, recorded in concert on July 11, 1975 at San Juan's Roberto Clemente Coliseum. In 1979, they travelled to Havana, Cuba, to participate in the Havana Jam festival that took place between 2–4 March, alongside Rita Coolidge, Kris Kristofferson, Stephen Stills, the CBS Jazz All-Stars, Trio of Doom, Billy Swan, Bonnie Bramlett, Weather Report, and Billy Joel, plus Cuban artists such as Irakere, Pacho Alonso, Tata Güines, and Orquesta Aragón. Their performance is captured on Ernesto Juan Castellanos's documentary Havana Jam '79. During the same year the All-Stars released  Crossover and Havana Jam on Fania, which came from a concert recorded in Havana on March 2.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nIn 2009, a historical documentary, Latin Music USA, shown on PBS TV, featured an episode on the Fania All-Stars, their evolution, career, and later demise. In 2009 as well, the All-Stars returned to the stage, opening Carlos Santana's world tour in Bogotá, Colombia. The presentation caused mixed feelings inside the salsa circle though, mainly because they were treated as seconds by the concert's organizers.\nIn March 2011, and subsequently in November 2012, a limited roster of the All-Stars performed in Lima, Peru. One thing to note about the 2012 performance is the return of Ruben Blades. Ismael Quintana was not present in the November 2012 performance though, as well as Yomo Toro (Yomo died on June 30, 2012). In October 2013, a new, complete roster of the All-Stars performed in San Juan Puerto Rico, celebrating the 40th anniversary of their first performance in San Juan. This roster included the return of Orestes Vilato and Luigi Texidor, as well as the participation of Andy Montañez, Cita Rodriguez (Pete's daughter) and Willie Colón. This was Cheo Feliciano's last performance with the All-Stars before dying in a car accident in April 2014 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 2015 the Fania All-Stars were chosen to receive ASCAP's honorary Latin Heritage Award. The All-Stars were set to perform in Central Park, New York City on August 24 as part of the closing of the 50th anniversary celebration of the legendary Fania Records label.\nIn 2019, many of the classic Fania records were re-issued in vinyl as part of the renewed interest in the vinyl record format.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Filmography ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFania All-Stars Archived 2010-02-07 at the Wayback Machine at SalsaClasica.com (Biography, Discography, Lyrics, etc.)\nFania All-Stars discography at Discogs\nFania All-Stars profile Archived 2005-06-11 at the Wayback Machine\nFania Records\n[1]"

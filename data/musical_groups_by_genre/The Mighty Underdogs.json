    "text": "The Mighty Underdogs was an American hip hop supergroup from the San Francisco Bay Area. It consists of rappers Gift of Gab and Lateef the Truthspeaker and producer Headnodic.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Mighty Underdogs was formed when Lateef the Truthspeaker, planning to make his own solo album, listened to some Headnodic-produced tracks, rapped a verse for each, and sent them over to Gift of Gab.\nThe group self-released The Prelude EP in Fall 2007. In 2010, XXL included it on the \"100 Essential Rap EPs\" list.\nTheir full-length studio album, Droppin' Science Fiction, was released on Definitive Jux in October 2008.

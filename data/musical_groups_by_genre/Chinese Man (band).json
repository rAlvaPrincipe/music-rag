    "text": "Chinese Man is a French trip hop band formed in 2004 and originally from Aix-en-Provence, Provence-Alps-French Riviera.\n\n\n== History ==\nThey are influenced by hip hop, funk, dub, reggae and jazz.\nChinese Man is composed of DJ Marseille Zé Mateo and High Ku and beatmaker SLY. Beatmakers Leo le Bug and Le Yan also revolve around the group and participate in the composition of several pieces. Frequent live additions to the crew include Taiwan MC, Youthstar and ASM (Green T & FP). The audiovisual content for which they are well-known is produced by Fred&Annabelle, and VYZ Team. The group's song \"I've Got That Tune\" was chosen by Mercedes-Benz for its promotional campaign and by the 35th French Film Festival in Hong Kong as its theme.\nChinese Man Records is a record label run by the band, based in Marseille.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe group has explained that Chinese Man is the name of the first track the collective produced together in 2004. The track got its name from a vocal sample saying Chinese Man, and they kept that name for the band and for the related label Chinese Man Records (aka CMR).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2005 : The Bootlegs Sessions\n2007 : The Groove Sessions Volume 1\n2009 : The Groove Sessions Volume 2\n2011 : Racing with the Sun\n2012 : Remix with the Sun\n\"The Mourning Son\" (feat.

    "text": "The Danish Youth Ensemble (DUEN; Danish: Det danske Ungdomsensemble) is the national youth orchestra of Denmark. It consists of 25 string players, selected from all over Denmark.\nFounded by the Danish Radio in 2004 as the Danish Radio Youth Ensemble (DRUEN). It became independent in 2011, as DR could no longer afford to fund the project. It was founded with the goal of giving young musicians a chance to develop their skills, alongside introducing other youth to classical music. The performances, therefore, were not limited to traditional concert halls, but also occurred in schools across the country. Additionally, DUEN has played at Vega, Roskilde Festival, and P3 Guld, and seek to combine classical and rhythmic music. \nIt is a member of the European Federation of National Youth Orchestras.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of youth orchestras\n\n\n== References =="

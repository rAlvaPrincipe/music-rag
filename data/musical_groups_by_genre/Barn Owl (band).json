The pair recorded music at home while working on other musical endeavors, and began releasing music in 2007. In 2010 they signed with Thrill Jockey, and released the first of three albums for the label. That year, they also founded their own boutique record label, Electric Totem.\nMusic critics have noted the influences of Alice Coltrane, Keiji Haino, Black Sabbath, Pandit Pran Nath, and Tony Conrad on the group's music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBarn Owl (Foxglove Records, 2007)\nFrom Our Mouths a Perpetual Light (Not Not Fun Records, 2008)\nThe Conjurer (Root Strata, 2009)\nAncestral Star (Thrill Jockey, 2010)\nLost in the Glare (Thrill Jockey, 2011)\nV (Thrill Jockey, 2013)\n\n\n== References =="

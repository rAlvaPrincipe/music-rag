    "text": "The Island of Christianity: Armenia & Artsakh is 3-Disc set of Blu-ray, DVD and CD. It has been filmed in 2013 in Armenia and Artsakh during Montserrat Caballé's visit as homage to the 1700th anniversary of the adoption of Christianity. Special Guests: Vangelis, Brian May, Montserrat Martí. The Island of Christianity is Montserrat Caballe's last album.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMore than 1700 years ago, Armenia became the world's first Christian nation. That is why the most ancient churches and monasteries in the world, such as St. Etchmiadzin (Armenia, IV c.) and Amaras (Artsakh, V c.) are located in Armenia and Artsakh. In 2013, Montserrat Caballé visited many of these churches as homage to the 1700th anniversary of the adoption of Christianity. This collection, in its turn, is an act of homage to the great soprano for her anniversary on the part of the Armenian nation, a sign of profound admiration and gratitude.\n\n\n== Songs listing ==\n1.

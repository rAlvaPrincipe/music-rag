    "text": "The Hammonds Band, formerly also known as Hammonds Saltaire, YBS Band, Yorkshire Building Society Band, and Hammonds Sauce Works Band is a brass band originating from Yorkshire.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name of the band has often changed as sponsorship changed. The band was formed in 1855 under the name of Saltaire Band created by the mill owner Titus Salt. In 1946  the band was named Hammonds Sauce Band who came under the sponsorship of Hammonds Sauce Works in Shipley. They remained with this name for many years until Hammonds Sauce Works itself folded. In the early nineties Yorkshire Building Society started sponsoring the band and the name changed into Yorkshire Building Society Band. In 2004, however, the sponsorship ended and the band changed its name to YBS Band. There was a growing mood to change the name, and therefore the name was changed in January 2009 into \"Hammonds Saltaire Band\".  In 2021, the band decided to rebrand their name as Hammonds Band due to no longer being associated with Saltaire anymore.  The band now resides in Huddersfield.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nMany prizes have been won by the band including:\n\n European Brass Band Championships. Winner in 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004\n\n\n== Partial discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

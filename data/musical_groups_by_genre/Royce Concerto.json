    "text": "Royce Concerto is the second studio album by American classical pianist and composer Richard Kastle. It is also a three movement concerto for piano and orchestra, that was composed by Kastle and included in the album. The Philharmonia Orchestra also performs on the album released by Yum Recordings on September 30, 1997.\n\n\n== Concerto ==\nThis concerto was created after Kastle was invited to perform at UCLA’s Royce Hall. After the invitation, he went to work on some music designed especially for the venue and its difficult acoustics. By the time he finished the Royce Concerto and before the contracts were signed, organizers had changed their minds about booking him. He refused to change the name.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nIt was recorded by Virgin Records in 1992 using the same production team and studio as Streetwise. The piano was recorded and mixed a Minnesota Public radio, Studio M, St. Paul, MN.

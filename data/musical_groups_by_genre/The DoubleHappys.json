    "text": "The DoubleHappys (sometimes spelled Double Happys) were a New Zealand rock band based in Dunedin who short-lived but influential, and part of the Dunedin sound music wave of the 1980s.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed initially by former Bored Games members Shayne Carter and Wayne Elsey after the demise of Elsey's other band The Stones in 1983.\nThey employed an old and erratic drum machine (dubbed \"Herbie Fuckface\"). Herbie proved too erratic and it was not long before the duo opted to recruit former school friend John Collie to provide a more reliable rhythm section. They took part in the Flying Nun \"Looney Tour\" in February 1984, travelling around the country with various other bands, cutting a single, the \"Double B-side\" (\"The Other's Way\" and \"Anyone Else Would\"), in March.\nEarly in 1985, the band recorded an EP, Cut it Out and embarked on a short tour in June. Towards the end of the tour the band were travelling south from Auckland by train, and Elsey, in high spirits, climbed out of a carriage. The train passed under a bridge, killing Elsey instantly.\nThe two remaining members of the band decided not to continue with the name, but later formed the nucleus of Straitjacket Fits.\nA compilation CD Nerves which features the single, EP, and live tracks, was released in 1992.\n\"The Other's Way\" was covered by Melbourne, Australia band The Glory Box on their 1991 album Fudgeland.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles & EPs ===\nDouble B Side (7\" – 1984 – Flying Nun Records – FN026) #42\nCut It Out (12\" – 1985 – Flying Nun Records – FNDH002) #33\nHow Much Time Left, Please?

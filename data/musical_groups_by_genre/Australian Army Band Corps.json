    "text": "The Australian Army Band Corps (AABC) is the Australian Army's musical branch. It is roughly the equivalent of the Music Branch (Canadian Forces) and the Royal Corps of Army Music of the British Army. The Corps was formed on 2 August 1968 and provides the Army with musical support and seeks to improve the Army's public image. It consists of 11 individual bands; five full-time and six part-time which are located in the capital city of each state as well as the regional cities of Wagga Wagga, Townsville, and Newcastle.\nThe band’s mission is to support land operations and strategy through military and community engagement.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter World War II there was a need to make an assessment of the state of Army Bands. In 1951, Captain R.A. Newman was appointed the first Director of Music and in 1953 an Army School of Music was established to provide standardized formal training for Army musicians. Until 1961, Newman held the concurrent roles of Director of Music and Commanding Officer of the Army School of Music. In the 1960s focus centered on the conversion from brass band to military band instrumentation. First with the Band of the Royal Military College in 1964, all Regular Army bands were converted to this new format  by 1974. Prior to the formation of the (AABC), Army musicians were held on the Royal Australian Infantry Corps Special List. It was the ambition of senior band personnel to have the specialization of music recognized by the creation of a corps. This goal was realized on 2 August 1968 with the establishment of the AABC, the first of its type in the world. After the creation of the AABC, bands previously belonging to infantry battalions were reassigned to become area bands and were affiliated with particular host corps.\nThree of the now former bands were recognized by the granting of Freedom of Entry to their units:\n\n1MD Band (AAB Brisbane) – City of Brisbane in 1988\n1MD Band (AAB Brisbane) – City of Gold Coast in 1989\n1MD Band (AAB Brisbane) – Shire of Redland in 1989\n\n\n== Composition ==\nHeadquarters\nAustralian Army Band Tasmania\nAustralian Army Band Sydney\nBand of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment\nBand of the Royal Military College\nAustralian Army Band Perth\nAustralian Army Band Newcastle\nBand of the 1st Brigade (formerly Australian Army Band Darwin)\nAustralian Army Band Brisbane\nAustralian Army Band Kapooka\nAustralian Army Band Melbourne\nAustralian Army Band Adelaide\n\n\n== Former bands in the Army ==\nHistorical military bands in the AABC include:\n\nArmy School of Music (ASM)\nBand of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment\nBand of the 5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment\nSouthern Command Band\nEastern Command Band\nNorthern Command Band\nCentral Command Band\nWestern Command Band\nTasmanian Command Band\nBand of the Royal Australian Artillery\nBand of the Royal Australian Engineers\nBand of the Royal Australian Corps of Signals\nBand of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps\nAustralian Army Band Singapore\n1st Recruit Training Battalion Band\nNorth Queensland Army Band\n1st Military District Band\n2nd Military District Band\n3rd Military District Band\n4th Military District Band\n5th Military District Band\n6th Military District Band\n7th Military District Band\nBand of the 1st Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery\n\n\n== AABC Association ==\nThe AABC Association originated from an idea expressed at the  opening of the J.J. Shelton Band Centre at the Army Recruit Training Centre in March 1987.  The association organized its first meeting on 10 June 1989, during which it was formally established. Since then the association has held reunions throughout Australia every year, growing to be an organization parallel to the Returned and Services League of Australia.\nThe goals of the association include the following:\n\nThe communication between all former members of Army bands through personal contact and annual reunions\nTo foster the development of relations between former and current serving members of the AAVC.\nTo support the activities of the AABC\nThe AABC Association was incorporated in Victoria on 5 October 2004.

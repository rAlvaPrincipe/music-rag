    "text": "The Teenagers were a French synth-pop musical trio formed in late 2005, originally as a joke. They achieved some degree of notoriety with the song \"Homecoming\", both for its catchy sound and for its explicit content. Their debut album Reality Check was released in the UK on 17 March 2008 and 18 March 2008 in the rest of Europe and the United States. On October 12 2020, the band announced that they were no longer active and had not been for some time, and posted a link to a farewell song titled \"Do You Remember\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe NME praised the bands \"self-aware, smart sentiments, played out against a backdrop of lush, danceable, huggable pop.\"\nThey have been said to \"sound like Kraftwerk doing the soundtrack to a porno film\"\nTheir music is a mix of an electropop sound, comical lyrics and potent melodies. Their quirky fashion sense is inspired by the eccentric East London style, and copied by their cult fanbase. The track \"Homecoming\" was elected 4th best song of 2007 by NME.\nDuring 2008 The Teenagers toured the globe (25 countries, 100 cities) to promote their debut album \"Reality Check\". They played at the Reading Festival (UK), at Glastonbury (UK) and Summersonic (Japan) and have been invited as a support band by Vampire Weekend in the US and Europe.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nReality Check (2008)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nThe World Is Not Fair EP (2007)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Homecoming\" (2007)\n\"Starlett Johansson\" (2007)\n\"Fuck Nicole\" (US/Canada only release) (2008)\n\"Love No\" (2008)\n\"Make It Happen\" (2008)\n\"Made Of\" (2010)\n\"Secret Crush\" (2012)\n\"Do You Remember\" (2020)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nGoodBooks – \"The Illness\" (2007)\nLo-Fi-Fnk – \"City\" (2007)\nAu Revoir Simone – \"Fallen Snow\" (2007)\nThe Black Ghosts – \"Face\" (2007)\nAir – \"Mer Du Japon\" (2007)\nNew Young Pony Club – \"The Bomb\" (2007)\nShiny Toy Guns – \"Don't Cry Out\" (2007)\nChromeo – \"Bonafied Lovin\" (2007)\nScanners – \"Lowlife\"\nGoldfrapp – \"Happiness\" (2008)\nSimian Mobile Disco – \"It's the Beat\" (2008)\nVampire Weekend – \"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\" (2008)\nBritney Spears – \"Womanizer\" (2008)\nFall Out Boy – \"America's Suitehearts\" (2008)\nBlack Gold – \"Plans and Reveries\" (2008)\nPhoenix – \"1901\" (2009)\nAu Revoir Simone – \"Shadows\" (Unknown)\nKate Nash – \"Kiss That Grrrl\" (2010)\nAlizée – \"Les Collines (Never leave you)\" (2011)\nSolomun – \"Forever\" (2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Teenagers on Spoonfed\nThe Teenagers on Myspace\nDiscography on Discogs.com\nInterview at Comfortcomes"

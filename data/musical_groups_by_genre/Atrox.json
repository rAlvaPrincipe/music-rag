    "text": "Atrox is a Norwegian avant-garde metal band from Trondheim. The group originally formed under the name \"Suffocation\" but soon changed it because of numerous other bands with the same name. Formed in 1988, the band released its first material only in 1997, and followed it with two releases on notable French metal label, Season of Mist. While their early releases are firmly rooted in death metal, later releases incorporate more progressive elements.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\n-viNd- - guitars\nRune Sørgård - guitars, programming\nTor Arne Helgesen - drums\nErik Paulsen - bass\nRune Folgerø - lead vocals\nPer Spjøtvold - keyboard, backing vocals\n\n\n=== Former ===\nOle Marius Larmerud - guitars (2002–2005)\nMonika Edvardsen - vocals, keyboard (1996–2004)\nPete Beck - vocals, bass (2002–2004)\nDaniel Stavsøyen - bass (2001–2002)\nTom Wahl - bass (1999)\nDag Rune Øyan - guitars (1995–1999)\nLars Halvard Søndrol - drums (1994–1999)\nTommy Sebastian Halseth - bass (1995–1999)\nGeir Tore Johansen - vocals (1988–1997)\nSvenn Tore Mauseth  bass (1988–1995)\nTor-Helge Skei - guitars (1988–1994)\nTomas Smagersjø - drums (1993)\nGeir Knarrbakk - drums (1988–1992)\nGunder Audun Dragsten - guitars (1988–1990)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1997 Mesmerised (Head Not Found Records)\n2000 Contentum (Season of Mist)\n2002 Terrestrials (Season of Mist)\n2003 Orgasm (Code 666)\n2008 Binocular (Season of Mist)\n2017 Monocle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nInterview with Tor Arne Helgesen - English @ Metalfan.ro"

    "text": "Novo Combo was a power pop and new wave rock group, active in the early 1980s. Their initial lineup was Pete Hewlett, Stephen Dees, Jack Griffith, and drummer Michael Shrieve (formerly with Santana). The band had minor hits in 1981 with the songs \"Up Periscope\" and \"City Bound.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nLead singer and bassist Stephen Dees released a solo album for RCA Records called From the Hip in 1977 which was produced by Daryl Hall. He performed with many other acts from the 1980s including Hall and Oates as well as Tony Carey. He was also featured in the Tony Carey video of \"The First Day of Summer\". Dees would later form his own independent pop/art rock band Bandees in the late 1990s.\nLead guitarist Jack Griffith performed with Mick Jagger, Carlos Santana, and Gary Moore, in addition to penning songs for Warner Chappell, Fiona, and Revo Bop. Now he has his own Commercial Business Studio, where he records bands, and produces TV commercials.\nNovo Combo's singer and guitarist Pete Hewlett lives in Pittsburgh. He toured and recorded with Billy Joel, Carly Simon, Joe Jackson, Julian Lennon, Amy Grant, and Eric Carmen. Pete Hewlett got his first recording contract when he was 16 years old. His band Peter's Pipers won a battle of the bands' contest at West View Park that sent them onto the national finals and got them a deal with Philips Mercury Records.\nThen came a new band—Sweet Lightning—and the attention of RCA Records, where they recorded an LP and a pair of singles. Afterward, the band moved to Cleveland, where Pete recorded with Eric Carmen (Raspberries), then joined the Euclid Beach Band, for which Carmen made an appearance on their one-off self-titled album from 1979.\nA turning point came two years later when Hewlett's former Sweet Lightning bandmate Syd McGinness (guitarist for David Letterman) recommended Hewlett to Carly Simon, who was looking for a new backup singer. Hewlett got the job, moved to New York City, recorded \"Come Upstairs\" and headed out on tour with Simon.\nWhile in New York, Hewlett answered an audition with Stephen, Jack, and Michael and formed Novo Combo. They were signed to Polygram and put out two albums: Novo Combo in 1981  and The Animation Generation in 1982. In their review of The Animation Generation, GloryDazeMusic.com opined that \"the songs which stand out are the ones in which Pete Hewlett sings.\" Novo Combo toured with The Who, Cheap Trick, and Greg Lake and performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival '81.\nHewlett then worked with Billy Joel. Hewlett hit the road with Joel for the An Innocent Man and The Bridge world tours. Then came the tour that made international news: Billy Joel would bring a fully staged rock production to the Soviet Union as part of the Ronald Reagan-Mikhail Gorbachev 1985 Geneva summit. Hewlett performed with Joel in Moscow and Leningrad—and made history as part of the first live rock radio broadcast in Soviet history, which was also simulcast in the United States. The live double album, КОНЦЕРТ (translation: 'In Concert'), chronicled the trip.\nBack in the States, Hewlett recorded the Starlight Express Broadway soundtrack, Joe Jackson's Big World recording and U.S. Concert Tour, Julian Lennon's The Secret Value of Daydreaming album and Amy Grant's 1997 World Leader Summit performance. Most recently, Hewlett joined Billy Joel once again to perform at the \"Last Play at Shea\" concerts in July 2008.\nNOVO COMBO is presently working on a new Production Album, CD to be released Mid 2020.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

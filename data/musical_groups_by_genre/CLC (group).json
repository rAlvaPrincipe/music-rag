As of 2024, CLC only has member Eunbin active under the label.\nFrom 2020 onward, Cube halted CLC promotions and the members have embarked on individual music, acting, and modeling careers. On May 20, 2022, after being inactive for over a year and a half, Cube Entertainment announced that their \"official activities\" had ended, with their CLC U Cube global fansite service discontinued on June 6.

They also modeled for the uniform brand Smart, featuring in a promotional music video with the boy groups Got7 and B1A4. Before their official debut, the group began to gain publicity through street performances they held to raise money for children with disabilities. These featured on their web reality show, CLC's Love Chemistry.\n\n\n=== 2015: Debut and further EP releases ===\n\nCLC debuted in 2015 with a five-member lineup of Seunghee, Yujin, Seungyeon, Sorn, and Yeeun. They released their first EP First Love, including the lead single \"Pepe\", on March 19. Their debut showcase was held the day before at the Acts Hotel in Seoul, where they performed their debut song for the first time.

Cube Entertainment stated that Eunbin had originally been part of the group's original lineup, but was dropped following delays in production of the group's debut album. Due to Produce 101's contractual restrictions, Eunbin was prohibited from promoting the single \"High Heels\" on music shows or other broadcasts, nor appear in the single's music video. The agency planned for Eunbin to join promotions in the event that she was eliminated from the show, otherwise postponing her activities as part of the group until after Produce 101 promotions if she was a winner.

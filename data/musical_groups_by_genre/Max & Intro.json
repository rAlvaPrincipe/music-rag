    "text": "Max & Intro was a Yugoslav new wave and synth-pop band formed in 1982 by Max Vincent and Intro Johnnie.\n\n\n== History ==\nMax & Intro was founded in 1982 by Miodrag Miša Mihajlović, better known as Max Vincent, and his friend Zoran Ćalić, known as Intro Johnnie. They met while studying at the Stanković Musical School in Belgrade. Soon after the band was formed, they released their first single Ostavi sve, which immediately became a hit in Yugoslavia and established the duo as pioneers of minimalist synth-pop in the country throughout the 1980s.\nTheir first record We Design The Future was released in 1985 by the PGP RTB record label. The single contains two songs - Ostavi sve and Beogradska devojka, recorded in the studio Druga maca in Belgrade. Demo recordings of the two songs were on the top list of Prekobrojni čas, from where Sloba Konjović transferred them to Studio B, where Ostavi sve placed sixth and Beogradska devojka fourth on the list.\nAfter the release of We Design The Future, the duo had a series of guest television appearances and performed at various popular Belgrade venues, including performances at the Students' Cultural Centre, the Club of the Technical Faculties and guest appearances on television programmes Hit meseca and Petkom u 22.\nThe band broke up in 1987, as Vincent and Johnnie decided to pursue solo careers.\nThe Future Has Designed Us was released in 2016 as a compilation of songs recorded between 1984 and 2002. Three were recorded by Max & Intro, while the remaining seven are Vincent's solo work.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Rеferences ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMax & Intro at Last.fm\nMax & Intro at Discogs (list of releases)\nMax & Intro – Zaboravljeni prinčevi beogradske elektronike 80-tih (in Serbo-Croatian)"

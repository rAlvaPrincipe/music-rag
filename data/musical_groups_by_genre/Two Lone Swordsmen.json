    "text": "Two Lone Swordsmen were a British electronic music duo from London, consisting of Andrew Weatherall and Keith Tenniswood.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed by Andrew Weatherall and Keith Tenniswood in 1996, following the dissolution of Weatherall's the Sabres of Paradise, Two Lone Swordsmen released material on the record label Emissions Audio Output, run by Weatherall. However, the small nature of the operation limited the duo's success and they subsequently signed to Warp.\nTwo Lone Swordsmen's debut studio album, The Fifth Mission (Return to Flightpath Estate), was released in 1996. 1998's Stay Down was placed at number 22 on Pitchfork's \"50 Best IDM Albums of All Time\" list. Tiny Reminders (2000) was placed at number 19 on Pitchfork's \"Top 20 Albums of 2000\" list. The duo released From the Double Gone Chapel in 2004.\nOn 17 February 2020, Weatherall died due to a pulmonary embolism at the age of 56. Weatherall's death marked the end of Two Lone Swordsmen, as Tenniswood decided to fold the group.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nThe Fifth Mission (Return to Flightpath Estate) (Emissions Audio Output, 1996)\nStay Down (Warp, 1998)\nTiny Reminders (Warp, 2000)\nFrom the Double Gone Chapel (Warp, 2004)\nWrong Meeting (Rotters Golf Club, 2007)\nWrong Meeting II (Rotters Golf Club, 2007)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nFurther Reminders (Warp, 2001)\nPeppered with Spastic Magic: A Collection of Two Lone Swordsmen Remixes (RGC, 2003)\nEmissions Audio Output: From the Archive Vol/01 (RGC, 2006)\n\n\n=== Album-length EPs ===\nSwimming Not Skimming (Emissions Audio Output, 1996) – limited release\nStockwell Steppas (Emissions Audio Output, 1997) – limited release\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nThe Third Mission (Emissions Echoic, 1996)\nThe Tenth Mission (Emissions Audio Output, 1996)\nTwo Lone Swordsmen and a Being (Special Emissions, 1996) (with Being)\nThe Role of Linoleum (Humboldt County, 1997) (as Lino Squares)\nD.C.Fumes EP (New Emissions, 1997) (as Rude Solo)\nA Bag of Blue Sparks (Warp, 1998)\nA Virus with Shoes (Warp, 1999)\nReceive Tactical Support (Warp, 1999)\nKlunk (Subvert, 1999) (as Klunk)\nLocked Swords (Warp, 2001)\nBenicassim EP (RGC, 2001) (as Aramchek)\nFor Shavers Only (RGC, 2001) (as Klart)\nDark Eldar (Art of Perception, 2001) (as Rude Solo)\nBig Silver Shining Motor of Sin E.P.

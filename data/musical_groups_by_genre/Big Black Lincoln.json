    "text": "Big Black Lincoln was a Canadian rhythm and blues musical group from Toronto, Ontario, active in the mid-2000s. Led by rapper Saukrates, the group included musicians T.R.A.C.K.S., Agile, Ro Dolla and Shakari Nyte.\nAfter realizing that some of the songs he was writing weren't fitting in on his rap-oriented albums, Saukrates launched the band as a side project. The group released the single \"Pimpin' Life\" in 2003, receiving a Juno Award nomination for R&B/Soul Recording of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2004. They followed up with the full-length album Heaven's Caught on Fire in 2006. The album went on to be recognized as an important influence on Toronto's R&B and hip hop scenes in the later 2000s and 2010s.\n\n\n== References =="

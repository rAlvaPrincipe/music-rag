    "text": "Schnell Fenster were a New Zealand rock band formed in Melbourne, Australia in 1986 by Noel Crombie on drums and percussion, Nigel Griggs on bass guitar and backing vocals, Phil Judd on lead vocals and guitar, and Eddie Rayner on keyboards and piano – who were all former members of New Zealand-formed rock group, Split Enz. Fellow founder, Michael den Elzen on lead guitar had worked with Tim Finn Band, another band formed by a Split Enz alumnus. Judd's band were briefly named The Wanx: but Rayner soon left and they changed their name to faux-German for \"quick window\", because it \"appealed to [their] perversity\". The group formed the core members of Noel's Cowards, a short-term ensemble, whose sole output was six tracks for the soundtrack of a feature film, Rikky and Pete, in 1988. Schnell Fenster released two studio albums, The Sound of Trees (1988) and Ok Alright a Huh Oh Yeah (1990), before disbanding in 1992. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1989 they were nominated for Breakthrough Artist – Album for The Sound of Trees, Breakthrough Artist – Single for \"Whisper\" and Best Cover Art for Judd's graphic art.\n\n\n== History ==\nSchnell Fenster (schnelles Fenster is German for \"fast window\") were formed in Melbourne as a pop, rock group in 1986 by Noel Crombie on drums and percussion (ex-Split Enz, the Slaughtermen), Michael den Elzen on lead guitar (ex-Broderick Smith Band, Tim Finn Band, Stephen Cummings Band), Nigel Griggs on bass guitar and backing vocals (ex-Octopus, Steve Hillage's Khan [both in England], Split Enz), Phil Judd on lead vocals and guitar (ex-Split Enz, Suburban Reptiles, the Swingers) and Eddie Rayner on keyboards and piano (ex-Orb, Split Enz, Space Waltz). Rayner left soon after its formation to join the Rock Party and later was a touring member of Crowded House – another Split Enz-related group. The band's name is from \"the nickname given to an experimental steam locomotive built in the 1930s. It reached incredible speeds but was declared unsafe.\"\nLaurence Boswell of The Canberra Times interviewed Crombie in August 1987; Boswell asserted, \"For me, Noel personified the intersection of music and art on the fringe. He was an essential ingredient of the Split Enz magic – in sound, performance and image. His percussion was\nperfection, his spoon solos bedazzled, and those haircuts and clothes!\" For Crombie the group \"began as a kind of a hobby — 'an enthusiasts' band'. As rehearsals developed the music into full-fledged songs, the decision was made to work towards recording an album. Live gigs will be a rarity until the album is released.\" He continued, \"after a year, we're keen to get into a studio. We've got a lot of songs together and we're keen to get them recorded.\"\nIn August 1987 Crombie indicated they were working on the soundtrack for a feature film, Rikky and Pete (1988). Rayner was \"working on the film as well, doing the underscore.\" (see The Makers) Noel's Cowards, formed as a studio-only ensemble, consisted of the extant Schnell Fenster members, plus Wendy Matthews (vocals), Michael Harris (fiddle), Louis McManus (mandolin), Vika Bull and Lisa Edwards (backing vocals). They provided six \"country-tinged\" tracks for Rikky and Pete and the related single, \"Fingers Crossed\", in 1988. Schnell Fenster's track, \"Run a Mile\", was also used on the soundtrack.\nSchnell Fenster released their debut studio album, The Sound of Trees, in September 1988 via EMI Records/Warner Music Australasia for the Australasian market and Atlantic Records, internationally. The music was composed by all four members with lyrics written by Judd. They had signed with EMI in January of that year after, \"it became evident that actual songs were emerging from these [jam] sessions, the band started recording demo tapes.\" The album was co-produced by the group with English producers, Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley, at Platinum Studios, Melbourne. It peaked in the ARIA top 100.\nAnother The Canberra Times reporter, Kathryn Whitfield opined that the album's, \"music is bizarre, though not extraordinary. It is similar in parts to those weird wonders produced by the Cure. These off-beat ditties are all over the place like a dog's dinner, with synthesised gurgles crashing about the seemingly opium-induced lyrics... coupled with the high-pitched whining vocals of Judd, it is more than one person should have to bear.\"\nBoswell and Whitfield's fellow journalist, Amanda Lynch, described the group's debut single, \"Whisper\" (August), which \"has a subtle Split Enz feel to it but in general, the music of Schnell Fenster is very different. It lacks the clarity and energetic enthusiasm that was the Split Enz trademark.\" \"Whisper\" peaked in top 60 in Australia and top 50 in New Zealand.\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 1989 the group were nominated for Breakthrough Artist – Album for The Sound of Trees, Breakthrough Artist – Single for \"Whisper\" and Best Cover Art for Judd's graphic art. The album had provided two further singles, \"Love-Hate Relationship\" (late 1988) and \"This Illusion\" (1989). The band performed across Australia to promote their material and then toured New Zealand in 1989, as a support act for Crowded House. Renewed interest in Split Enz had led to an American album release later that year, but with no tour and little record company support, it did not chart there.\nSchnell Fenster's second album, Ok Alright a Huh Oh Yeah, was released in 1990. It was produced by the group and included Venetta Fields on backing vocals. They had recorded it at Metropolis Music and Effects Platinum, Atlanta. AllMusic's Chris Woodstra observed, \"Though the songs aren't quite as strong as those on the debut [album, it] is still a solid, well produced effort, worthwhile for longtime Split Enz fans.\" Crombie's worsening tinnitus led to cessation of touring, and Schnell Fenster disbanded in 1992. Woodstra related how former members were, \"playing a more active role behind the scenes in the music business.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nSchnell Fenster\nNoel Crombie – drums and percussion (1986–92)\nMichael den Elzen – lead guitar, guitar synth, fretless guitar, keyboards (1986–92)\nNigel Griggs – bass guitar, backing vocals (1986–92)\nPhil Judd – guitar, trumpet, keyboards, lead vocals (1986–92)\nEddie Rayner – keyboards, piano (1986)\nNoel's Cowards\nVika Bull – backing vocals (1988)\nNoel Crombie – drums (1988)\nMichael den Elzen – guitar (1988)\nLisa Edwards – backing vocals (1988)\nNigel Griggs – bass guitar (1988)\nMichael Harris – violin (1988)\nPhil Judd – guitar (1988)\nWendy Matthews – lead vocals (1988)\nLouis McManus – mandolin (1988)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Other appearances ===\nRikky and Pete (soundtrack, 1988): – \"Run a Mile\" (by Schnell Fenster); \"Fingers Crossed\", \"Cold Shoulder\", \"In the Dark\", \"Tears of Joy\", \"Just Like You\", \"Hard to Believe\" (by Noel's Cowards).\nSweetie (soundtrack, 1989): – \"Whisper\", \"This Illusion\", \"That's Impossible\" (by Schnell Fenster)\nThe Big Steal (soundtrack, 1990): – \"Fun City\" (by Schnell Fenster)\nVarious Artists: Other Enz: Split Enz & Beyond (compilation album, 1999): – \"Fingers Crossed\", \"Just Like You\", \"Cold Shoulder\" (by Noel's Cowards with Wendy Matthews); \"Whisper\", \"Ok Alright a Huh Oh Yeah\" (by Schnell Fenster)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== ARIA Music Awards ===\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music.

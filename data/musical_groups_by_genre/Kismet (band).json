    "text": "Kismet were an Australian darkwave band, formed in 1993 by Macedonian immigrant and ex-Mizar guitarist Gorazd Chapovski after that band's breakup in 1991 and his relocation to Australia shortly after.\n\n\n== History ==\nKismet were formed in 1993 by Chapovski. His Mizar bandmate Ilija Stojanovski joined him on bass. The band's first three recordings were \"The Fog\" (an English-language remake of the Mizar song \"Magla\"), \"Heaven in Asia\" and \"Sister Tonight\", all featuring Australian vocalist Kerry Smith. The latter two songs were released at the end of 1993 on the Fresh Tracks Series 14 compilation in Australia, while \"The Fog\" remained unreleased until a 2003 reissue of Mizar's album Svjat Dreams 1762-1991, where it was incorrectly listed as the \"last Mizar song\". \"Heaven in Asia\" would be released on Macedonian Document, Step 1, a compilation of Macedonian alternative rock music, in 1994.\nThe group released their first EP, Dormant Dire, in 1994, followed by a full-length, Damjan's War, in 1995. In 1997, they signed to the Tone Casualties label in the US, releasing an album, Wake Up Gods shortly after. In 1999, the group released the North Atlantic Balkan Express album, which had used working titles \"The Tank\" and \"Black General\". That year, they moved back to Macedonia, contributing two tracks to a tribute album to Mizar and coordinating the project. They got a Macedonian record deal with Avalon Produkcija, releasing the Dreaming LP in 2002.\nThe band broke up that year and Chapovski reconvened Mizar.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (last updated in 2000)\nKismet at Discogs"

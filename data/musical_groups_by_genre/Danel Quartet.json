    "text": "The Danel Quartet (or Quatuor Danel) is a French/Belgian string quartet established in June 1991. Known for classical, early modern and contemporary repertoire, they tour internationally and have an extensive discography. They have both recorded and performed the first complete cycle of string quartets by Mieczysław Weinberg and have undertaken a complete cycle of the quartets of Dmitri Shostakovich as well.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ensemble has worked with the Amadeus Quartet. For Shostakovich's complete string quartets, it worked with the Borodin Quartet and Fyodor Druzhinin of the Beethoven Quartet and also with Pierre Penassou and Walter Levin, both members of the LaSalle Quartet. The Danel Quartet performs the classical repertoire as well as contemporary music. They are specialized in the Russian repertoire. Their recordings of Shostakovich's and Weinberg's quartets (world premiere) are a reference.\nSince 2005, the Danel Quartet has been \"Quartet in Residence\" at the University of Manchester, and since 2016, in residence at TivoliVredenburg, Utrecht. From 2019 to 2021, they were in residence at the Wigmore Hall for a complete double of Shostakovich and Weinberg's string quartets.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMarc Danel - first violin (since 1991)\nGilles Milet - second violin (since 1991)\nVlad Bogdanas - viola (since 2005)\nYovan Markovitch - cello (since 2013)\n\n\n== Premieres ==\nOlivier Greif, String quartet No 2 (1996)\nKrzysztof Meyer, String quartet No 14 « Au-delà de l'absence » (1998)\nAlexander Raskatov, Gebet for soprano and String quartet (1998)\nBruno Mantovani, les fées string quartet\nBruno Mantovani, Quintet with harp\nBruno Mantovani, Quintet with 2 cellos\nWolfgang Rihm, Sextet for clarinet, horn and string quartet\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDmitri Shostakovich - complete string quartets (October 2001–June 2005, 5CD Fuga libera FUG512 / Alpha) OCLC 811455133\nPeter Swinnen, Lydia Chagoll - La vieille dame et la fille nomade (Artist consultancy DIS 001)\nAhmet Adnan Saygun - complete string quartets (1–4 December 2003/20-22 September/19 November 2004, 2CD CPO 999 923-2) OCLC 315127627\nHao-Fu Zhang - Qia-Xiao (June 2002/May 2003/February 2004, Cypres CYP4617) OCLC 228475722\nFelix Mendelssohn - String quartets, op. 44, No 1 and 2 (Eufoda 1355)\nPascal Dusapin, René Koering - String quartets (May 2003, Accord 476 1919) OCLC 60819508\nElmar Lampson - Fadenkreuze (Col Legno 20 234) OCLC 237881188\nAdolphe Biarent - Quintet with piano (Cypres CYP4611)\nAndré Souris - Musics (Cypres CYP4610)\nBenoît Mernier - Les idées heureuses (1997/2001, Cypres CYP4613) OCLC 56563794\nPatrick De Clerck - Chamber music (May/June 1994, Megadisc MDC 7866) OCLC 37838806\nCharles Gounod - String quartets (January 1997, Auvidis V4798) OCLC 38553717\nManuel Rosenthal - Chamber music (1996, Calliope, Karel Goeyvaerts - Chamber music (December 1995/January 1996, Megadisc MDC 7853) OCLC 35308811\nNicolas Bacri - Chamber music (REM 311 276XCD)\nAlexandre Raskatov - Chamber music (Megadisc MDC 7825)\nMieczysław Weinberg - complete string quartets (CPO) — World premieres of quartets 3, 4 and 6.\nCésar Franck - quartets and quintets with piano with Paavali Jumppanen (CPO).\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPâris, Alain (2004).

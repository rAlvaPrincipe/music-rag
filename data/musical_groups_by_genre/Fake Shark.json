    "text": "Fake Shark (formerly known as Fake Shark – Real Zombie!) is a Canadian alternative rock band from Vancouver, British Columbia. Originally formed in 2005, while their early musical style mainly combined elements of dance punk, post-hardcore and IDM, the group gradually evolved to a more commercially streamlined sound in 2015, within the realm of indie rock, electro pop, new wave and slacker rock. They are best known for their 2021 hit single, \"Loser\", which charted to #3 on the Canadian alternative radio and are currently signed to Canadian independent label, Light Organ Records.\nThe band's current line-up consists of founding members and primary songwriters; lead vocalist, Kevin \"Kevvy\" Maher, guitarist, Louis Hearn (under the stage name, \"Louis Wu\") along with drummer, Alex Glassford, and multi-instrumentalist, Jake Fox. As \"Fake Shark\", the group have released three studio albums via Light Organ; Faux Real (2017), Time for the Future (2021) and their most recent, Afterglow on January 12. 2024.\nOver the course of their career, Fake Shark have toured extensively across North America, Asia, The United Kingdom and Europe, and have shared the stage and collaborated with the likes of artists, such as Mindless Self Indulgence, Hot Hot Heat, Klaxons, Die Mannequin, Annie Hardy, Hannah Georgas, Kool Keith, The Darcys, and The Glorious Sons to name a few. Additionally, their music has also been featured in a number of high-profile commercial and television placements, such as Apple, Famous in Love, Love Island, MTV's Catfish, The NHL's Hockey Night in Canada on Sportsnet and NFL Monday Night Football.\n\n\n== History ==\nFake Shark was conceived by producer/songwriters, Kevin \"Kevvy Mental\" Maher and Louis Wu in September 2005, as a way of combining the styles of the bands they liked in hopes to one day open for them. Having met while attending a fine arts high school in Langley, British Columbia, the pair formed \"Fake Shark – Real Zombie!\" shortly after graduation, and recruiting original bassist, Dan Hughes and drummer, Malcolm Holt to complete the lineup. The band's original name, being a reference to Lucio Fulci's 1979 horror film Zombi 2, where a real shark and a zombie engage in combat. The group would quickly gain a cult following online and overseas after making strong connections in the United Kingdom and touring with short-lived British dance-punk band, Test Icicles (featuring a then unknown Dev Hynes), and eventually end up joining them on stage during their infamous final show on April 22. 2006 at the famed Astoria Theatre in London, England following their announced break-up a few months prior.\nIn 2007, Hughes would leave the band and be replaced by musician and songwriter, Parker Bossley who would go on to join Canadian indie rock band, Hot Hot Heat concurrently the following year. The onslaught of MySpace buzz garnered the interest of Japanese record label, Vinyl Junkie who released the band's debut album, Zebra! Zebra! on April 25, 2007. The album was met with critical acclaim and commercial fanfare, (including life-sized cut-outs of the band's members at HMV stores in Tokyo) with media outlets likening them as the Canadian answer to American post-hardcore band, The Blood Brothers and \"Fake Shark – Real Zombie!\" would tour internationally to sold-out dates and festival appearances between Japan, the UK and North America in support of the album  and further garnered the group even more considerable exposure to a bigger audience and high-profile fans including, former Black Flag singer, Henry Rollins, who named Fake Shark – Real Zombie! as \"one of his favorite new bands\" and would play the band several times on his Indie 103.1 FM radio show, Harmony in My Head.\nDuring Summer 2008, the band would enter the studio with Canadian music producer, Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie (known for his work with Skinny Puppy, Jakalope, Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails) to  work on their next record. The result would be the band's second studio album, Meeting People Is Terrible, released August 26, 2009 via Vinyl Junkie in Japan. A sophomore effort just as eclectic as their first, expanding their brand of genre-bending post-hardcore to even more styles, such as funk and industrial. The album was preceded by lead single, Angel Lust, which was released as an EP on January 9, 2009, containing three additional tracks from the subsequent record, that served as a preview before its release. All the songs on the EP would later go on to be included in the music video game, Rock Band 2 as downloadable content in the game's online, Rock Band Network launched initially on Mar 4. 2010 via Xbox 360. The band would also release a cover of \"Sour Times by the British trip-hop band, Portishead, on their MySpace page soon after as a stand-alone single.\nIn 2012, Fake Shark – Real Zombie! signed to Canadian record label, Light Organ Records, a subsidiary of 604 Records run by entertainment lawyer, Jonathan Simkin and local musician and friend of the band, Tony Dallas would join the group as their new bassist, (following the departures of Bossley and Holt from the group in 2010). On September 18, 2012, Fake Shark – Real Zombie! premiered \"Girls\", the first single off their next album featuring Hot Hot Heat's lead singer, Steve Bays. The single marked a considerable shift in the band's sound, moving away from the post-hardcore styling of their early material into a new territory of off-kilter pop for the group, which set the tone for their third studio album, Liar released February 14, 2014 via Light Organ and Universal Music Group.\nThe album's expansive list of producers and collaborators included Bays, Dave Ogilvie, Henry Rollins, Greig Nori, Jimmy Urine, Care Failure of Die Mannequin, Adaline, Japanese Voyeurs, and The Birthday Massacre.

Following its release, Fake Shark – Real Zombie! toured across parts of North America, Europe and Asia throughout 2013 into the next year, including serving as a support act, along with 604 Records artist, Jessica Lee for Marianas Trench guitarist, Matt Webb's 2014 Canadian tour in promotion of his second EP, \"The Right Direction\" during Spring 2014.

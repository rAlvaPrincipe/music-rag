    "text": "Musica Elettronica Viva (MEV) is a live acoustic/electronic improvisational group formed in Rome, Italy, in 1966. Defined as \"something of an irregular institution, a band that has come together intermittently through the years\", Musica Elettronica Viva's founding members were Allan Bryant, Alvin Curran, Jon Phetteplace and Frederic Rzewski, Richard Teitelbaum. and Carol Plantamura. Other members include Ivan Vandor and Steve Lacy. Garrett List and George E. Lewis subsequently joined the group.\nMusica Elettronica Viva were early experimenters in the use of synthesizers. A 1967 performance in Berlin featured a rendition of John Cage's Solo for Voice 2 with Plantamura's voice transformed through a Moog synthesizer. At the end of the 1960s, they took part in the group Lo Zoo, founded by artist Michelangelo Pistoletto. They also used such \"non-musical\" objects as amplified panes of glass and motor oil cans.\nTheir performances achieved mainstream notoriety in Italy for generating vocal audience participation, occasionally resulting in riots, for example at the Musee d'Art Moderne in Paris, at Queen Anne's Hall in London where the police and the fire department kicked the group out, and at the Teatro Regio in Parma where the authorities shut the house lights down and emptied the hall, inspiring a street demonstration led by Jean-Jacques Lebel.\nMusica Elettronica Viva disbanded in 2017 after a final tour, though at least two CDs were released subsequently. Among the many who performed with the group, Jon Phetteplace died decades ago, Steve Lacy in 2004, Maryanne Amacher in 2009, Garrett List in 2019, Ivan Vandor and Richard Teitelbaum in 2020, and Frederic Rzewski in 2021. \n\n\n== Discography ==\nSpacecraft, recorded in Cologne in 1967 by Bryant, Curran, Rzewski, Teitelbaum and Vandor\nUnified Patchwork Theory, recorded in Zurich in 1990 by Curran, Rzewski, Teitelbaum, Steve Lacy, and Garrett List\nBoth of the above first issued in 2001 on CD as \"Spacecraft/Unified Patchwork Theory\" (Alga Marghen, Plana-M 15NMN.038).\n\nFriday, recorded in London in 1969 by Curran, Rzewski, Teitelbaum, Franco Cataldi and Gunther Carius, reissued 2008 (ALGA 073CD)\nThe Sound Pool, recorded 1969, reissued 1998 (Spalax CD14969)\nUnited Patchwork, recorded November 1977 in Rome by Curran, Rzewski, Teitelbaum, Lacy, List, and Karl Berger (Horo 2xLP HDP 15-16)\nMEV 40, recorded 1967–2007, a 4-CD set of previously unpublished performances issued by New World Records in 2008 (CD80675)\nApogee, a double CD (Matchless Recordings, MRCD61, 2005) shared with another of the electronic improvisational ensembles that emerged during the 1960s: AMM.

    "text": "Trampled Under Foot was an American soul blues and blues rock band. The original trio consisted of the siblings Danielle Schnebelen (lead vocals and bass), Nick Schnebelen (guitars and vocals) and Kris Schnebelen (drums and vocals).\nTheir 2013 album, Badlands, reached number one on the US Billboard Top Blues Albums Chart. Living Blues named the album in the top twenty of their recommended collections of 2013.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTrampled Under Foot was formed in Kansas City, Missouri in 2000. The trio's father, Bob, played blues guitar with a local band named Little Eva, and introduced the threesome to some of their jamming sessions. Between 1999 and 2004, Danielle was originally in a musical outfit known as Fresh Brew, whilst her brother Kris played in various local blues groups. Nick was a brief member of both K-Floor and Buddahead.\nOnce they were together under the Trampled Under Foot name, their self-titled debut album was released in 2006. The Philadelphia Sessions  followed in 2007. May I Be Excused (2008) and Wrong Side of the Blues (2011) were sandwiched either side of their live album, Live at Notodden Blues Festival (2010).\nThe constant exposure and touring led them in 2013 to signing a recording contract with Telarc, who released Badlands the same year. Tony Braunagel produced both Wrong Side of the Blues and Badlands.\nIn early 2014, Kris Schnebelen left the band and was replaced by Jan Faircloth and Mike Sedovic.\nTrampled Under Foot supported George Thorogood in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on May 17, 2014.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nTrampled Under Foot was the winner of the International Blues Challenge in 2008.\nAt the 2014 Blues Music Awards, Trampled Under Foot's album, Badlands, won the 'Contemporary Blues Album of the Year' category. At the same ceremony, Danielle Schnebelen triumphed in the 'Best Instrumentalist – Bass' category. The band was also nominated in the 'Band of the Year' category.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nDanielle Schnebelen (bass guitar, lead vocals) - (born Danielle Nicole Schnebelen, July, 20) - (2000–2015)\nKris Schnebelen (drums, vocals) - (born Kristopher R Schnebelen, May 2, 1980) - (2000–2014)\nNick Schnebelen (guitars, vocals) - (born Nicholas R Schnebelen, September 30, 1978) - (2000–2015)\nJan Faircloth (drums) - (2014–2015)\nMike \"Shinetop\" Sedovic (keyboards) - (2014–2015)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

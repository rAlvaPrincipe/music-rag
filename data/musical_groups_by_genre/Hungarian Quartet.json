    "text": "The Hungarian String Quartet was a musical ensemble of world renown, particularly famous for its performances of quartets by Beethoven and Bartók.  The quartet was founded in Budapest in 1935 (as the New Hungarian Quartet) and was disbanded in 1972.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe Quartet was originally brought together when two students of Jenő Hubay – Sándor Végh on violin and Dénes Koromzay on viola – as well as violinist Zoltán Székely and violoncellist Pál Hermann, were recruited in 1937. At that point Sándor Végh moved to the second violin desk, and in 1940 he left to found the Végh Quartet. He was then replaced by the Russian Alexandre Moszkowsky. The Quartet had made its debut in 1935, and met with swift success. Szekely was a friend of Béla Bartók's, and the group became rapidly known by giving the Hungarian première performance of the Bartok 5th Quartet, which it studied with the composer. By 1938, the group had been heard in every major city of Western Europe.\nDuring the war they were trapped in the Netherlands, and devoted the period to the intensive study of the Beethoven quartets, which were subsequently launched upon the world in the brilliant career which the group achieved after 1945. In 1950 they settled in the USA. In around 1956 the cello, and around 1960 the second violin desk, was reassigned, and in this new form the Quartet continued to maintain its busy programme of performance until 1972, while also undertaking teaching positions and the coaching of younger instrumentalists.  In 1957, the newly configured Quartet performed in Boston for the Peabody Mason Concert series.  In 1958 the quartet completed a Southern Africa tour, much appreciated by the local audience \nIn the 1966 issue recordings of the Beethoven cycle, it is stated that Székely plays the 'Michelangelo' Stradivarius (1718), Kuttner plays the 'Santa Theresa' Petrus Guarnerius (1704), Koromzay plays a 1766 instrument by M. Decanet, and Magyar has a cello by Alessandro Gagliano of 1706.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Recordings ==\n(Examples)\n\nSchubert: Quartet in D minor 'Death and the Maiden' D 810 (Nixa LP CLP 1152) (About 1952).\nSchubert: Quartet in D minor 'Death and the Maiden' D 810 (Vox LP STPL 512.520).\nSchubert: Quartet in C major D 887 (Columbia CX 1566) (EMG review Sep 1958).\nSchubert: Quintet in A major D 667 'The Trout' with Louis Kentner, Georg Hörtnagel (Vox STPL 512.690).\nSchumann: Quintet in E flat major op 44, with George Solchany, piano.

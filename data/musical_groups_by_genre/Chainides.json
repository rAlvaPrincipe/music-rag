    "text": "Hainides (Greek: Χαΐνηδες) is a Cretan folk music group who are inspired by\nthe vast legacy of traditional Cretan music and whose lyrics borrow words\nfrom the Cretan Greek dialect. The group's name is the plural of the word haínis\n(Greek: χαΐνης), meaning the fugitive rebel.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was formed in March 1990 by a group of friends, namely Dimitris Apostolakis, Dimitris Zacharioudakis, Giorgos Laodikis, Miltos Pashalidis and Kallia Spyridaki. Most of\nthem were then students at the University of Crete. Their discographical debut was in\n1991 with the album Hainides that was warmly received by the public. Hainides\nrapidly grew to seven members and released three more albums before being temporarily\ndissolved in 1997. One year later, Dimitris Apostolakis and Dimitris Zaharioudakis\nreinstated the group that was joined by the new members Maria Koti, Alexis Nonis,\nPeriklis Tsoukalas and Antonis Skamnakis. \nOver the years, Hainides have collaborated with several well-known musicians and singers.\nThey have performed in several locations both in Greece and abroad and have recorded seven\nstudio albums.\n\n\n== Group Members ==\nDimitris Apostolakis - Cretan lyra, vocals\nDimitris Zaharioudakis - acoustic guitar, vocals\nAngeliki Syrkou - vocals\nMihalis Nikopoulos - mandolin, bouzouki, laouto\nPeter Jaques - trumpet, clarinet, ney\nMihalis Galanis - drums\nGiorgos Konstantinou - bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1991 - Χαΐνηδες (Chainides)\n1993 - Κόσμος κι όνειρο είναι ένα (Kosmos ki oniro ine ena)\n1994 - Με κόντρα τον καιρό (Me kontra ton kero)\n1997 - Το μεγάλο ταξίδι (To megalo taxidi)\n2000 - Ο ξυπόλητος πρίγκηπας (O xipolitos prigipas), double album\n2002 - Δελτίο ειδήσεων (Deltio idiseon), 3 songs\n2005 - Ο γητευτής και το δρακοδόντι (O giteftis kai to drakodonti), double album\n2007 - Ο Καραγκιόζης στη Γιουροβίζιον (O Karagiozis stin Eurovision)\n2008 - Η κάθοδος των Σαλτιμπάγκων (I kathodos ton Saltimpagon)\n2011 - Αγροκτηνοτροφικά και Μητροπολιτικά (Agroktinotrofika & Mitropolitika), double album\n\n\n== Impact ==\nHainides have treated the Cretan music tradition with love and respect,\nconsidering it as something very much alive rather than a thing of a gone past. \nThe group's success is considered to have paved the road for other young artists\nto embrace the Cretan music tradition and attempt to enrich it with new elements.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreek folk music\nCretan music\n\n\n== External links ==\nHainides official web site\nHainides in mySpace"

    "text": "Yuzu (ゆず) is a Japanese pop rock duo who debuted in 1997. Its members are Yūjin Kitagawa (北川悠仁, Kitagawa Yūjin) and Kōji Iwasawa (岩沢厚治, Iwasawa Kōji). Both of the band members come from Yokohama in Kanagawa Prefecture, and attended \nOkamura Junior High School. Their songs \"Hyōri Ittai\" (表裏一体, Two sides of the same coin), \"Reason\", and \"Nagareboshi Kirari\" (流れ星キラリ, Shooting star) were used as ending themes of the anime series Hunter × Hunter (2011).\nYuzu started out as street musicians. At first, the band's name was \"Light's\", but Kitagawa disliked it, so they changed the name to \"Yuzu\". At that time, Kitagawa was eating a yuzu sherbet, so he named the band after the fruit. The fans of Yuzu are called \"Yuzukko (ゆずっ子)\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nYūjin Kitagawa (born January 14, 1977) – vocals, guitar, leader\nKōji Iwasawa (born October 14, 1976) – vocals, guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\n\n\n==== Mini albums ====\n\n\n==== Live albums ====\n\n\n==== Compilation albums ====\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\"—\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released in that region.\n\"×\" denotes periods where charts did not exist or were not archived.\n\n\n==== Collaboration singles ====\n\n\n== Asia Tours ==\nYUZU ASIA TOUR 2016 Summer 「NATSUIRO」 supported by WAKUWAKU JAPAN (2016)\nYUZU ASIA TOUR 2017 (2017)\nYUZU ASIA LIVE 2019 (2019)\n\n\n== Awards ==\nJapan Record Awards\n\nThe Japan Record Awards is a major music awards show held annually in Japan by the Japan Composer's Association.\n\nSpace Shower Music Video Awards\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website (in Japanese)\nYuzu at AllMusic\nYuzu  at Anime News Network's encyclopedia\nToy's Factory official profile (in Japanese)\nAvex Taiwan profile (in Chinese)"

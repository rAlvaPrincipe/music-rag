    "text": "38 Special, often stylized as .38 Special or spelled out as Thirty-eight Special, is an American rock band formed by singer-guitarists Donnie Van Zant and Don Barnes in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1974.\nThey are known for their hit songs, including \"Hold On Loosely\" and \"Caught Up in You\", among various other Top 40 hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 during the 1980s and early 1990s, including \"Rockin' into the Night\", \"You Keep Runnin' Away\", \"If I'd Been the One\", \"Back Where You Belong\", \"Teacher, Teacher\", \"Like No Other Night\", \"Second Chance\" and \"The Sound of Your Voice\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nDonnie Van Zant, the younger brother of Lynyrd Skynyrd co-founder and frontman Ronnie Van Zant, began playing music during his teen years, forming a band called Standard Production in 1968, which paved the way for Sweet Rooster, Donnie's first professional group that he formed in 1969 with guitarist Jeff Carlisi and bassist Ken Lyons, soon joined by drummer Steve Brookins. Carlisi left Sweet Rooster after graduating high school to study architecture at Georgia Tech and was replaced by Don Barnes in 1970. Brookins also left to work as a truck driver and Sweet Rooster was defunct by 1973.\nVan Zant, Barnes and Lyons, while continuing their day jobs and working in other bands, began composing original songs. By 1974, they decided to form \"the ultimate band\" that would be their \"one last shot\" at success. Briefly, Van Zant was considering a higher-paying position for the railroad at which he worked, but was finally convinced by brother Ronnie to stick with music since it was \"in his blood\".\nThe new group comprised Van Zant, Barnes, Lyons, Brookins, second drummer Jack Grondin and a returning Carlisi. The band's name was thought up after an incident which found the boys practicing in a warehouse out in the middle of nowhere. When police arrived after being notified by locals of the noise, the band members were unable to come out because of a padlock on the door. One of the cops said, \"That's all right. We'll let this .38 special do the talking\", and shot off the lock.\nNow that they had their name, the group spent most of 1975 and 1976 playing a steady grind of one-nighters, mostly in the South and the Midwest. Eventually, big brother Ronnie figured Donnie and the gang had paid enough dues and set them up with Skynryd's manager Peter Rudge, who also handled the Who and was tour manager for the Rolling Stones. Rudge quickly set the group up to open shows for popular acts such as Peter Frampton, Foghat and Kiss, and got them signed to A&M Records, who assigned Dan Hartman (of Edgar Winter Group fame) to produce their first album, .38 Special, which was released in May 1977.\nJust before the record's release, bassist Ken Lyons decided to leave the band. He was replaced by their friend and original Lynyrd Skynyrd member Larry Junstrom.\nAlso in 1977, the band added two female backup singers, Carol Bristow and Dale Krantz. Krantz was replaced by Nancy Henderson (1979–1981), Lu Moss (1981–1984) and then Lynn Hineman (1986–1987), before backup singers were dispensed with in 1987.\nIn October 1977, Ronnie Van Zant was killed when Skynyrd's plane crashed. Donnie wrote \"Take Me Back\" as a tribute to his brother, which appeared on the band's second album, Special Delivery (March 1978), also produced by Hartman.\n\n\n=== 1980–1999 ===\nThe band's first two albums had a strong Southern rock influence. By the early 1980s, .38 Special had shifted to a more accessible guitar-driven arena rock style without completely abandoning the Southern rock roots. This shift helped to usher in a string of successful albums and singles. Engineer Rodney Mills, who had worked with Atlanta Rhythm Section and others, assumed the producer's reins, and Survivor co-founder Jim Peterik became a frequent songwriting collaborator with the band from 1979 on, which helped account for this change in sound and subsequent success.\n\"Rockin' into the Night\", the title track from the group's third album (released in October 1979), which Peterik and his bandmates had originally written for Survivor, found its way to 38 Special's manager, Mark Spector, and was given to the band. Sung by 38's guitarist Don Barnes (who would sing lead vocals on all of the band's hits through 1987), the tune became their first song to receive national airplay, peaking at No. 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1980.\nThis paved the way for their platinum-selling fourth record, Wild-Eyed Southern Boys (January 1981), and its bigger hit \"Hold On Loosely\" (which reached No. 27 in 1981).\nTheir next release, Special Forces (May 1982), contained the Top 10 hit \"Caught Up in You\" (just like \"Hold On Loosely\", composed by Barnes, Carlisi, and Peterik), which hit No. 1 on the Billboard Rock Tracks chart, as did the single \"If I'd Been the One\" (October 1983) from their November 1983 release Tour de Force. \"You Keep Runnin' Away\" (August 1982) and \"Back Where You Belong\" (February 1984) continued the sequence of hit radio favorites.\nIn the fall of 1984, they had another hit with \"Teacher, Teacher\", from the soundtrack of the 1984 film Teachers, written by Jim Vallance and Bryan Adams. The song climbed to No. 4 on the Billboard Top Tracks Chart, spending ten weeks on the chart.\nIn 1984 38 Special toured with the up-and-coming Huey Lewis and the News, who were just breaking huge with their Sports album, and in 1986 they shared the bill with the soon-to-be-platinum-selling hard rock band Bon Jovi.\nBy 1987, Don Barnes had decided to leave the band to go out on his own. He recorded an album called Ride the Storm, which, though slated for release in 1989, was shelved after A&M Records was sold, and was not released until 2017 – some 28 years later.\nIn the meantime, the group moved on, bringing in guitarist Danny Chauncey, after drummer Steve Brookins also decided to leave, and singer/keyboardist Max Carl, from West Coast rhythm and blues group Jack Mack & the Heart Attack.\nThe next release, Rock & Roll Strategy (June 1988), saw the group playing down their heavy guitar sound and putting forth a more 1980s pop keyboard-oriented approach, led by Carl's more R&B-style voice. \"Second Chance\" (taken from Rock & Roll Strategy) was a No. 1 hit on Billboard's adult contemporary chart in early 1989.\nCarl was also lead singer on \"The Sound of Your Voice\" (Billboard Hot 100 No. 33 in 1991) from Bone Against Steel (July 1991), which saw the group moving from A&M to the American iteration of the British label Charisma Records. That same year, Bobby Capps came aboard as keyboardist/co-singer, and drummer Scott Meeder replaced Jack Grondin after Grondin decided to leave the music business. The band found themselves without a home after Charisma folded in 1992.\nAfter touring with the band through the spring of 1992, Max Carl decided to depart, making way for the return of Don Barnes. Since that time, the band has mostly concentrated on touring, with an occasional release of new material. Scott Hoffman took over the drum chair from Meeder later in 1992. Donny Baldwin (ex-Jefferson Starship) filled in for Hoffman on some 1996 tour dates after Hoffman was down with a broken arm, but Gary \"Madman\" Moffatt (formerly of Cactus) has been the band's drummer since 1997.\nIn early 1997, 38's long time guitarist/co-founder Jeff Carlisi, tired of the endless touring, decided to leave to form the Bonnie Blue Band, which led to the supergroup Big People, which also featured Benjamin Orr (from the Cars), Liberty DeVitto (from Billy Joel's band), Derek St. Holmes (ex-Ted Nugent) and Pat Travers. Unfortunately Big People failed to launch after the death of Benjamin Orr in 2000.\nThrough the small Razor & Tie label, 38 Special released \"Fade to Blue\" from the album Resolution (The last album to feature Carlisi, released in June 1997). The single hit No. 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart in 1997.\nSince 1997's Resolution, two more releases have followed on the CMC International and Sanctuary Records labels, respectively A Wild-Eyed Christmas Night (September 2001) and Drivetrain (July 2004).\n\n\n=== 2000s–present ===\nIn 2007 .38 Special was the opening act on Lynyrd Skynyrd and Hank Williams Jr.'s Rowdy Frynds Tour. Also, on September 27, 2008, they filmed a CMT Crossroads special with country singer Trace Adkins, performing both artists' hits from over the years.\nIn 2009 .38 Special opened for REO Speedwagon and Styx as part of the \"Can't Stop Rockin' Tour\".\nVan Zant missed a handful of shows in 2011, and in 2012 a notice was posted on 38 Special's website saying Donnie Van Zant would not tour with the band due to health issues related to inner-ear nerve damage, although he would continue to write and record with the band. In 2013, after nearly a year of missing performances, Van Zant officially left 38 Special after 39 years and retired from music.\nIn 2012 original bassist Ken Lyons died at age 59.\nIn 2014 longtime bassist Larry Junstrom was replaced by Barry Dunaway (a veteran of many classic rock groups, including Pat Travers Band, Yngwie Malmsteen and Survivor). Dunaway had previously filled in for Junstrom for a handful of shows in 2011, and a few shows in 2013 as well. Junstrom was then forced to retire due to a hand injury that required surgery.\nSince 2019, the band's lineup has consisted of Don Barnes, keyboardist/vocalist Bobby Capps, drummer Gary Moffatt, Dunaway, and guitarist Jerry Riggs. This leaves Don Barnes as the only original member, although Barnes was absent from the band from 1987 until 1992.\nLarry Junstrom died on October 6, 2019, at age 70.\nIn 2022 bassist Paul Drennan filled in for Barry Dunaway.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Lineups ===\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n38 Special (1977)\nSpecial Delivery (1978)\nRockin' into the Night (1979)\nWild-Eyed Southern Boys (1981)\nSpecial Forces (1982)\nTour de Force (1983)\nStrength in Numbers (1986)\nRock & Roll Strategy (1988)\nBone Against Steel (1991)\nResolution (1997)\nA Wild-Eyed Christmas Night (2001)\nDrivetrain (2004)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n38 Special at AllMusic \n38 Special live photo gallery"

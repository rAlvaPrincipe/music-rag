    "text": "Only the Poets are an English band from Reading, formed in 2017 and currently consisting of members Tommy Longhurst, Andrew \"Andy/Roo\" Burge, Clem Cherry, and Marcus Yates.\n\n\n== Members ==\nLead vocalist and guitarist Tommy Longhurst, from Woodley, was a solo artist prior to Only the Poets, and became inspired by bands he saw at Reading and Leeds Festivals to start a band of his own. Andrew \"Andy/Roo\" Burge was a bassist for another band whom Longhurst linked up with upon its dissolution.\nLonghurst and Burge worked with multiple guitarists and drummers until finding Marcus Yates and Jarred Philips of the band Pixel Fix through their mutual manager Sam Jackson. Philips later left, and his role was taken over by Clem Cherry, another former Pixel Fix member.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOnly the Poets released their debut single titled \"Ceasefire\" on 20 February 2017, followed by further singles such as \"Emotional\", \"Dead Young\", and \"Stolen Bikes\". They had their first live gigs as a band in 2018. They also supported Coasts. In 2021, Only the Poets released their debut EP Speak Out, through which they promoted mental health awareness.\nOnly the Poets supported singer-songwriter Louis Tomlinson on the UK and Europe leg of his self-titled world tour in 2022, a position they had secured in 2020, before embarking on their own headline tour that summer and autumn. They made a point of making tickets affordable for lower income individuals. They also released their second EP Our Time.\nOnly the Poets continued their Feels Like Home headline tour the next year, opening for Lewis Capaldi and Bastille, and performing at festivals such as Lollapalooza Paris and Reading Festival. Also in 2023, Only the Poets signed with Virgin EMI Records. Their first single with EMI was \"Even Hell\", which Longhurst described as \"our love letter to music\". Only the Poets promoted the next single \"Jump!\" with a surprise gig.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nIn 2020, Longhurst stated Only the Poets were sonically inspired by 90s Britpop bands like Blur, Oasis, and The Cure. Their music has drawn comparisons to Villagers, The Script, The 1975, Bruce Springsteen, and Sam Fender.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Demo albums ===\nDemos.

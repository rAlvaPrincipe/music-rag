    "text": "Fotomaker  was a power pop group from Long Island, New York who released three albums between 1978 and 1979. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 1977 by bassist Gene Cornish and drummer Dino Danelli, former members of The Rascals (although Cornish was guitarist for the group). Soon, guitarist/vocalist Wally Bryson, (formerly of the Raspberries) was added, alongside guitarist/vocalist Lex Marchesi and keyboardist/vocalist Frankie Vinci. Fotomaker debuted at the newly remodeled Cleveland Agora in early 1978.\nFotomaker's debut release, titled Fotomaker, was released on February 28, 1978 on Atlantic Records. The LP was produced and engineered by Eddie Kramer, Ron Albert, and Howard Albert. The lead single release, \"Where Have You Been All My Life\", reached #81 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was included on the Rhino Record's compilation LP Poptopia! Power Pop Classics Of The '70s, alongside singles by other prominent power pop artists including Badfinger, Raspberries, Cheap Trick, and The Knack.\nThe second album, Vis-a-Vis, was released in October, 1978. It was recorded at The Record Plant studios (used by the Raspberries) that summer at Wally Bryson's suggestion. Vis-a-Vis opened with Vinci's song \"Miles Away\", which was released as a single and peaked at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nWally Bryson had already left the band before the band's third album, Transfer Station, released in 1979. Fotomaker did not tour in support of Transfer Station. The album failed to reach the charts, and the group disbanded shortly afterwards.\n\n\n== Post-Fotomaker careers ==\nIn 1997, Gene Cornish and Dino Danelli, along with former Rascals bandmates Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nWally Bryson returned home to Cleveland early 1979, joining Dann Klawon's band \"Peter Panic\". Bryson has also collaborated with his son Jesse, in The Bryson Group. \nFrankie Vinci has done plenty of TV work, including jingles and music for the Super Bowl, and has written songs for others such as country artist Tim McGraw. He also wrote songs for the 1983 summer camp slasher film Sleepaway Camp.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\nSingles\n\n\n== References =="

They released a number of singles between 1985 and 1987, scoring two minor hits on the UK Singles Chart with the songs \"This Is the Shirt\" and \"Heaven\". They featured on BBC Radio 1 In Concert in 1985, backed by their live band Brad Lang (bass), Ian Penman (keyboards) and Steve Creese (drums). Their record producers included Nigel Gray, Neil O'Connor and Chris Porter. They were signed to Polydor Records, but despite much promotion, their singles failed expectations and were dropped before releasing an album.\nIn the 1990s, Noel Ram became a dance producer, performing and remixing a number of singles.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n7\" singles\n\nFeb 1985: \"Rescue Me\"\nApr 1985: \"This Is the Shirt\" - UK No. 87\nSep 1986: \"Mouth of an Angel\"\nJan 1987: \"Heaven\" - UK No. 63\nApr 1987: \"This Is the Shirt\" (re-issue) - UK No. 98\n12\" singles\n\nFeb 1985: \"Rescue Me\"\nApr 1985: \"This Is the Shirt\"\nSep 1986: \"Mouth of an Angel\"\nJan 1987: \"Heaven\"\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Kennedys are an American folk-rock band, consisting of husband and wife Pete and Maura Kennedy. They are recognized for their harmonies and instrumental prowess, blending elements of country music, bluegrass, Western swing and janglepop.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPete and Maura Kennedy met in Austin, Texas in 1992, when Pete was playing in Nanci Griffith's band. For their first date, they each drove 500 miles to meet at Buddy Holly's grave in Lubbock, Texas.\nIn June of 1993, Maura Kennedy (née Boudreau) joined Griffith's band as a harmony singer, and Maura and Pete began their career as a duo when they opened for Griffith during her UK and Ireland tour.\nPete is from the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.; Maura grew up in Syracuse, New York. They lived for many years in the East Village in New York City, and in 2006 they joined other folk musicians living in Northampton, Massachusetts. They then returned to the East Village in 2008. {They currently reside in Tarrytown, NY.\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and after losing concert engagements in 2020, the Kennedys started a weekly, all-request livestreaming show, beginning on Sunday, March 15, 2020, and running every Sunday. After the first several shows, they began including specialty shows, paying tribute to some of their favorite musical influences such as Bob Dylan, Buddy Holly, The Everly Brothers, John Lennon, Nanci Griffith, Patsy Cline, The Byrds, and a four-part Beatles mini-series. In addition, they have presented hours dedicated to specific genres, including the Summer of Love, a Beach Party, California Country Rock, British Invasion, and a Motown special. \n\n\n=== Recordings ===\nTheir first album, River of Fallen Stars, was released under the name \"Pete and Maura Kennedy\"; they released all subsequent albums as \"The Kennedys\".\nTheir 1998 album Angel Fire featured many songs with literary references, such as \"A Letter To Emily\" and \"Just Like Henry David\".\n\n\n=== Performing and touring ===\nWhen performing live, Pete plays the acoustic and electric guitar, electric sitar, bass, mandolin, and ukulele, while Maura plays acoustic and electric guitars and ukulele.\nThey have performed in clubs and theatres throughout the United States, on a cruise, and at Bill Clinton's first and second inaugurations.\nThe Kennedys were awarded the Kate Wolf Memorial Award by the World Folk Music Association in 2001.\n\n\n=== Other projects ===\nIn late 2006, Pete and Maura joined with Chris and Meredith Thompson to form The Strangelings, a folk-rock band prominently featuring Pete's electric sitar. Their first performance was on January 12, 2007. The music includes songs by both the Kennedys and the Thompsons in addition to traditional songs and covers. The full lineup of The Strangelings includes Pete, Maura, Chris Thompson, Eric Lee on fiddle, Cheryl Prashker on percussion, and Ken Anderson and Rebecca Hall, also known as Hungrytown.\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nSome of the Kennedys's influences include Nanci Griffith, Richard Thompson, Bob Dylan, Dave Carter, and Buddy Holly.

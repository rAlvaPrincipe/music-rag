    "text": "Defunkt is an American musical group founded by the trombonist and singer Joseph Bowie in 1978 in New York City. Their music touches on elements of punk rock, funk, and jazz.\n\n\n== Career ==\nJoseph Bowie is the brother of big band musician Byron Bowie and Art Ensemble of Chicago co-founder Lester Bowie. Joseph, who had previously worked as a sideman for various 1970s jazz musicians, founded Defunkt in 1978 with members of a band that had backed James Chance. The new group's original focus was on danceable jazz music. Joseph Bowie remains the only consistent member of the group over its history; he has been noted for displaying the influence of far-ranging musicians like Ornette Coleman, James Brown, and Joe Strummer.\nThe first incarnation of the group was active in New York City's \"No Wave\" radical underground music scene, which also included fusion-oriented groups like Material and Sonic Youth. Joseph's saxophonist brother Bryon, bassist Melvin Gibbs and future Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid were early contributors. The group's debut self-titled album was released in 1980 and combined the band's original jazz focus with soul, funk, rock, and blues. That album was particularly popular in Eastern Europe and Japan. Their second album Thermonuclear Sweat followed in 1982.\nBowie disbanded the group in 1983 due to a lack of mainstream success, and retired to the island of St. Croix for a few years. He returned to New York in 1986 and assembled a new Defunkt lineup, with the addition of multiple singers and a large horn section to pursue a new focus on combining 1930s big band and swing music with 1970s funk. This incarnation of the group, with many lineup changes under Bowie's leadership, has released several additional studio albums, starting with In America in 1988. Their latest album, Mastervolt, was released in 2015.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nAllMusic described the Defunkt's music as \"some of the most adventurous sounds of the last quarter of the 20th century.\" Trouser Press has praised the group's later works for \"a dynamic rock-funk-jazz concoction of popping bass, neck-melting guitar [...] and Bowie's inventive trombone figures and up-close-and-personable vocals.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDefunkt (1980)\nThe Razor's Edge (12\"-Maxi-Single, 1981)\nThermonuclear Sweat (1982)\nIn America (1988)\nAvoid the Funk: a Defunkt Anthology (Compilation, 1988)\nHeroes (1990)\nLive at the Knitting Factory (Live, 1991)\nCrisis (1992)\nCum Funky (1993)\nLive and Reunified (Live, 1993)\nA Blues Tribute to Muddy Waters and Jimi Hendrix (1994)\nOne World (1995)\nDefunkt live in Stuttgart (Live, 1996)\nThe Legend of Defunkt, Volume 1 (Compilation, 2001)\nDefunkt – The Legend Continues (2001)\nDefunkt Live in Europe (Live-Doppelalbum, 2002)\nJourney (2004)\nDefunkt + Thermonuclear Sweat (2005)\nMastervolt (2015)\nLive at Channel Zero (2016)\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\n\nJoseph Bowie – trombone, vocals\nKim Clarke – bass\nBill Bickford – guitar\nJohn Mulkerin – trumpet\nKenny Martin – drums\n\n\n=== Former ===\nRonny Drayton – guitar\nKelvyn Bell – guitar\nAyodele Maakheru (Martin Aubert) – guitar\nVernon Reid – guitar\nRichard Martin – guitar\nRocco Zifarelli - guitar\nMelvin Gibbs – bass\nRon Mac Jenkins – bass\nReggie Washington – bass\nTed Daniels – trumpet\nByron Bowie – saxophone\nLuther Thomas – saxophone\nCharles Green – saxophone\nAlex Harding – baritone saxophone\nRonnie Burrage – drums\nRishard Lampese – guitar\nSkoota Warner – drums\nTobias Ralph – drums\nKahil El'Zabar – percussion\nKelli Sae – vocals\nMartin Fischer – keyboards\nMarcus Persiani – keyboards\nKevin Bents – keyboards\nBahnamous Bowie – keyboards\nAdam Klipple – keyboards\nCliff Branch – keyboards\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSquat Theatre\nDefunkt at AllMusic"

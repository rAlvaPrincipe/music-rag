    "text": "Jeniferever is a band from Uppsala, Sweden formed in 1996. Their music could be described as ambient indie rock or post-rock; it is slow-paced, melodic, and frequently building to an orchestral-like climax. Their sound has been compared to bands such as The Appleseed Cast and Sigur Rós. Their name is derived from a 1989 Smashing Pumpkins song of the same name.\nThey released a four track EP Iris on the Big Scary Monsters Recording Company label. Their debut full-length record Choose a Bright Morning was released on Drowned in Sound Recordings and was later re-released through Monotreme Records. Their second album Spring Tides was released on Monotreme Records in 2009. The band released its third album Silesia on 11 April 2011. A track from Silesia, \"Waifs & Strays\", was released for free download in January 2011. The band have not officially announced that they have disbanded, but have been on a long-term hiatus since 2012. \n\n\n== Members ==\nKristofer Jönson – lead vocals, guitar, keyboards\nMartin Sandström – guitar, backing vocals\nOlle Bilius – bass, guitar, keyboards, backing vocals\nFredrik Aspelin – drums, backing vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nChoose a Bright Morning (2006)\nSpring Tides (2009)\nSilesia (2011)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nChronicles of Omega (2001) \nJeniferever (2002)\nJeniferever / The Next Autumn Soundtrack (split EP with The Next Autumn Soundtrack) (2003)\nIris (2004)\nNangijala (2008)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"From Across the Sea\" (2006)\n\"The Sound of Beating Wings\" (2006)\n\"Alvik\" (2006)\n\"To the Beat of Our Own Blood\" (2011)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nJeniferever discography at Discogs"

    "text": "Huldreslåt is a Scandinavian folk band that was born not in Scandinavia but in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2006. The musicians devote themselves to the study of the vast musical legacy of Northern Europe. Their work consists in taking melodies that hail from Scandinavia to perform them at their discretion, based on the musical formation of each member of the project. \nFurthermore, it is notable to mention that they do not leave the musical heritage of the Slav and Baltic countries aside, but include several tunes from these so rich in culture and history regions.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nMartín Fuchinecco - Fiddle, Kantele, Accordion, Säckpipa, Nyckelharpa.\nSergio Ribnikov Gunnarsson - Vocals, Irish Bouzouki, Härjedalspipa, Vevlira.\nJohanna Ribnikov Gunnarsson - Vocals, Mungiga, Kulning.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Huldreslåt Website\nHuldreslåt YouTube\nHuldreslåt Fotolog\nHuldreslåt Facebook\nHuldreslåt Twitter\nHuldreslåt Friendfeed\nHuldreslåt Lastfm\nHuldreslåt Feedburner\nHuldreslåt Google Profile\nHuldreslåt Google Reader"

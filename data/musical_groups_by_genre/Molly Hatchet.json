    "text": "Molly Hatchet is an American rock band formed by guitarist Dave Hlubek in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1971. They experienced popularity and commercial success during the late 1970s and early to mid-1980s amongst southern rock and hard rock communities and listeners. The band released six studio albums on Epic Records between 1978 and 1984, including the platinum-selling hit records Molly Hatchet (1978), Flirtin' with Disaster (1979), and Beatin' the Odds (1980). They also had charting singles on the US Billboard charts, including \"Flirtin' with Disaster\", \"The Rambler\", \"Bloody Reunion\" and \"Satisfied Man\". Molly Hatchet has released many more studio albums since their split with Epic Records in 1985, although none have been as successful as their early albums, nor have charted in the United States.\nAs of August 2, 2020, all of the band's original members are deceased. The Molly Hatchet trademark is owned by Bobby Ingram, their guitarist since 1987 (when he replaced founding member Dave Hlubek, who rejoined the band eighteen years later and stayed with them until his death in 2017). The other veteran in the lineup is keyboardist John Galvin, who has been a member since 1984 (with the exception of a break in the mid-1990s). Also included in the current lineup are veteran musicians of the Southern scene, drummer Shawn Beamer, bassist Tim Lindsey and vocalist Parker Lee.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Classic era and commercial success (1971–1980) ===\nMolly Hatchet was founded by guitarist Dave Hlubek in 1971. The band originated and was based in Jacksonville, Florida, and shared influences and inspiration with what is perhaps the most well-known act in the Southern rock genre, Lynyrd Skynyrd.\nDuring the late 1960s, Hlubek (vocals, guitar), Skip Lake (drums), Tim Lindsey (bass) and Chris Caruso (keyboards) were in the Psychedelic music outfit Mind Garden. Lindsey left (only to return many years later and is the current bassist for Hatchet) and Hlubek and Lake formed Molly Hatchet in 1971, along with lead singer/frontman Bobby Maddox and guitarist Steve Holland, who had replaced Caruso. Guitarist Donald Hall was also briefly a member in these early days, after Holland left temporarily in 1973.\nIn an interview Dave Hlubek told the story of the band's name:\n\n\"A friend of ours went to University of Florida in Gainesville. Bobby Maddox was his name. This was long before Danny Joe. Bobby Maddox was a real Mick Jagger type. We were looking for a name for the band. We were wanting to work. There were around twelve rock clubs in the Jacksonville area in the 70s. You could make a hell of a living. By the time you made your way through the twelfth, it was time to start all over again. We were changing the name of the band every two weeks. They would just get used to the name of the group and we would finish the twelfth club and start over as \"The Imbeciles\" or something. People would not know who we were. This was the same band that packed the place a few weeks before. Finally, we said, 'We need to come up with a name for the group.' We took a John Deere Tractor hat and everybody came up with three names apiece and put them in the hat. We did it like the lottery. We said that whatever name was pulled out of the hat, by God, was going to be the name of the band and that's it. Well, the eighteenth name, the only one left, was Molly Hatchet! We said, ‘What the hell is that'? Everyone was asking, ‘Who's the girl in the band'? The people of Jacksonville took it upon themselves to start making bumper stickers. We just kept the name. Molly was an axe murderess. Her name was Abigail something. The history books called her Hatchet Molly. She was some passion killer.\n\nBassist Banner Thomas joined in 1973, invited by his friend Donald Hall. During this period, the band even toyed with changing the group's name to Bandit but soon went back to the Molly Hatchet moniker. Maddox was gone by this time and shortly afterwards, Hall was replaced by Duane Roland and Fred Bianco, a friend Thomas had met working in a music store, joined as drummer. Roland only lasted a month before he left and Kenny Niblick was the new guitarist until he and Bianco quit in mid-1975 as Steve Holland returned and Bruce Crump became the drummer. Roland (who had subbed for Hlubek for some shows) returned to take his position as third guitarist in the band later on the following year. And after Maddox left, Hlubek was the band's vocalist prior to former Rum Creek singer Danny Joe Brown's entrance in the spring of 1976.\nThe first lineup of Molly Hatchet to record was in place by 1976. Guitarists Dave Hlubek and Steve Holland, bassist Banner Thomas and drummer Bruce Crump were joined in the spring of 1976 by Brown and  Duane Roland, who returned later during that same year to complete the group, leading to the so called \"Three Guitar Army\". In a 2008 interview in Modern Drummer magazine, Crump talked about the band's early days, signing with manager Pat Armstrong and Ronnie Van Zant's interest in producing Molly Hatchet:\n\n\"We started playing the Florida bar circuit until some of the guys from 38 Special recommended a guy they knew from Macon, Georgia who had managed a few bands. Pat Armstrong and his brother Jack ran a management/booking agency in Macon, so we went up and played for them. I guess they liked what they heard, because they encouraged us to start writing our own material. We did just that, and the next thing you know, we’re in the studio recording some demos. By now we’re into 1977, and Ronnie Van Zant from Skynyrd got wind of what we were doing and took us under his wing—even letting us cut some songs at the Skynyrd studio. As best as I can remember, Ronnie was given the green light to produce some bands and we were going to be one of them. Then the worst possible thing happened. We were coming back to Atlanta after playing a gig near Lynchburg, Tennessee.  When we pulled into the hotel parking lot, Pat Armstrong, who had become our manager and had gone with us, went inside the hotel to check us in. All of a sudden, he walked onto the bus, white as a sheet, and said that the Skynyrd plane had crashed.\"\n\nThe producer on their first record, Tom Werman, known for working with straight rock music acts such as Cheap Trick and Ted Nugent, combined boogie, blues and hard rock. The band released their first album, Molly Hatchet, in September 1978, supported by \"Dreams I'll Never See\" (a cover of the Allman Brothers Band 1969 track \"Dreams\"), which got AOR (album-oriented rock) airplay. The album was followed a year later by Flirtin' with Disaster, with its title song another AOR hit, as was its first track, \"Whiskey Man\", from the album. Molly Hatchet proceeded to tour behind both records and expanded their fan base, appearing at theaters, arenas and stadiums with the likes of AC/DC, Aerosmith, The Babys, The Charlie Daniels Band, Cheap Trick, Def Leppard, Journey, Judas Priest, Eddie Money, The Outlaws, REO Speedwagon, Rush, Santana, Scorpions, Bob Seger, Thin Lizzy, .38 Special, Pat Travers, UFO and The Who.\n\n\n=== First changes and breakup (1980–1990) ===\nLead singer Danny Joe Brown left the band in May 1980 due to diabetes and other reasons, only to return two years later. After Brown left Molly Hatchet, he formed the Danny Joe Brown Band.\nBrown was then replaced in Molly Hatchet by vocalist Jimmy Farrar, a native of LaGrange, Georgia. The earlier albums seemed to some commentators to exhibit a distinct southern cultural influence; that sound changed with the addition of Farrar. Danny Joe Brown's stage persona, gruff voice and cowboy horse-whistling was replaced by Jimmy Farrar's new vocal style, mixed with a new, harder-rocking sound. With the success of the next album, Beatin' the Odds released September 1980, the band ventured away from the Southern rock sound of their first albums. Nonetheless, Molly Hatchet toured successfully in support of Beatin' the Odds, opening for bands such as Blue Öyster Cult, AC/DC and The Outlaws, as well as headlining their own tour that was supported by the Michael Schenker Group and the Johnny Van Zant Band. By 1981, Molly Hatchet had evolved to a straight-ahead rock style and a slicker production, as exhibited on Take No Prisoners (November 1981). The band remained a successful act on the touring circuit.\nLongtime bass player Banner Thomas left in November 1981 and was replaced by Riff West. During the following year, drummer B. B. Borden (also known as B. B. Queen as a member of the funk rock band Mother's Finest) replaced Crump, who had moved to Los Angeles. Farrar then left the group to make way for Brown's return. Brown rejoined the band in May 1982.\nIn March 1983 the line-up of Brown, Hlubek, Holland, Roland, West and Borden released the band's fifth album No Guts...No Glory. While touring for the album during the spring and summer of 1983, Hatchet was touring with fellow Jacksonville natives Blackfoot. Just before a gig at Memorial Hall in Kansas City, Kansas on June 11, 1983, though, Brown, Holland and Roland decided to leave and return home, leaving only Hlubek, West and Borden to play the show. After a quick rehearsal backstage, Blackfoot's Rickey Medlocke took Brown's place as front man and their other guitarist, Charlie Hargrett, played behind Hlubek's lead. Danny and the other members of Molly Hatchet rejoined the tour the next day, but Holland decided to leave the band once again in 1984 and was replaced by former Danny Joe Brown Band keyboardist John Galvin, who already guested in No Guts..No Glory the year before. \nIn November 1984 the album The Deed Is Done was released, produced by Terry Manning, which was more of a straightforward Pop rock offering, with Bruce Crump returning on drums.\nNovember 1985 featured the unveiling of the band's double live album Double Trouble Live, after which the band was dropped by Epic. After mulling over possibly changing their sound to even more of a Pop rock style, they ended up retaining Brown and their Southern rock style.\nGuitarist/founder Hlubek, who later admitted to suffering from drug troubles, left Molly Hatchet in January 1987. He was replaced by Bobby Ingram, who had contributed backup vocals to Double Trouble, had played as a guitarist in the Danny Joe Brown Band together with John Galvin and had also played in the Seventies with Brown in Rum Creek.\nIn the summer of 1988, Scott Zsymoski filled in on drums for Bruce Crump, who was home with his wife as she was giving birth to their baby. \nMolly Hatchet's first studio album in five years, and only release on Capitol Records, Lightning Strikes Twice was published in 1989, and it was their first one not to appear on the charts. One of its singles, \"There Goes the Neighborhood\", did, however, enter the top 30 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The band went on a year-long tour to support the album, playing smaller venues such as clubs and theaters, as opposed to the stadiums and arenas that had expanded their popularity.\nOn July 8, 1990 Molly Hatchet, which had been dropped by Capitol after the commercial failure of Lighting Strikes Twice, announced at a show in Toledo, Ohio, that the concert would be their final one; after that night, the band would be disbanding.  A greatest hits collection released by Epic, Greatest Hits, featuring two newly recorded songs, was released in the fall of 1990, with sales reaching gold status. At the time Duane Roland left as last in 1990, he was the owner of the Molly Hatchet name. The agreement in the band had always been that the last man standing got the brand.\n\n\n=== Refoundation and rotating members (1990–2005) ===\n\nIn late 1990, after some failed attempts to involve former members, a revised version of the band led by Brown and Ingram - both temporarily licensed from guitarist Duane Roland and Armstrong Management to the use of name Molly Hatchet - featured new players Rik Blanz (guitar), Rob Scavetto (keyboards), Eddie Rio (bass) and David Feagle (drums). But the lineup in the 1990s was more like a revolving door. Rio was replaced in 1991 by Rob Sweat and then Kevin Rian. Feagle was succeeded the same year by drummer Kenny Holton. Blanz left in mid-1991 and Phil McCormack stood in for Brown briefly in early 1992. By 1993, the lineup was: Brown, Ingram, Erik Lundgren (guitar), Mac Crawford (drums) and a returning Banner Thomas (bass), with Mike Kach (keyboards), who was replaced in 1994 by Andy Orth. Bryan Bassett (ex-Wild Cherry) took over as second guitarist in 1994 and Buzzy Meekins (formerly of the Outlaws and Danny Joe Brown Band) was bassist after Banner left again in 1995. During the first half of the 1990s, Molly Hatchet played selected shows and tours, but did not record again until 1995, when they began working on a new studio album with German producer Kalle Trapp.\nIn April 1995 after continuing health problems, Brown had to once again leave the band and Jimmy Farrar was brought back for a few weeks to front the group and help \"legitimize\" the current version. The crowd reaction to Farrar being back was not overly positive, though, so Ingram and Brown together made the decision to bring back Brown's 1992 stand-in, Phil McCormack, as the permanent singer. During the rest of the decade, the line-up did not feature any of the members who had performed in Molly Hatchet prior to 1983. Farrar later rejoined other original members of Molly Hatchet in Southern Rock Allstars and Gator Country. McCormack fronted Molly Hatchet for their next album Devil's Canyon (June 1996). At this point, the band consisted of vocalist Phil McCormack, guitarists Bobby Ingram and Bryan Bassett, returning keyboardist John Galvin, bassist Andy McKinney, and drummer Mac Crawford. This line-up recorded also one second album Silent Reign of Heroes (June 1998). In that same period, keyboardist Tim Donovan began filling in for Galvin on the road and Sean Shannon became the group's new drummer in 1998 after Crawford left. In 1999 the band traveled coast to coast with Charlie Daniels and the Volunteer Jam.\nFormer Hatchet singer Danny Joe Brown, despite a long battle with diabetes and the effects of a stroke, was able to take the stage one last time at the Jammin' for DJB benefit concert organized by former Hatchet bassist Riff West on July 18, 1999, at Orlando, Florida's Club LaVela. With the help of his friends and former members Bruce Crump, Banner Thomas, Steve Holland and Dave Hlubek, he ended the show with \"Flirtin' with Disaster\".\nIn June 2000 Bobby Ingram became the sole owner of the trade and service mark \"Molly Hatchet\", acquired from management and from original guitarist Duane Roland. Also in 2000, Kingdom of XII was recorded by the pretty stable line-up and released in Europe and the band then toured Europe to promote the album. It was released in the United States in June 2001. But new changes were ahead: after the recording of Kingdom, guitarist Russ Maxwell came aboard after Bassett left the group to rejoin Foghat.\nShawn Beamer (from Southern Rock Rebellion) replaced Sean Shannon in the fall of 2001. Bassist Jerry Scott (formerly with Brian Howe's band) joined in early 2002 after McKinney departed. That same year, Ingram took a short break from touring after suffering a heart attack and the band continued with only Maxwell on guitar. Also John Galvin, though he continued to appear on the band's albums, was again not touring with the band in the 2000s (except for a short European tour in December 2001). Tim Donovan (1997–2002), Scott Woods (2002), Jeff Ravenscraft (2003–2004), Gary Corbett (2004), and Richie Del Favero (2004–2005) played live keyboards until 2005, after which the group dispensed with having a touring keyboardist for a while. Bassist Jerry Scott was replaced by J.J. Strickland in May 2003 and then by Tim Lindsey, former of Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Rossington Band, Artimus Pyle Band and Mind Garden (with longtime friend Dave Hlubek), coming full circle back to his roots to take over in June 2003. Locked and Loaded (a live recording from 2000) was released in 2003, 25th Anniversary: Best of Re-Recorded followed in 2004, and Live In Hamburg (with second guitarist Jake Rutter) in 2005.\n\n\n=== Continued activity and deaths of former members (2005–2023) ===\n\nFrom that point Molly Hatchet kept on producing music around the core duo Ingram/Galvin plus rhythm section Lindsey/Beamer, with McCormack as frontman. But 2005 marked also the return of founding member Dave Hlubek after 18 years. Initially another guitarist, Jimbo Manion, played live alongside Ingram until Hlubek had satisfied his other commitments and was able to return full time later that year.\nDanny Joe Brown died on March 10, 2005, at his home in Davie, Florida. He was 53. The cause was kidney failure.\nOn June 19, 2006, guitarist Duane Roland died at his home in St. Augustine, Florida, at the age of 53. His death was listed as being of \"natural causes\" according to a June 25, 2006, obituary in The Boston Globe.\nWith Hlubek back in the line-up, Molly Hatchet released studio albums Warriors Of The Rainbow Bridge (2005) and Justice (recorded in Germany in 2010 on SPV Records), plus one live and two cover albums. The band's Southern Rock Masters (April 2008) was an album of classic rock covers and was released again in a slightly realtered form as Regrinding the Axes (June 2012). Molly Hatchet toured extensively once again.\nIn 2008 keyboardist John Galvin returned to the live stage after Hlubek's recurring health issues prevented him from appearing at all of the band's gigs.\nIn 2011 drummer Shawn Beamer had a heart attack and a temporary drummer, Scott Craig, was brought in. In 2013 Beamer returned to the band.\nIn 2014 former bassist \"Riff\" West died for the complications of a car accident, while in 2015 it was original drummer Bruce Crump who died.\nOn September 2, 2017, guitarist Dave Hlubek died of a heart attack. After Hlubek's passing, the group continued to perform with just one guitarist, as Ingram stated that he \"could not\" replace him. The typical guitar harmonies of the band are reproduced by Ingram and the keyboards of Galvin.\nIn the same year also original bassist Banner Thomas died.\nOn October 29, 2018, former singer of the Eighties  Jimmy Farrar died due to complications from congestive heart failure, kidney failure and liver failure.\nMolly Hatchet continued to tour extensively but had to replace frontman Phil McCormack due to persistent illness conditions. Singer Jimmy Elkins took his place for live gigs. McCormack died on April 25, 2019.\nJimmy Elkins was officially announced as the band's new vocalist in October 2019: he is featured on the Battleground live album. Tony Mikus (Big Engine) briefly stood in for Elkins in some live gigs of 2022.\nSteve Holland, the last original member of the group, died on August 2, 2020.\n\n\n=== Recent events (2023–present) ===\nDespite having no original members left, Molly Hatchet continues to perform and record. Their current lineup features half of the Lightning Strikes Twice era lineup (guitarist Bobby Ingram and keyboardist John Galvin) plus twenty and more years serving members, drummer Shawn Beamer and bassist Tim Lindsey.\nIn early 2023, new singer Parker Lee suddenly replaced Jimmy Elkins (who suffered a bad bike accident) fronting the band in US and European tours. Ingram reported to the press that a new Molly Hatchet album was in the works and intended for a 2024 release. The band debuted with Lee on vocals \"Firing Line\", their first song in thirteen years, on November 15, 2023.\n\n\n== Name and iconic cover art ==\nMolly Hatchet took its name from a prostitute who allegedly mutilated and decapitated her clients. One iconic aspect of Molly Hatchet's image is that many of the band's album covers feature art inspired by heroic fantasy, several of which were painted by artists such as Frank Frazetta, Boris Vallejo, and Paul R. Gregory.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nCurrent members\n\nBobby Ingram – lead, acoustic and slide guitars, backing vocals (1987–present)\nJohn Galvin – keyboards, synthesizers, piano, programming, backing vocals (1983–1990, 1995–present)\nShawn Beamer – drums, percussion (2001–present)\nTim Lindsey – bass, backing vocals (2003–present)\nParker Lee – lead vocals (2023–present)\n\n\n=== Deaths of former members ===\nOriginal vocalist Danny Joe Brown died in Davie, Florida, on March 10, 2005, at the age of 53.

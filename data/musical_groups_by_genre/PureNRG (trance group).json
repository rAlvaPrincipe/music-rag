    "text": "PureNRG are a live electronic music act, composed of members Solarstone and Giuseppe Ottaviani.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe name of the act was derived from Solarstone's 'Pure Trance' label, and Giuseppe's previous act 'Nu NRG'.\nThe duo began producing and performing together in 2015, and have since performed in clubs and at festivals regularly. When performing live, they use a custom designed set-up including many of the instruments and much of the equipment used to produce their music in the studio.\nIn 2016 they released the track 'Secret of the Sahara', which utilises a sample of a track by the same name, originally composed by Ennio Morricone. This was notable as Ennio has not allowed any of his music to be utilised in electronic music in over 20 years.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n Singles \n\n\n== References =="

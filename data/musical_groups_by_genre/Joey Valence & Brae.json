    "text": "Joey Valence & Brae are an American hip-hop duo from State College, Pennsylvania, consisting of rappers Joseph Bertolino (Joey Valence) and Braedan Lugue (Brae). They gained internet recognition thanks to their breakout song \"Punk Tactics\", the title track to their debut album.\n\n\n== History ==\nBertolino and Lugue met during their freshman year at Pennsylvania State University, where they became friends and started creating music together. Their first single \"Crank It Up\" was released in 2021.\nTheir seventh single \"Punk Tactics\" was released in 2022. The song was compared to the music of the Beastie Boys (Bertolino calling them their \"number #1 influence and inspiration\") and older alternative hip-hop songs, with frequent references to video games, and internet memes. The song went viral on social media. The music video for the song was entirely filmed on a Nintendo DSi.\nIn February 2022, the duo was featured as special guests on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and later appeared at the Aftershock Festival in October.\nThey opened alongside The Interrupters on Sum 41's final tour, Tour of the Setting Sum. \nTheir second album No Hands was released in 2024 to critical acclaim, and featured contributions from Z-Trip, Terror Reid and Danny Brown, with the album's singles \"The Baddest\" and \"Omnitrix\" gaining popularity on short-form social medias including Instagram Reels and TikTok.\nIn 2024, the duo was featured on Pendulum's song \"Napalm\". Later that year they would release the deluxe version of their album No Hands, including three new songs, a remix of The Baddest featuring Ayesha Erotica and a cover of the Charli XCX song \"365\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nPunk Tactics (2023)\nNo Hands (2024)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nThe Underground Sound (2022)\n\n\n=== Tours ===\nJVB Summer 2022 Tour (First tour)\nJVB Welcome To The Club Tour (2023)\nPunk Tactics Tour (2024)\nNo Hands Tour (2024)\n\n\n== References =="

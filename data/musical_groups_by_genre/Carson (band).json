    "text": "Carson was an Australian blues rock and boogie rock band, which formed in January 1970 in Melbourne as Carson County Band. They had a top 30 hit single on the Go-Set National Top 40 with \"Boogie\" in September 1972. The group released their debut studio album, Blown, in November on EMI and Harvest Records, which peaked at No. 14 on the Go-Set Top 20 Albums. Their performance at the second Sunbury Pop Festival in late January 1973 was issued as a live album, On the Air, in April but the group had already disbanded.\nMember, John Capek had left by mid 1970 and relocated to North America by 1973 where he worked as a composer (often with Marc Jordan), record producer and keyboardist both in Toronto, Canada and in Los Angeles, United States. After Carson disbanded, Broderick Smith formed the country rock band The Dingoes in 1973 and also had a successful solo career.\n\n\n== History ==\nCarson formed in Melbourne in January 1970 as Carson County Band and, influenced by United States group Canned Heat, performed blues rock and boogie rock. Founders of Carson County Band were Ian Ferguson on bass guitar and vocals, Greg \"Sleepy\" Lawrie on slide guitar and dobro (Creatures, Chocolate),  Tony Lunt on drums, Tony \"Drunkbelly\" Enery on Keyboard. Their debut single, \"On the Highway\", was issued in May on Rebel Records. In October they dropped the County Band from the name to avoid being confused as a country music group. Capek left mid 1970 to join King Harvest and eventually moved to North America. He worked as a composer (often with Marc Jordan), record producer and keyboardist both in Toronto, Canada and in Los Angeles.\nBroderick Smith (Adderley Smith Blues Band) replaced Ian Ferguson in mid 1971, providing vocals and harmonica. Ian Winter had joined on guitar at the beginning of 1971. The group released a second single, \"Travelling South\" in August on Havoc Records. Ian Ferguson, who later on joined Island and played at Sunbury in 1972, went on to form Tank late in 1972, had already left in July to be replaced successively by Barry Sullivan and then Garry Clarke. Mal Logan on keyboards joined later that year. Carson performed at the first Sunbury Pop Festival in late January 1972. On the Easter weekend, 31 March – 2 April, they played two sets at the Mulwala Pop Festival, supporting head-liners Canned Heat and Stephen Stills.\nSmith spent part of 1972 recording solo material. Meanwhile, Carson, with Smith returned, issued their next single \"Boogie\" in September, which reached No. 30 on the Go-Set National Top 40. This was followed in November by their debut album, Blown on Harvest Records produced by Rod Coe, which reached No. 14 on Go-Set Top 20 Albums.\nCarson performed at the second Sunbury Pop Festival, on the Australia Day long weekend in late January 1973. Ian Winter left soon after and by February, Carson had disbanded. A live recording of their Sunbury set, On the Air was released in April 1973. Smith was a founding member of country rockers, The Dingoes and later had a successful solo career.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nListed alphabetically:\n\nJohn Capek – piano, vocals, keyboards (1970)\nMal Capewell – saxophone (1972–1973)\nGary Clarke – bass guitar (1971–1973)\nIan Ferguson – bass guitar, vocals (1970–1971)\nGreg Lawrie – slide guitar, dobro (1970–1973)\nMal Logan – keyboards (1971–1973)\nTony Lunt – drums (1970–1973)\nBroderick Smith – vocals, harmonica (1971–1973)\nBarry Sullivan – bass guitar (1971)\nIan Winter – guitar (1971–1973)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Slim & Slam was a musical partnership in the late 1930s and early 1940s consisting of Bulee \"Slim\" Gaillard (vocals, guitar, vibes and piano) and Leroy Elliott \"Slam\" Stewart (bass and vocals). They produced novelty jazz numbers featuring Slim's distinctive vocal style with vocalese and scats, hipster argot and nonce words. Sam Allen played piano and Pompey \"Gus\" Dobson played drums on most of their early recordings.\nTheir biggest hit was \"Flat Foot Floogie (with a Floy Floy)\",.\nOther musicians who recorded with Slim & Slam included Charlie Parker, Ben Webster, Jimmy Rowles, Kenny Clarke, Al Killian, Chico Hamilton, Leo Watson and Garvin Bushel.\nThe song \"Tutti Frutti\" by Little Richard is loosely based on Slim & Slam's 1938 \"Tutti Frutti\" (Vocalion 4225).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArticle at ubuweb"

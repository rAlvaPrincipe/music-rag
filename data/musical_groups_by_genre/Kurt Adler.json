    "text": "Kurt Adler (March 1, 1907 – September 21, 1977) was an Austrian and American conductor, chorusmaster, author and pianist. He was best known as the chorus master and lead conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1943 to 1973.  He conducted orchestras in Europe, North America, Canada and Mexico.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKurt Adler was born in Jindřichův Hradec, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary (now the Czech Republic) to a bourgeois Jewish family. He was the only child of Siegfried Adler (born 1876), a textile factory owner, and Olga (Fürth) Adler (born 1882). Both parents were murdered by the Gestapo during World War II, after they were deported in 1942, from Vienna, Austria, to Izbica concentration camp, which served as a transfer camp, to the Bełżec extermination camp in Poland on May 15, 1942. His paternal grandparents, Jakob and Eveline Adler are buried in Neuhaus (now Jindřichův Hradec), Hebrew Cemetery. His maternal grandparents, Albert and Katherine Fürth are buried in Sušice, Czech Republic.\nDuring the 1930s many now-famous musicians, including Adler, emigrated to the United States to escape from Nazism. Adler left for the United States on October 9, 1938. He sailed from Rotterdam, Holland in 1938 on the \"SS Statendam\". He was naturalized on March 21, 1944.\n\n\n== Education ==\nKurt Adler began studying music at age six under cantor Jacob Fürnberg, in Jindřichův Hradec His first public appearance was at age fourteen.\nHis entire musical education was in Vienna, Austria.

In 1925, he graduated from the classical Akademisches Gymnasium, Vienna. In 1927, he earned a degree in musicology from the University of Vienna, corresponding to Master of Arts, Philosophical Faculty of the University of Vienna.\n\n\n== Life in the arts and humanities ==\nKurt Adler began his professional career in Germany on the musical staff of the Berlin State Opera. He later conducted at the New German Theatre in Prague and Städtische Oper in Berlin. He joined the Metropolitan Opera in 1943, under the management of Edward Johnson, then in conjunction with Rudolf Bing, from 1945 to 1973.\nMaestro Adler's press announcement upon his recruitment as chorusmaster of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City said, \"That since Giulio Setti's time, ten years ago, there never has been a single chorusmaster for the entire Italian, French, German, English repertoire and with my appointment, the gradual reorganization and training will again be centralized in one hand.\"\n\n\n== Languages ==\nEnglish, German, Czech, Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Latin, Greek, Romanian, Yiddish, Hebrew.\n\n\n== Engagements ==\n1927–1929 Assistant conductor, Berlin State Opera\n1929–1932 Conductor, Prague German Opera Theater\n1932–1933 Conductor, Berlin Municipal Opera House\n1933–1938 Conducting symphony concerts and opera all over Europe\n1933      Conductor of orchestral concerts, Vienna Grosser Musikvereinssaal\n1933      Founder of the Unio Opera Company, Vienna\n1933–1935 First Conductor, Academic Opera and Ballet Theater of the USSR, Kyiv\n1935–1937 Founder, Musical Director, and first conductor of the Symphonic Orchestra Stalingrad (Soviet Union)\n1938–1943 U.S.A.

Yet though they may be strong personalities or have complete mastery of their medium, still I would not call them real artists. A real artist must be humble. Vanity has been the core of many virtuoso careers but it also has been the end of genuine artistic growth. Psychologically, an accompanist and coach must try to search for and understand where the roots of his soloist's artistry lie. These roots are as varied as the individual artists. Faith – religious, metaphysical, or materialistic – is one of the strongest roots; faith in oneself is part of it. Some great artists – Richard Wagner, for instance – were extremely self-centered, compensating for this fault by preaching altruism in their works. This brings us to another root of artistry: compensation for shortcomings in one's makeup – atonement for real or imagined sins and errors. A third very important root is rebellion against family, upbringing, or an adverse fate. Among those who rebel are some of our greatest artists, who have become what they are by surmounting seemingly overwhelming odds. Complacency is not a good stimulus to artistry.\"\n\"In your world of rapidly changing values – welcome changes when they are the results of technical and scientific progress – spiritual, ethical, and artistic values tend likewise to change, but much more slowly, and not always for the better. What the future will bring, no one can say. I should like to venture the opinion that the vistas opening for us will render us more humble, more concerned with inner or spiritual values. Our technological advances should give us more time; we shall need culture and be able to afford it.\"\n\n\n== Publications ==\n1943 Adler, K.: Songs of many wars, from the sixteenth to the twentieth century.

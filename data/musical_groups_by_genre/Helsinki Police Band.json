The band is a pr-unit of the Helsinki Police Department, which is a local agency of the Police of Finland.\nThe band plays a very important part in the police department's public relations with citizens, with the band commonly representing the police department at many different national and international events. The orchestra is widely known for its versatile repertoire, including symphonic wind band music, as well as folk music, jazz, pop, and music for children.\nThe Helsinki Police Symphonic Band has enjoyed wide acclaim for decades. The band was first founded in 1947 to improve relations between the audience and the police. Since the beginning the band has performed in places where people gather: large events, hospitals, prisons, sports events, churches, parades, and music halls.\nThe orchestra plays regular concerts all around the country and performs at various occasions organized by the police. The band performs with Finland's best artists from various genres.

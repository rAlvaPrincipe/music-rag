Soon after, vocalists Saša Lukić and Milan Popović, guitarist Vojin Jovanović \"Voja\", bassist Siniša Nojković and drummer Relja Obrenović joined the band. Most of the band members were high school friends from the Eleventh Belgrade High School.\nThe band got the public's attention by numerous club performances in Belgrade and Zagreb.

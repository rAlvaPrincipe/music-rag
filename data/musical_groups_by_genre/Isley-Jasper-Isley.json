    "text": "Isley-Jasper-Isley was a splinter group of the Isley Brothers formed in 1984 by brother-in-law Chris Jasper (keyboards), Ernie Isley (lead guitar), and Marvin Isley (bass), due to creative differences that arose among the group.\n\n\n== History ==\nErnie Isley, Chris Jasper and Marvin Isley had performed on Isley Brothers recordings since 1969 and as members since the 3 + 3 album in 1973. They left the group in 1984, and released their first album Broadway's Closer to Sunset Blvd later that year.\nIsley-Jasper-Isley released two further albums on their CBS Associated Records label, including Caravan of Love. The title hit was a No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts. \"Caravan of Love\" was subsequently covered by English band the Housemartins, who made the song an international No. 1 pop hit in 1986. \"Caravan of Love\" was followed by three other top 20 R&B singles, \"Insatiable Woman\", \"8th Wonder of the World\", and \"Givin' You Back the Love\". The latter two tracks were featured on their final album Different Drummer.\nIn 1987, Isley-Jasper-Isley disbanded. Younger brothers Marvin and Ernie Isley returned to perform with older brother Ronald Isley. Jasper continued as a solo artist, multi-instrumentalist and producer, forming his own independent record label, Gold City Records. He has since released 14 solo albums, including four gospel albums. He released two albums on his CBS-Associated label, Gold City Records, including the No. 1 R&B hit \"Superbad\" in 1988. \nThe Isley-Jasper-Isley half of the group was inducted with the rest of the Isleys in 1992 to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in January 2014. Marvin Isley died from complications of diabetes in 2010.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n2003: The Best of Isley-Jasper-Isley: Caravan of Love\n2010: Broadway's Closer to Sunset Boulevard/Caravan of Love/Different Drummer (double CD)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n1984: \"Kiss & Tell\"\n1984: \"Look the Other Way\"\n1985: \"Caravan of Love\"\n1985: \"Insatiable Woman\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIsley-Jasper-Isley discography at Discogs \nOfficial website of Chris Jasper\nChris Jasper's YouTube channel\nGold City Records"

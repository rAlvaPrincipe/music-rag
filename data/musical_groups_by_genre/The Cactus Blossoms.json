    "text": "The Cactus Blossoms is an American alternative country and indie folk band based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The band is composed of brothers Jack Torrey (vocals, guitar, bass) and Page Burkum (vocals, guitar) with a touring act including Phillip Hicks (bass), Jake Hanson (guitar), and Jeremy Hanson (drums).\nThe band's musical styling of \"the sounds and approaches of early country and rock n' roll\" was inspired by traditional American folk music and \"hillbilly\" music and is \"reminiscent of 60s Nashville and Los Angeles as heard in artists like Roy Orbison, The Byrds,  Duane Eddy, and the Everly Brothers.\"\nThe band's third studio album, One Day, was released on Walkie Talkie Records on February 11, 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\nBrothers Jack Torrey and Page Burkum began playing music at ages 18 and 23, respectively, but didn't form the Cactus Blossoms duo until they were both in their 30s. The band began playing local shows in Minneapolis in 2010 and self produced and released a self-titled debut album in 2011. Their popularity secured them a residency at St. Paul's Turf Club where they self-produced their first live album titled Live at the Turf Club.\nAfter several tours supporting other artists, JD McPherson proposed working together, and produced their first studio album. In 2015 the band signed with Red House Records, which released their debut studio album, You're Dreaming, on January 22, 2016. The album reached #23 on the Americana Billboard chart and was met with favorable reviews with American Songwriter describing it as \"honest, unvarnished, completely engaging style that is clearly retro but in no way musty.\"\nIn 2017, the band appeared in the revival season of David Lynch's television series Twin Peaks, performing the song \"Mississippi\". The song is also featured on the soundtrack album, Twin Peaks: Music from the Limited Event Series.\nIn 2017 the band was invited by Dan Auerbach to his Nashville studio to write some songs together. Two of the songs, \"Got a Lotta Love\" and \"Blue as the Ocean\" appeared on their studio album Easy Way which released March 1, 2019. Departing Red House Records, the album was released on the band's own Walkie Talkie Records label.\nAfter taking a forced hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band began recording their third studio album in an at-home studio. On December 3, 2021 the band announced their third studio album One Day would release on February 11, 2022.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJack Torrey (guitar, bass, vocals)\nPage Burkum (guitar, vocals)\nPhillip Hicks (bass)\nJake Hanson (guitar)\nJeremy Hanson (drums)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nLive at the Turf Club (2013)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Happy Man\" (2020)\n\n\n== References =="

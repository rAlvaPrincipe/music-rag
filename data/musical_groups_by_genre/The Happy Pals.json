Bastien immigrated to Canada in 1962 after a brief stint in New Orleans. Bastien earned a reputation as a \"guru of New Orleans jazz in Toronto\". In 1968 Bastien founded the Kid Bastien's Camellia Jazz band, later to be renamed The Happy Pals. Bastien was now considered to be the foremost disciple of New Orleans trumpet legend Kid Thomas Valentine, whom Bastien had first witnessed playing at a neighborhood dance, at the Westwego Louisiana firehall. Bastien also gained a reputation for outlasting the revolving door of bar owners at Grossmans Tavern, and having personalities such as Woody Allen appear with him onstage.\nOn February 8, 2003 Bastien died of a heart attack in his Toronto apartment. After Bastien's passing, tenor saxophone player Patrick Tevlin switched to the trumpet in order to take on the leadership of the group.\n\n\n== Repertoire ==\nThe singers and composers whose material they favor include Kid Thomas Valentine, King Oliver, Fats Domino, George Kewis, Johnny Cash, Glenn Miller, Hank Williams, Frank Sinatra and Bob Dylan.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nTheir music has been praised by music critics for its authenticity.\n\nNew Orleans jazz is alive and well and has taken root in, of all places, Toronto, Canada. The setting is live, the music is all New Orleans jazz swing, and the band seems to be having a heck of a party. Bourbon Street beckons for this kind of sound.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Happy Pals Website\nThe Happy Pals at Bandcamp\n\"We Ain't Rich or Famous but We're The Happy Pals\" A documentary on the Happy Pals"

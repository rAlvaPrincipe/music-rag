    "text": "Saturday Looks Good to Me is an American experimental indie pop band that formed in 1999. The group is led by singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Fred Thomas (former member of His Name Is Alive). Albums by the group are known for soundscapes which hearken back to Detroit soul.\nThe band was originally conceived as a basement recording project and did not play any live shows until 2002. The band built up a considerable following on the back of numerous limited-edition 7\" record and CD-R releases, resulting in the indie pop albums All Your Summer Songs, released in 2003 on Polyvinyl Records, and Every Night, released in 2004 on Polyvinyl. All Your Summer Songs was listed as one of the top 50 albums of 2003 by Pitchfork. Every Night introduced new singer Betty Marie Barnes, who became the nearest to a permanent female singer that the band ever had.\nBy 2007, Barnes had semi-left the band and Thomas took over as the band's sole front person. SLGTM's music also changed and the resulting Fill Up The Room (2007, K Recs) album was more adventurous both lyrically and musically than the band's previous two albums.\nFollowing another European tour in 2008, Thomas retired the band to concentrate on other projects including City Center, and his record label, Life Like.\nThe band reunited in 2012 with a changed line-up, and released \"Sunglasses\" on Polyvinyl Records. For Record Store Day 2012, All Your Summer Songs was re-issued on white vinyl in a special limited edition of 250. The band released One Kiss Ends It All in 2013, and continued touring into 2015.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSaturday Looks Good to Me (hereforeveralways, 2000)\nCruel August Moon (Little Hands, 2001)\nLove Will Find You (Whistletap, 2002)\nAll Your Summer Songs (Polyvinyl, 2003)\nEvery Night (Polyvinyl, 2004)\nSound on Sound (Redder Records, 2006)\nFill Up the Room (K Records / How Does It Feel To Be Loved, 2007)\nOne Kiss Ends It All (Polyvinyl, 2013)\n\n\n=== Other releases ===\nCassingle Series #3 (Sanitary Records, April 2006)\n\"The Girl Is Distracted\"\nGreen Mansions (limited tour EP)\n\"Money in the Afterlife\" / \"All the Sidewalk Birds\" (Ernest Jenning Record Co., February 20, 2007)\nCold Colors EP (Polyvinyl – July 24, 2007)\n\"Dianne Falling Off Her Horse\" / \"Springtime Judgment\" (Ernest Jenning Record Co., July 8, 2008)\n\"Saturday Looks Good to Me : Tour Tape\" cassette (Life Like – 2012)\n\"Sunglasses\" (Polyvinyl, 2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSaturday Looks Good to Me plays Typing at PSL\nSaturday Looks Good to Me at AllMusic"

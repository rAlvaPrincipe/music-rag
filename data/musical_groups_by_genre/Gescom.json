    "text": "Gescom is an electronic music project based in the UK with close ties to the electronic duo Autechre.\nStylistically, the music of Gescom is closer to electronic dance music, acid techno, and industrial music than Autechre's, with the exception of a few conceptual remixes (and Minidisc, see below). Notable releases include Key Nell, Minidisc, and ISS:SA.\n\n\n== Members ==\nSean Booth of Autechre describes Gescom as an umbrella project involving 20 or 30 people. However, since most of their releases are anonymous, the exact roster of the project is not widely known.\n\nAutechre's debut album, Incunabula, has the motto \"Gescom 'pleasure is our business'\" printed on the spine of the packaging, and thanks to \"Darrell Fitton 4 Gescom\" in the liner notes.\nAutechre's remix EP Basscad has the motto \"Gescom 'pleasure is our business'\" printed on the inside spine of the CD, and \"Autechre Music Systems from Gescom Transcendental\" in the liner notes.\nThe Gescom EP credits \"conspirators\" as Sean Booth and Rob Brown (Autechre), Darrell Fitton (alias Bola), Rob Hall (from Skam Records), and Daniel 72 (a musician and designer near Manchester).\nThe Gescom 2 EP credits its \"conspirators\" as Sean Booth and Rob Brown (Autechre), and Andy Maddocks (from Skam Records).\nThe Key Nell EP just says, \"Conceived & secreted by Gescom.\"\nThe Keynell remixes EP just says, \"Conceived & secreted by Gescom. Additional nurturing & care from Autechre.\"\nThe This EP credits remixes to \"Ae\" (Autechre), and Velocity Kendall.\nThe That EP credits remixes to Tara, Pharoid with Time Chamber, Gescom, and DC Duo's.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n(1994) Gescom E.P.

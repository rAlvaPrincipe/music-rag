    "text": "Tribe of Judah was an American rock and roll group formed by vocalist Gary Cherone after his brief 1998 stint with Van Halen. \nTribe of Judah featured musicians Cherone had worked with in the band Extreme: bassist Pat Badger and drummer Mike Mangini. An eponymous EP was released in 2001 and a full-length album was released in late 2002. \nTribe of Judah is different from Cherone's other work as it features a more industrial/electronic sound. At least one song, \"Left for Dead\", was (supposedly) slated to be a track on a follow-up Van Halen album which would have featured Cherone.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nExit Elvis (2002)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nEast of Paradise (2001)\n\n\n== Members ==\nGary Cherone – vocals\nSteve Ferlazzo – keyboards\nMike Mangini – drums\nPat Badger – bass, vocals\nLeo Mellace – guitar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInterview with Gary Cherone by The Breakdown Room"

    "text": "Dead by Sunrise (formerly known as Snow White Tan) was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles, California in 2005 by vocalist Chester Bennington who was best known as the lead vocalist of Linkin Park. The band also consisted of Amir Derakh, Ryan Shuck, Brandon Belsky, Elias Andra, and Anthony \"Fu\" Valcic from Julien-K and Orgy. Dead by Sunrise's debut studio album, Out of Ashes, was released worldwide on October 13, 2009.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Out of Ashes (2005–2009) ===\nDead by Sunrise started to form in 2005 while Chester Bennington was writing songs for Linkin Park's album Minutes to Midnight. According to Bennington, \"I came up with a few songs that felt and sounded really good, but I knew they weren't right stylistically for Linkin Park. They were darker and moodier than anything I'd come up with for the band. So I decided to work on them on my own rather than turn them over and have them transformed into Linkin Park tracks.\" However, the foundation for Dead by Sunrise was laid much earlier, when future bandmate Shuck met Bennington during the recording of Linkin Park's first album Hybrid Theory. In an interview, Shuck states that \"I always used to go to his house and hear him play acoustic guitar. And I always thought to myself, 'Oh my God, these are such good songs.'\"\nThe band's name, which was previously \"Snow White Tan\", reflects the time during the album's recording. In an interview, Bennington stated that:\n\nI came up with the band name because in the beginnings of making this album, I was partying ... we'll call it partying. It wasn't much fun, but we partied a lot. And there was a lot of times where I was kind of in a really self-destructive place, and sometimes it felt like you weren't sure if you were going to make it to the next day. The name kind of evolved from that lifestyle, and the title of the record, Out of Ashes, is kind of coming out of that self-destructive path I was on, and rising from the ashes, so to speak.\n\nOn May 10, 2008, Dead by Sunrise performed three songs (\"Walking in Circles\", \"Morning After\", and \"My Suffering\") at the 13th anniversary party for Club Tattoo in Tempe, Arizona. The song titled \"Morning After\" was written by Chester Bennington and originally performed on September 12, 2001, at the Live in Berlin concert. Bennington also performed Morning After with his cover band entitled Bucket Of Weenies in many shows throughout 2005 and 2006. This was the first time that Bennington had \"officially\" performed the song under a new name—Dead by Sunrise. In addition, this band toured with Linkin Park in Europe, Japan, and America. In an interview with MTV, Bennington stated that \"we're actually going to be jumping in the middle of Linkin Park's set, playing a few songs, then jumping out and letting LP finish out the set.\" During their debut European tour the band took time out to send a message to the German Armed Forces.\nRecording of the band's debut album began in July 2008 after touring for Linkin Park had finished. Working simultaneously on his solo album and Linkin Park's next record, Bennington recorded Out of Ashes with producer Howard Benson and bandmates from Julien-K. Bennington wrote most of the songs on an acoustic guitar before working with his band to reshape the track into hard rock, a ballad, or even removing all rock influence and creating a synth-driven track. Linkin Park bandmate Mike Shinoda confirmed that Out of Ashes is \"much more of a rock album [than Linkin Park's albums].\" Also of note, Bennington participated in all aspects of creating the record, including programming and production. Out of Ashes was described as grunge, pop rock, and punk rock by critics.\nVideos were filmed for \"Crawl Back In\" (September 8, 2009) and \"Let Down\" with the songs serving as the album's first two singles. \"Crawl Back In\" reached the 11th spot on the Mainstream Rock chart.\n\n\n=== Later career, hiatus, and death of Chester Bennington (2010–2018) ===\nIn a 2009 interview with Billboard, Bennington said that \"This isn't a one-time thing for us. Every five years or so I could imagine there'd be a Dead By Sunrise record.\" Despite this, in 2010, he stated there was a small chance a new album may be created. The frontman also noted that because of Linkin Park's new direction \"it becomes very difficult to choose where the songs that he writes will go.\"\nOn November 4, 2011, Bennington's wife, Talinda, revealed that Dead by Sunrise will perform at the 2011 Stars of the Season Gala event, which focused on raising donations for pediatric rehabilitation.\nOn April 20, 2012, during a Love and Death concert played at an event by The Whosoevers, Elias Andra announced that in December 2011 he had left the band. Later that year the band replaced Andra with Frank Zummo from Street Drum Corps. The band had been inactive since this time.\nOn July 20, 2017, lead vocalist Chester Bennington died by suicide in his home in California. The band made an official statement on their Facebook page on July 29. Band members Ryan Shuck and Amir Derakh along with Grey Daze member Mace Beyers were united to perform a tribute for Bennington in an acoustic concert on September 2 in Las Vegas.\nThey later took part in Linkin Park's memorial concert for Chester Bennington on October 27, 2017. They performed \"One Step Closer\" alongside Korn vocalist Jonathan Davis.\nIn September 2018, Julien-K performed the One More Light 2 memorial in Milan Italy to honor Chester Bennington with a massive number of Italian fans. They performed as Julien-K and ended the set as Dead By Sunrise along with Italian guest singers.\n\n\n== Members ==\nChester Bennington – lead vocals (2005–2012; died 2017)\nAmir Derakh – lead guitar (2005–2012; 2017)\nRyan Shuck – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2005–2012; 2017)\nElias Andra – drums, percussion (2009–2011)\nBrandon Belsky – bass (2009–2012)\nAnthony \"Fu\" Valcic – keyboards, synthesizers (2009–2012)\nFrank Zummo – drums (2012)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== Promotional singles ====\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References =="

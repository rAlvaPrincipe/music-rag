    "text": "Deist Requiem is an industrial rock band from Virginia Beach, Virginia, founded by frontman Kyzer Kooper (born William Alan Cooper in 1973 in Kingsport, Tennessee). The band was signed to Warhead Records America for its self-titled CD which was produced by Martin Atkins (Pigface, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails). After dropping the label as a result of disputes over rights and money [1][2], the band then went out on their own label, Sacrifice Records.\nThe band toured across the United States for several years, gaining a large underground following, while opening for bands such as Alice Cooper, Scorpions, Gwar, Marilyn Manson, Morbid Angel, Kid Rock, Sevendust, Sister machine Gunn, La Guns, Hate Dept, King's X (Poundhound with Dug Pinnick), Boiler, Dog Fashion Disco, Overkill, Nile, Staind, The Dave Brockie Experience, Bongzilla, Bad Religion, Wednesday 13, Lamb of God and many more. DEIST REQUIEM was signed and endorsed by Jägermeister in 1998 and was one of the first in the Jäger band promotion. After disbanding in 2002, Kyzer Kooper and the co-founding guitar player David Wright joined with keyboardist Toad and bassist Jeff Daye to form DEVIL JOY, they released one CD called The Fine Art of Failure in 2006.\nIn 2009, Kyzer Kooper formed the band America's Most Rotten. The band went on a small number of tours, recorded a CD, and promptly disbanded. However, the CD was never released. In 2010, Kooper reformed DEIST with Red Burke (bass), Lucky Riggs (guitar) and Scott Stewart (drums) for a series of concerts.\nIn 2011, former drummer Jodi Joy joined Universal Records recording artist Hear Kitty Kitty, as of 2012 Joy was no longer with the band.\nFormer bass player Brian Powers is now a member of the country group Phoenix Drive.\nFormer guitar player Brance Arnold is one half of the country duo Chacho and Brance. They are regulars on the nationally syndicated show Troubadour TX.\nThe 2013 horror film Music Store Massacre starring David Meadows and Gordon Price featured 4 songs by the band. Lead singer Kyzer Kooper also made his film debut under his real name William Cooper.[3]\nDeist Requiem returned to the stage October 19, 2013 at Zakk's in Murfreesboro, North Carolina. This was then followed by Halloween Night at Jewish Mother in Virginia Beach, VA on October 31, 2013.\nWork on CD recorded at GWAR's Slave Pit Studio is complete and will be released March 3, 2015 via Sacrifice Records. The CD will be titled \"The Happiness Delusion\". This is the last recordings to feature what some consider the 'classic' line up. The CD was Produced, Mixed and Mastered by h3, singer of hERETICS iN tHE lAB.[4]\nMarch 21, 2015 at The Riff House in Chesapeake, Va Mark Flyge (Former Bane, 8 Fraud guitarist) performed his first show with Deist Requiem.

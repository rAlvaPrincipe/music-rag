    "text": "The Hrsmn (styled The HRSMN; pronounced \"Horsemen\") is an American hip hop supergroup consisting of the artists Canibus, Ras Kass, Killah Priest, and Kurupt. They have released two albums. The name of the group is in reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who appear in the Book of Revelation from the Bible. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are traditionally named Pestilence, War, Famine, and Death. Throughout the HRSMN songs, there are many references to each of the members representing a specific entity. They are  Pestilence (Ras Kass), War (Canibus), Famine (Kurupt), and Death (Killah Priest). They have each frequently appeared on each of the members solo albums, such as Canibus's 2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus) and Killah Priest's Priesthood. Pharoahe Monch was also closely affiliated, acting as the hype man on the leaked \"I'm a Horseman (Promo)\" and rapping on \"Horsemen\" from Canibus's 2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus). In August 2000, Canibus listed Monch as the fifth member of the group, though further releases in subsequent years would not include or reference him.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1997 ===\nOn January 14, the Rhyme & Reason: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released, it featured the first collaboration between Ras Kass and Canibus on a track entitled Uni-4-Orm.\n\n\n=== 1998 ===\nLate in March a white label appeared featuring a Hrsmn track titled Abide By. The track featured the same lyrics as later heard in Horsementality (from Canibus's 2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus)), and the beat was from the E-Swift produced Hip Hop Drunkies from the album Likwidation by Tha Alkaholiks.  On September the 22nd Ras Kass's second album Rasassination was released, it featured the first collaboration between Ras Kass and Kurupt.\n\n\n=== 1999 ===\nIn February in an interview for The Source, Kurupt stated that Dr. Dre and Daz Dillinger would be helping with production on the Hrsmn album.  As of now the idea of Dr. Dre and Daz Dillinger handling production on a Hrsmn album has never come to fruition. On October 19 Pharoahe Monch's debut solo album Internal Affairs was released, it featured the first collaboration between Canibus and Pharoahe Monch.\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\nOn May 9 Killah Priest's second album View from Masada was released. The album featured two Hrsmn collaborations, the first was a song called What Part of the Game? which featured Ras Kass, and the second was Bop Your Head which featured Canibus. There is also a shoutout in the sleeve stating \"Four Horsemen, Canibus, Ras Kass, (Kurupt catch you on the next one)\", meaning he was planning on working with Kurupt on his next album. The words \"Horsemen, Horsemen\" are also briefly repeated by Killah Priest on the outro track.\nOn August 20 in an interview with RapReviews.com Canibus shed some light on the status of The Hrsmn. He stated the name would be changed from \"The Four Horsemen\" to just \"Horsemen\", and under this title Ras Kass, Pharoahe Monch, Killah Priest, and Kurupt would be appearing on his new album, 2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus). He also mentions the idea of other members joining the group, such as Lonnie B and Danja Mowf (from the Supafriendz), and that they are currently looking for more members.\n\n\n=== 2003 ===\nIn September Killah Priest stated in an interview that he had not spoken to Ras Kass since he had been locked up but he did say \"we’re still going to do the HRSMN joint.\" Later on in the same month ripthejacker.net reported that Canibus had \"been quite busy along with Killah Priest and Ras Kass. They have begun re-recording and building the HRSMN album! It will feature a cast of emcees not before a part of the group and it will be out the Summer of 2004 on Mic Club. Updates will be included in a new Media News section at Micclub.net so stay tuned.\" A Hrsmn album was never released in 2004 on Mic Club and a \"Media News\" section on the website never appeared. Also in September during an interview Canibus sparked rumors that other members would be joining the group such as Crooked I, Pak Man, Kool G Rap, Royce Da 5'9\", Keith Murray, Journalist, Common, Rakim, Vinnie Paz (from Jedi Mind Tricks), Pace Won and Young Zee (from the Outsidaz), and Lonnie B and Danja Mowf (from the Supafriendz).\nIn October, Killah Priest and Dreddy Kruger released a nine track album entitled The Horsemen Project, it was released independently through Think Differently Music/Proverbs Music Inc. and was only available to purchase off the internet. Each track featured at least two members of the group as well as an appearance by Pak Man. It is currently unknown who handled the majority of the production on the album, although it is known that Mark Sparks was responsible for two songs.\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\nDuring January in an interview conducted by AllHipHop.com, Ras Kass stated that Kurupt had contacted him while he was in prison, and that he was currently looking for a major label to distribute a new Hrsmn album.\n\n\n=== 2005 ===\nDuring March an apparently unreleased Hrsmn track was to emerge on Pak Man's debut album Chow Time, unfortunately the track turned out to be the previously released Horsemen Are Here (which also featured on The Horsemen Project under the shorter title Horsemen). Once again during March, another apparently unreleased Hrsmn track was set to appear in the form of a collaboration with Canibus and Kurupt. The track, titled Not 4 Play, was scheduled to appear on Canibus's new album Mind Control, unfortunately it turned out to be the previously released Scrolls from The Horsemen Project.\nTowards the end of March during an interview with RasKass-Central.com, Ras Kass shed some light on the status of a new Hrsmn album:-\n\nWe gonna do it, but we gotta do it the right way. It’s cool that Killah Priest let the people get the stuff we did. He gave it to the world and I’m never mad at that. But I don’t think that should be the judgment of what the HRSMN could be, that was just what we was doing at that time. When we do the HRSMN shit it’ll be right. I got big visions for what that album could really be. That shit could be crazy, but it’s gotta be right. Kurupt has some legal contractual shit that he needs to fix, as do I. When shit is right that’s when you do shit. So we’ll do it when shit is right.\nFor an interview conducted with ThaFormula.com, Killah Priest stated that various members have tracks that were recorded, and he hopes that they can once again come together.\nEarly in November in an interview with HipHopSite.com Ras Kass stated that once he can sort out his own \"business\" he would be interest in recording a new Hrsmn album. On November 18 in an interview conducted with HipHopDX.com Ras Kass once again stated his interest in working with The Hrsmn. \nTowards the end of November during an interview conducted by WuForever.com Killah Priest stated that a new Hrsmn album would be recorded.\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\nOn January 23 it was announced that the main members will be present on Killah Priest's then upcoming album The Offering. On Killah Priest's May 1 journal entry at HipHopGame.com he mentioned The Hrsmn and the possibility of a new album. He said \"The Horsemen project is definitely going to come. Right now we just have to get Kurupt. He's been doing the Dogg Pound thing, but it's definitely going to come. We have songs recorded and we have more in store.\"\n\n\n=== 2007 ===\nOn the Canibus album For Whom the Beat Tolls Killah Priest is featured together with Sun on the track Liquid Wordz. The Hrsmn also collaborate on Killah Priest's album The Offering on the song \"Inner G\", produced by 4th Disciple.\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nRecently, member Kurupt announced plans to effect a Hrsmn reunion album featuring himself, Canibus, Killah Priest and Ras Kass. It was later reported that the group had reformed, with business-related assistance from M-Eighty, A&R and executive producer of Canibus' Melatonin Magik. Recently The Hrsmn have appeared on a track from Ras Kass' newest album 'A.D.I.D.A.S'. In an August 2010 radio interview with Mista Montana, Killah Priest discussed the creation of the Four Horsemen album, stating that they plan to bring in producers from all their camps.\n\n\n=== 2011 ===\nIn 2011, a video appeared announcing a summer release date for the group's album. Member Ras Kass described it as a \"sintro,\" or alternately a \"trailer,\" featuring text lyrics to a song called \"The End is Near.\" Kass went on to divulge that the Wu-Tang Clan's RZA will be executive-producing the album, and will produce \"two or three\" tracks for the album. The group hopes to land production from DJ Premier. Guest appearances will include RBX (their upcoming first single, \"Impossible\"), RZA, Ghostface Killah and Prodigal Sunn of the Wu-Tang camp, while Mos Def and Pharoahe Monch are \"listed as possibilities.\"\nPreviously, group member Kurupt revealed that a collaboration with Slaughterhouse was in the works, listing possible titles as \"House of Horses\" and \"The Four Slaughters.\"\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\nOn January 28, 2012, Ras Kass announced that he was resigning from The Hrsmn, and is no longer a part of the group.\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\nIn February 2014, there was a post of a few pictures on Twitter and Facebook by Ras Kass and also Canibus & Kurupt's A&R Matthew Markoff with a picture of Kurupt, Ras Kass, & Killah Priest and the words HRSMN 2014. Markoff also added that there will be a new recorded HRSMN track released soon and album coming later.\nA new HRSMN track with all the original four members called Historic (featuring Tragedy Khadafi) appeared on Canibus' new album Fait Accompli.\nOn June 3, 2014, Ras Kass reunited with the group.\n\n\n=== 2015 ===\nIn 2015, Killah Priest and Kurupt appeared on Canibus' 14th solo release Time Flys, Life Dies...Phoenix Rise - Killah Priest appeared on a song titled, \"Bronze Horses\" referring to Bronze Nazareth who produced the album. Kurupt appeared on the track titled \"The Kings Sent For Me (Samurydas Remix) \".\n\n\n=== 2021 ===\nOn January 8, 2021, Ras Kass released a new Hrsmn track titled \"Apocalips Now\" on his Bandcamp website. The second Hrsmn album, titled The Last Ride, was released on June 18, 2021.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nThe Horsemen Project (2003)\nThe Last Ride (2021)\nEPs\n\nHistoric EP (2014)\nGuest appearances (group)\n\n1998 \"Abide By\" (from a White label promo 12\" vinyl)\n2000 \"Horsementality\" (from the Canibus album 2000 B.C.

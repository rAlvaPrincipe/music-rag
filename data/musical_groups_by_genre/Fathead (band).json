They are multiple Juno Award and Maple Blues Award winners. Their distinguished musical career was so honoured by the Juno Awards as early as 1999 and again in 2008. They were awarded their first Maple Blues Award as early as 1997 for Electric Act of the Year. Fathead came together in the late 1980s with no intention of becoming a permanent band; they were a pick up gig. Lerman worked for close to a year with a variety of musicians. When he noticed it was the same musicians coming out to play each time, they all realized they were onto something. They became the long-standing members of the newly formed band  in 1992, which Lerman named Fathead after a recording he had by David Fathead Newman.\n\n\n== Musicians ==\nJohn Mays (born 1941) in Georgia grew up with southern Gospel music.

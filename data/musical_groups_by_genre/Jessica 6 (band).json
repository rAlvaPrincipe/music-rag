    "text": "Jessica 6 is the electronic pop performing alias of Nomi Ruiz which began as a Brooklyn-based Nu-disco and R&B trio that formed after helping put together the Hercules and Love Affair live show. Formerly known as Deep Red,  their name was taken from the lead character of the same name from the 1967 novel Logan's Run.\n\n\n== History ==\nNomi Ruiz first met Andrew Raposo and Morgan Wiley in late 2007 after they helped put together the Hercules and Love Affair live show, but didn't form the band until 2008. The band's bassist Andrew Raposo stated that the band formed after “Nomi [Ruiz] brought over a kick-pattern and a song she’d written called ‘Fun Girl.'” Raposo first met Wiley in college before joining the now defunct DFA produced hip-hop act Automato together. The single \"Fun Girl\" was later released in October 2009 through the label Midnight Sun Sound.\nIn 2010, Jessica 6 added drummer Jim Orso to the band, and also contributed a cover of David Bowie's \"I'm Deranged\" to the tribute album We Were So Turned On: A Tribute to David Bowie.\nAfter signing to Peacefrog Records, Jessica 6 released the single \"White Horse\" on 7 January 2011. The music video for the song premiered on Perez Hilton's website on 28 February 2011. \"White Horse\" was released as a free download on RCRD LBL. \"White Horse\" became a minor hit in Belgium, peaking at number 34 on the Belgian Wallonia Ultratip Chart. To promote the album See the Light, Jessica 6 also released a limited edition vinyl of the song \"Prisoner of Love.\" \"Prisoner of Love\" features Hercules and Love Affair collaborator Antony Hegarty and was featured on Pitchfork Media.\nTheir debut album See the Light was released on 6 June 2011. The album received positive reviews from contemporary critics, earning an average score of 66/100 on the music review aggregation of Metacritic.  To coincide with the album's release, Jessica 6 released a free download of the song \"East Went Funk\" on RCRD LBL.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nJessica 6 has been influenced by Vanity 6, Apollonia 6, and Britney Spears circa Blackout. Their music is described by Allmusic as a \"mix of R&B, disco, and hip-hop -- along with healthy doses of freestyle, funk, punk, and pop.\"  Jessica 6 also identified Cuban-mafia fashion, the works of Dario Argento, and camp themes as sources of inspiration for the band's fashion and visuals.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nNomi Ruiz – vocals (2008–present)\nAndrew Rapasso – bass guitar (2008–2013)\nMorgan Wiley – keyboards (2008–2013)\nJim Orso - drums (2010-2013)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSee the Light (2011)\nThe Capricorn (2015)\nThe ELIOT Sessions (2018)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Fun Girl\" (2009)\n\"White Horse\" (2011) Belgian Wallonia Ultratip Chart #34, Belgian Dance Chart #36\n\"Prisoner of Love\" (2011)\n\"In the Heat\" (2012)\n\"Can't Tear Us Apart\" (2015)\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

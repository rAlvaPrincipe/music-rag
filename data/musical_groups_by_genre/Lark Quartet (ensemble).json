Laura was the first to imagine the quartet into existence. She had just returned home upon graduating to live with her parents in Minnesota. Laura established a non for profit status and a board before she'd fully enlisted personnel but quickly set up a meeting with Anna Kruger in New York who introduced her to Kay and Robin. Soon after, Laura applied for a Self magazine \"Fresh Start\" competition geared towards women who were starting over with a new beginning in their life. She won and the magazine took on the whole quartet. SELF paid for the quartet's NEW YORK debut.\n\n\n=== Lark About Town (LAT) ===\nA concert series that pairs private salon evenings with free concerts for families and underserved communities.

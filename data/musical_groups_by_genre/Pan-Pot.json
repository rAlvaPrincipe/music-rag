    "text": "Pan-Pot is the name of the Berlin-based techno duo, German DJs and music producers Tassilo Ippenberger and Thomas Benedix.\nSince their launch in 2005, Pan-Pot have established their presence in the modern techno scene, reaching popularity with the release of their debut album, Pan-O-Rama,  on Anja Schneider's Mobilee label.\nTheir repertoire is defined as being underground music that is independent of specific genres, primarily spanning techno and house whilst including experimental elements and IDM influences.\nThe duo are credited with producing live sets combined with vocals that are described as revealing a deep understanding of the dancefloor needs of clubs and festivals.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTassilo and Thomas met in 2003 at Berlin’s SAE Institute where they studied audio engineering. There the two producers completed  their studies in sound production and design, which helped them in defining Pan-Pot's sound aesthetic when they started producing music together.\nIn 2005, the duo booked Anja Schneider for one of their events, which coincidentally gave them the opportunity to establish a favorable connection with her then nascent Mobilee imprint. After a few weeks the label launched their second release, which was Pan-Pot's official debut, \"Copy and Paste\". Since then a steady stream of tracks and remixes have been released on Mobilee and Einmaleins Musik.\nThe defining moment of Pan-Pot’s career came in 2007, with the release of their debut artist album, Pan-O-Rama. Tracks such as \"Charly\" and \"Captain My Captain\" became hits, which made the artists known for their blend of melodic and plain techno and house.\nIn 2014, Pan-Pot launch the imprint, Second State, signing Amelie Lens and moving into a new chapter of their career.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums and EPs ===\n\"Maffia\" – (Einmaleins Musik, 2004)\n\"Popy & Caste\" – (Mobilee, 2005)\n\"Obscenity\" – (Mobilee, 2005)\n\"Pious Sin\" – (Einmaleins Musik, 2006)\n\"Black Lodge\" – (Mobilee, 2006)\n\"What Is What\" – (Mobilee, 2007)\n\"Charly\" – (Mobilee, 2007)\nPan-O-Rama – (Mobilee, 2007)\n\"Lost Tracks\" – (Mobilee, 2008)\n\"Confronted\" – (Mobilee, 2009)\n\"Confronted (The Remixes)\" – (Mobilee, 2009)\n\"Captain My Captain\" – (Mobilee, 2010)\n\"Captain My Captain Remixes\" – (Mobilee, 2011)\n\"Gravity\" – (Mobilee, 2012)\"\n\"White Fiction\" – (Mobilee, 2012)\nMobilee Back to Back Vol.6, Presented by Pan-Pot (Mobilee collection, 2012)\nThe Mirror - (Mobilee, 2013)\nCells - (Second State Audio, 2014)\nGrey Matter - (Second State Audio, 2014)\nWatergate Compilation 17 - (Watergate Records, 2014)\nConductor - (Watergate Records, 2014)\nThe Other - (Second State Audio, 2015)\nThe Other Remixes - (Second State Audio, 2015)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nMathias Schaffhäuser – \"Lost Vox\" (2005)\nEnliven Deep Acoustics – \"Over\" (2006)\nMisc. – \"Frequenzträger\" (2006)\nAnja Schneider & Sebo K – \"Rancho Relaxo\" (2006)\nFeldah & Koba – \"Is Klar\" (2006)\nSweet 'n Candy – \"Scrollmops\" (2007)\nDamian Schwartz – \"Verde Confetti\" (2007)\nTim Xavier – \"Deception De Real\" (2007)\nDapayk Solo – \"Hagen\" (2007)\nAndomat 3000 feat.

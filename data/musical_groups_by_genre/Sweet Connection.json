Active for a short period between 1988 and 1990, they were notable for their debut song \"Need Your Passion\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Original lineup ===\nBehind the project was euro disco record producer Luis Rodriguez, better known for his work with Modern Talking and C. C. Catch, with songwriter-producer Reinhardt Frantz (New Baccara, Casablanca, Pepper Girls). The group's image revolved around the sexy dichotomy of a sultry blonde and brunette.\nThe duo originally consisted of brunette June LaVonne Polichio (born December 27, 1959, Los Angeles, United States) (former lead singer of 'The Pinups', a German-based Californian group) and blonde Inge Schaubschl√§ger (born December 20, 1966, Wolfratshausen, Germany), a glamour model. The duo released their debut single \"Need Your Passion\" in 1988, which became a European club hit, Hit Nr.1 in Japan.\nAt the end of the year followed their second single \"Dirty Job\".\n\n\n=== New lineup ===\nIn 1989 the duo was replaced with two new singers with aliases Billie Joe aka Billie aka Billie Kaman (real name) and Sue Dixie (real name). Unlike the early incarnation, both artists were co-writing the songs. The duo released two highly successful singles for the following two years (\"Heart To Heart\" and \"Love Bites\") before dissolving in breaking up in 1991.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nAlthough an album was never leased during their active career, in 2008, a compilation album titled after their hit debut song, Need Your Passion, was released by an independent record label DWS Records. It featured all of Sweet Connection's singles and remixes.\nThe brunette of the first lineup, June LaVonne, currently resides in Germany and is still actively involved in music under the alias of Bonnie Benedict. She also runs a private English teaching course in Hamburg.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1988 - \"Need Your Passion\"\n1988 - \"Dirty Job\"\n1989 - \"Heart To Heart\"\n1990 - \"Love Bites\"\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2008 - Need Your Passion (compilation album)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Port Jackson Jazz Band were an Australian Dixieland jazz group formed in 1944 and based in Sydney. They were the longest running traditional jazz band in Australia and performed into the 1990s, though they had multiple breakups.\n\n\n== History ==\nTrombonist Jack Parkes formed the Port Jackson Jazz Band in 1944. Other original founding members included trumpeter Ken Flannery, but the roster evolved as military service and other commitments saw the band occasionally interrupted. They made their debut recording in 1945 which was unissued. It featured Parkes, Flannery, Alf Freeney (piano), John Sweeney (banjo), Duke Farrell (bass, vocals), and Mal Cooper (drums). Other recordings were made which were played by Sydney radio stations.\nIn 1947 Ray Price joined the then seven-piece band as their business manager / musical director, and played guitar and banjo in the rhythm section. That year the band made headlines when they refused to play at Sydney's Air Force House due to a \"color ban\" put in place by the venue management. The band members were all ex-servicemen and spoke out against racial prejudice and continued to play elsewhere. Their repertoire included tradition African-American music from the 1920s. In early 1948 the ensemble were the first artists to perform jazz at Sydney Conservatorium of Music. After an interstate tour where the band were accused of communist sympathies, the band broke up in 1948. Ken Flannery was the only remaining original founding member at this time, and he reformed the group the following year without Price.\nIn 1949 the band featured Ken Flannery (trumpet), Jim Somerville (piano), Bob Rowan (trombon), Ron Mannix (clarinet), Clive Whitecombe (drums), Doug Beck (guitar), and Bill Farmer (bass).\nDuring the late 1940s, the band performed with singers Georgia Lee (singer) and Nellie Small in Sydney and Newcastle, with Small said to have stolen the show during her appearance with the jazz band.\nAt the end of 1950, the Ken Flannery led band had broken up again, with only occasional reunions across the next five years.\nRay Price reformed the Port Jackson Jazz Band and performed as a member between 1955-1962.\nIn 1960 the band were part of the 1st Annual Australian International Jazz Festival in Sydney, billed as \"Ray Price & The Port Jackson Jazz Band\". During the 1960s, they played regularly as a quartet at a hotel in Sydney, but would come together as a seven-piece for concerts or recordings. One of these recordings was Jazz Classics Volume 1, credited to Ray Price and his Port Jackson Jazz Band.\nAfter Ray Price retired in 1982, he occasionally rejoined The Port Jackson Jazz Band for reunions until his death in 1990.\nIn 1988 the band reformed again with Ken Flannery as their only surviving original member. He was joined by pianist Dick Hughes, clarinetist John McCarthy, drummer Allan Geddes, bassists Wally Wickham and Harry Harmon. Later reunions featured other members, new and old.\n\n\n== Lineup ==\nThe Port Jackson Jazz Band has had an evolving membership.

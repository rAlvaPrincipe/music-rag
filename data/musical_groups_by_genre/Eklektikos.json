    "text": "eklektikos is a classical chamber music ensemble specializing in the performance of music by contemporary Canadian composers. Based in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada, its core members include Dale Sorensen (trombone and artistic director), Morgan Saulnier (flute), Karem Simon (clarinet), and Richard Covey (piano).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe contemporary classical chamber music ensemble eklektikos was founded in 2002 by PEI trombonist Dale Sorensen, the group's current artistic director. That same year the ensemble recorded the score for Picking Lucy's Brain, a film written and directed by Jason Rogerson, with original music composed by Barrie Sorensen. The group was also featured at the 2002 Canadian Acoustical Association's national conference, which was held in Charlottetown.\nAs part of its commitment to the performance of Canadian music, eklektikos has been invited several times to participate in the Canadian Music Centre's New Music in New Places project. Funded by SOCAN and the Government of Canada through their Canada Music Fund, this program was created to disseminate the music of Canadian composers to a wider public by presenting performances in non-traditional venues. Some of eklektikos' performances were held at the Charlottetown Mall (April 2005), the Charlottetown Farmers Market (2008), the Charlottetown Toyota car dealership (November 2009), and the Charlottetown Airport (March 2011).\nSeveral new compositions have been created through grants that eklektikos has received from the PEI Council of the Arts. One of these projects resulted in the creation of new works by eight PEI composers, all of which were premiered by eklektikos in March 2005. Another project, in July 2007, facilitated the creation of new works by four young Atlantic Canadian composers who were mentored by Jim O'Leary during a 4-day workshop which culminated in a public performance of all the new works.\neklektikos regularly performs on the recital series at the UPEI Music Department, where all of the ensemble members serve on faculty.\n\n\n== Premieres ==\neklektikos has given the world premiere performances of the following 23 compositions, most of which were written by Canadian composers, including 16 works by Prince Edward Island composers.\n\nW.L.

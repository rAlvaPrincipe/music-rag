Following a hiatus, they reunited under Slam Dunk Records.\nThe band released seven extended plays and four studio albums in their career. The debut album, Never Happy, Ever After, was released by Fearless Records in April 2015; the second album, okay., was released in January 2017; the third album, The Great Depression, was released in August 2018; and the band's latest album, I Went to Hell and Back, was released in February 2022.

In August 2024, the group announced a reunion for 2025 consisting of Foley, Langford-Biss, Testo and Walters.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and Never Happy, Ever After (2012–2016) ===\nAs It Is was formed in spring 2012 by Minnesota-born Patrick Walters, who posted an advertisement stating that he was looking for musicians to be in a pop-punk band using the online service Join My Band. Andrew Westhead and Patrick Foley replied to the advertisement and were accepted into the band along with Benjamin Biss, who Walters knew from university. The band's name comes from a lyric in a song by the American straight edge hardcore band Have Heart.\nWalters began his own career by posting song covers on his personal YouTube channel. After the band's formation, the band as a whole worked on a cover of Fat Lip by Sum 41. As the band's career started to gain more traction, he posted less often until he finally announced in the video, titled \"A New Chapter\", that he would go on an undetermined hiatus for the channel and would be focusing his efforts on As It Is. He has since made clear that he has no intention of returning to YouTube.\nIn early 2014 they added bassist Alistair Testo, The band played local shows for the first couple of years before their first few tours shortly after releasing their fourth EP This Mind of Mine, touring the UK and Europe. The band received a large response from these tours and signed to Fearless Records in October 2014, becoming the first UK band to sign to the label. The band members began working on the group's debut full-length album in 2014 in Florida with producer James Paul Wisner.\nThe band's debut full-length, Never Happy, Ever After was released on 20 April 2015 in Europe and the following day in the United States under Fearless Records.

The song that As It Is chose was Such Great Heights, which was originally made famous by the indie rock band The Postal Service. The album was released on 9 November 2018. Lead singer Patty Walters was also interviewed by Hopeless Records as a part of a campaign to get kids and teens to seek out help if they are going through personal struggles, which was also the overall message of the album.\nAt their show at the 02 Forum Kentish Town in London on 1 December 2018, the unofficial world record for the most crowd surfers during an hour-long was set. Over 300 people crowd surfed during the band's set, and over 600 crowd surfed across the sets of all four bands on the bill.\nThe success of The Great Depression prompted an additional release, The Great Depresssion: Reimagined, in which the band interpolated and re-adapted the original songs into new genres and sounds across a series of multiple EPs mimicking the stages laid out on the original release. The album was released in its entirety on November 8, 2019.\nOn Monday September 9, 2019 As It Is announced on their social media that Benjamin Langford-Biss would be leaving the band, the band announced an 11 date European farewell tour, supported by Southampton punk rockers Miss Vincent, to pay tribute to his departure.\nOn Tuesday December 29, 2020, As It Is announced on twitter that drummer Patrick Foley would be leaving the band to pursue a new career as a firefighter.\n\n\n=== I Went to Hell and Back and hiatus (2021–2024) ===\nOn 27 May 2021, the band released their first single as a trio titled \"IDGAF\", followed by \"I Lie to Me\" on 5 August, \"ILY, How Are You?\" and \"IDC, I Can't Take It\" on 3 September, \"I Miss 2003\" on 11 November, and \"In Threes\" on 9 December. The release of \"I Miss 2003\" came along with the announcement of the band's fourth album I Went to Hell and Back which released 4 February 2022 by Fearless Records.\nOn Tuesday, August 23, 2022, bassist Alistair Testo announced he would be leaving the band. Following Testo's departure, As It Is played that year's Reading and Leeds Festivals as a three-piece with touring musician Ross Brown returning on drums. These turned out to be their final shows before indefinite hiatus.\nIn January 2024, Patty Walters announced the group's hiatus through a rare Instagram post, stating \"Here's to another new chapter. It's never goodbye. It's just 'see you around'\", quoting his previous hiatus as a former YouTube content creator.\n\n\n=== Reunion and future plans (2025) ===\nIn August of 2024, the band's social media accounts were wiped and rebranded as \"Transatlantic pop-punk.

On September 2nd, 2024, a reunion of their best-known lineup including Walters, Biss, Foley, and Testo was announced, with plans to return in 2025.\n\n\n== Style and influences ==\nAs It Is has been described as a pop punk band with a \"melodic, earnest, emo-inspired\" sound, compared to the early material of Taking Back Sunday, The Starting Line, All Time Low, Silverstein, Underoath, My Chemical Romance, Rise Against, and AFI. The Wonder Years has been listed as a big influence. Their early material on Never Happy, Ever After has been described as more emo-pop punk. Their sophomore album okay. falls under a lot of similar genres to their debut, but notably does have a few songs on it that stand out as very different from previous work. Overtime, their styles have been considered more diverse on their later work, exploring more of the themes seen on okay. by taking a notable stylistic departure into darker territory on The Great Depression.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nPatty Walters – lead vocals, additional guitar (2012-2022, 2024-present), drums, percussion (2020-2022), bass (2022)\nBen Langford-Biss – lead and rhythm guitar, co-lead vocals (2012-2019, 2024-present)\nPatrick Foley – drums, percussion (2012-2020, 2024-present)\nAlistair Testo – bass, backing vocals (2012-2022, 2024-present)\nFormer members\n\nRonnie Ish – lead guitar, backing and co-lead vocals (2018-2022; touring member 2017-2018)\nJames Fox – bass, backing vocals (2012-2013)\nAndy Westhead – lead guitar, backing vocals (2012-2017)\nTouring members\n\nMaxx Danziger – drums (2021)\nRoss Brown – drums (2022)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Festivals ==\nVans Warped Tour 2015 (US)\nSlam Dunk Festival 2015 (UK)\nReading and Leeds 2015 (UK)\nSlam Dunk Festival 2018 (UK)\nVans Warped Tour 2018 (US)\nSlam Dunk Festival 2019 (UK)\nJera On Air Festival 2019 (NL)\n2000 Trees Festival 2019 (UK)\nGunnersville Concert Series 2019 (UK)\n\n\n== References ==\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\nBiddulph, Andy (April 2015).

    "text": "dan le sac Vs Scroobius Pip were a hip-hop duo, combining electronic beats with sung, spoken, and rapped lyrics. The pair are Daniel Stephens (a.k.a. Dan le Sac; production, programming, keyboards, guitars and backing vocals), and David Peter Meads (b.1981) (a.k.a. Scroobius Pip; vocals/rapper/poet). The name \"Scroobius Pip\" is an intentional misspelling of the Edward Lear poem \"The Scroobious Pip\".\nDan le Sac originally hails from Corringham and Scroobius Pip from neighbouring Stanford-le-Hope in Essex.\nTheir first single was \"Thou Shalt Always Kill\". Signed with the Sunday Best record label, Dan le Sac Vs Scroobius Pip released their debut album in 2008. Titled Angles, it reached 31 in the UK album chart. They released their second album entitled The Logic of Chance on 15 March 2010 on Sunday Best. Scroobius Pip released his debut solo album, entitled Distraction Pieces, on 19 September 2011 â€“ while Dan le Sac released his, Space Between the Words, on 9 July 2012. The duo's third album entitled Repent Replenish Repeat was released 7 October 2013 and debuted at number 22 in the UK top 40, the duo's highest album chart position to date.\n\n\n== History ==\nBoth Dan le Sac and Scroobius Pip worked as solo artists before forming this duo, Dan le Sac as a laptop musician, DJ and promoter, Scroobius Pip as a spoken word artist.\nDavid Meads began writing poetry in about 2005; he adopted the pseudonym \"Scroobius Pip\" from Edward Lear's poem \"The Scroobious Pip\". In a 2010 interview with Beatdom, Meads explained why he chose the name: \"I loved the story. It's about a creature that doesn't know what it is ...By the end [of the poem] he realises that he is simply The Scroobious Pip. He doesn't fit into any one category and can just be his own creature.\"\nThe duo formed in 2006 after Dan le Sac booked Scroobius Pip to play at a gig he was promoting at the Fez Club (now Sakura) in Reading. Around this time Dan le Sac started remixing Scroobius Pip's solo album No Commercial Breaks - a selection of the remixes form the core of their debut album Angles but the band didn't garner any commercial success until they wrote the original song \"Thou Shalt Always Kill\" at the end of 2006. Although it is commonly thought that Rob Da Bank of BBC Radio 1 gave the band their first radio play, it was actually John Kennedy of XFM London - the band sent a demo CD to John Kennedy in December 2006 and he played it on his Xposure show within two hours of receiving it.\n\"Thou Shalt Always Kill\" was re-released in 2009 with additional vocals by Pos Plug Won (Posdnous) of De La Soul.\nIn 2007 the duo released two singles on Lex Records, \"Thou Shalt Always Kill\" and \"The Beat that my Heart Skipped\" but it wasn't until early 2008 that they signed for Rob da Bank's Sunday Best record label and released their debut album Angles; the album was later released on Sage Francis's Strange Famous Records in the US and Traffic in Japan.\nOn Christmas Eve 2007, whilst still unsigned, the duo released a free download of \"Letter From God To Man\" which includes a sample of Radiohead's \"Planet Telex\". To promote this, the duo created and posted a spoof video on YouTube showing the pair auditioning for The X Factor in front of Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh. A montage of clips of judges' comments are added to their profanity-laden performance of what Scroobius Pip says is \"'It Ain't No Fun' by Snoop Dogg, featuring Warren G, Nate Dogg and Kurupt.\" The clip, titled \"Le Sac Vs Pip Letter from X-factor\", was featured in \"The 10 Best Clips of the Month\" in the October 2008 edition of Q magazine. The video also included a voice over from Zane Lowe.\nThey have also appeared on the BBC's Sound and NBC's Last Call with Carson Daly, with Scroobius Pip appearing by himself on the BBC's Newsnight Review and Setanta Sport Channel, as well as being interviewed and performing live on Stephen Merchant's show on BBC 6 Music.\nThey spent 2009 recording their second studio album, The Logic of Chance which was released in March 2010, preceded by the single \"Get Better\".\nIn September 2011 Scroobius Pip released his second solo album Distraction Pieces through the label Strange Famous Records (USA) and Scroobius Pip's own Speech Development Records (UK). It debuted at #35 in the UK album charts.\nIn 2011, a portrait of Scroobius Pip was painted by British artist Joe Simpson, the painting was exhibited around the UK including a solo exhibition at The Royal Albert Hall.\nIn July 2012 Dan le Sac released his debut solo album Space Between the Words on Sunday Best Records. The album features collaborations with B. Dolan, Sarah Williams White, Emmy the Great, Fraser Rowan, Joshua Idehen, HowAboutBeth, Merz and Pete Hefferan from British indie band Pete and the Pirates\nIn February 2014, Dan le Sac vs Scroobius Pip performed another UK tour, stopping off in Belfast, Northern Ireland on Valentine's Day.\nIn September 2014, Scroobius Pip announced that he and Dan le Sac had played their last show together, marking the end of their 8-year musical partnership.\n\n\n== Music and influences ==\nThe duo's music includes hip-hop, electronica, and pop.

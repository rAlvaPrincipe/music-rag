    "text": "A1 (stylised as a1) is a British–Norwegian boy group formed in 1998.\nTheir debut single, \"Be the First to Believe\", entered the UK singles chart at number six in mid-1999. They achieved chart success in the UK and other parts of the world in the late 1990s and early 2000s, particularly Southeast Asia. In the UK, they scored two number ones and six other top 10 hits, seven of which were written by the band. Adding to this, they also won a Brit Award for \"British Breakthrough Act\" in 2001. They were managed by band manager Tim Byrne, who also formed Steps.\nMarazzi left the band in 2002, citing personal reasons. The three remaining members subsequently decided to split due to exhaustion from being on the road for the best part of four years straight.\nIn December 2009, Ingebrigtsen, Read and Adams reformed a1, without Marazzi, in Norway for a series of concerts at the Christiania Theatre in Oslo. Since their comeback, they have released new singles as well as their fourth and fifth studio albums, Waiting for Daylight, in 2010, and Rediscovered, in 2012.\nIn 2014, A1 appeared on the ITV2 documentary The Big Reunion along with other bands such as Eternal, Damage, Girl Thing, 3T and a new band called 5th Story, made up of Dane Bowers (from Another Level), Gareth Gates, Kenzie (from Blazin' Squad), Kavana, and Adam Rickitt.\nIn 2017, Marazzi met his former bandmates in Newcastle after his 15-year absence, and he will appear on their 20th anniversary tour.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1998: Formation ===\nPaul Marazzi, who had missed the cut for Steps, met Tim Byrne in 1998 to talk about forming a second group. Auditions were held where Christian Ingebrigtsen, Mark Read, and Ben Adams were recruited and the band was formed by the management team of Byrne and Vicky Blood.\n\n\n=== 1999: Here We Come ===\nA1 signed with Columbia Records in February 1999 and released \"Be the First to Believe\" in Summer 1999. In November they released Here We Come, which reached number 4 in Norway and had four top ten singles in the UK.\n\n\n=== 2000–2001: The A List ===\nIn 2000, they achieved two number ones with \"Take On Me\" and \"Same Old Brand New You\". The video for their seventh single, \"No More\", was filmed in Singapore while they were on tour there. In 2001, the band began a massive arena tour of Asia, where they were very well received. During a mall signing in Indonesia, four teenage girls were killed in a stampede. In 2001, Sony Music launched a paid subscription service for a1 called 'Access All Areas', the first for an artist signed to the company. This was an early version of a social network allowing fans to meet and chat online.\n\n\n=== 2002: Make It Good, Marazzi's departure and split ===\nTheir third album, Make It Good saw a change of direction in their musical style but was to be their last studio project.

He attracted much attention later that same year when he posed naked for the cover of Attitude.\nIn 2003, Ingebrigtsen also began a solo career, with his first solo single, \"In Love With an Angel\", being released in 2004. The single stayed in the Top 10 of the Norway Singles Chart for nearly three months. The song was swiftly followed by \"Things Are Gonna Change\", which became Ingebrigsten's final solo single before he moved into other areas of showbusiness.\nIn 2002, Read focused on becoming a songwriter for other artists, after signing a deal with Metrophonic. Read has written for artists such as Charlotte Church, Boyzone, Michael Bolton, Robin Gibb, and The Hollies. Read released his debut solo single, \"Greatest Lady in My Life\", on 2 March 2009. His debut solo album, Peace at Last was released in June 2009.\nMonths after he left the band, Marazzi hosted the Andy Cole Children's Foundation (now All Star Kids) on 26 April 2003 together with Jo Good. He turned down the offer to appear in I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2004. In late 2005 he formed a soul/rock band in Sunderland, Northeast England called Snagsby.

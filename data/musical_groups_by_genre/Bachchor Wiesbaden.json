A partnership with the Royal Tunbridge Wells Choral Society in Royal Tunbridge Wells, the British sister city of Wiesbaden, was begun in 1994 and led to concerts of the combined choirs in both cities.\nThe choir has been directed by Niklas Sikner from November 2020. It is sponsored by an association of friends (Freundeskreis).\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2003 Kulturpreis der Landeshauptstadt Wiesbaden (Culture prize of the state capital Wiesbaden)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

The group played its first shows in Madison, Wisconsin in 1993, at the local Art Fair on the Square. They released four full-length albums over the next several years, and followed with the live album Delicious, recorded in Madison, in late 2002.\nThe group has done concert tours across the United States and Europe. Their 2006 live album Ascona was recorded at a Switzerland jazz festival. In December 2009 they released their fifth studio album, We Make 'Em Say Ooh, and followed up the album's release with shows during Mardi Gras season in New Orleans.

    "text": "Virgin Ground is the second album by Redgum. The title is taken from the first track.\nIt was originally released on vinyl and cassette. It was available on CD between 1990 and 1992, and has been out of print ever since, although some tracks were included on the 2004 collection Against the Grain.\nThe band were all working day jobs during recording. They would fly from Adelaide to Melbourne on a Friday, play a gig to pay for the trip, and then record all weekend.\" This album led to the band becoming more popular and becoming full-time musicians.\nThe title track tells the story of the New Australia Colony established in Paraguay in 1893 by a group of Australians led by William Lane, seeking a fresh start on \"virgin ground\" to establish a utopian society. Other tracks offer bleak insight into current social issues including chronic unemployment, the plight of migrant women, foreign domination of Australian business and government, and the apathy of 'middle Australia'. \"Women in Change\" features the last 4 stanzas from Lesbia Harford's poem \"Periodicity\", commenting on a woman's menstrual cycle.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nSide A\n\"Virgin Ground\" (M.

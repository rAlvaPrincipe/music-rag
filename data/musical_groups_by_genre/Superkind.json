Super kind debuted on June 20, 2022, with the digital single PlaySuperkind: Apply for a Beta Test. The group originally consisted of five members: Eugene, Geon, Daemon, Suejin and Sio. Seung and JDV joined the group a few months after debut.\n\n\n== Name ==\nSuper kind is an anagram of the words \"Nuke\", \"Prid\" and \"S\". Nukes are the virtual members, Prid are the real members, and S is something \"mysterious\" that unites them. The name reflects the group's quest to find the letter S and complete the anagram.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2019–2021: Yours Project ===\nIn 2019, Deep Studio Entertainment presented their pre-debut project called Yours Project. The company, which has specialized in deepfake technology since its founding in 2017, had intended to debut a virtual idol based on the 1998 virtual singer, Adam.\nThe company began recruiting real trainees for the project, in order to find out what fans wanted and how they should interact with them, to enhance the success of their project. The project was governed by fan voting, who could select which trainees they wanted to see on fanams and talk to them through a Discord server. However, the project was canceled in 2021 after the departure of several trainees.\nIn late 2021, the company replaced Yours Project's social media with Super kind's, and revealed the virtual member of the group, Suejin, in November.\n\n\n=== 2023–present: Debut with PlaySuperkind: Apply for a Beta Test, Pasueri'd: Player Gauge 200 and Profiles of the Future (Λ): 70% ===\nSuejin's debut trailer was released in January 2022, and the remaining four members were revealed in March. The group debuted on June 20 with the digital single Pasueri'd: Apply for a Beta Test. The group was described as \"the first decentralized K-pop entertainment\" in which their fan club, called \"Players\", could decide how the group would develop and what concepts they wanted to see in their upcoming releases.\nOn July 27, 2022, JDV was announced as the new member of the group. On December 8, Seung, the second virtual member, was added to the group during the \"Chapter 2: Take Me There\" event.\nOn March 17, 2023, the group released their second digital single called Pasueri'd: Player Gauge 200.\nOn October 18, the group released their first extended play (EP) Profiles of the Future (Λ): 70% and its lead single \"Beam me up (2Dx3D)\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nEugene (유진\nGeon (건)\nDemon (대이먼)leader\nSajin (세진)\nSio (시오)\nSeung (승)\nJDV\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

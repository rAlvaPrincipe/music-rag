    "text": "Migala was a rock-based experimental band hailing from Madrid, Spain. The band was known for its complex, varied, and often cathartic musical arrangements, heavily influenced by pop, post-rock, folk, and traditional Spanish music.\nAlthough Migala have split up, giving their last concert at the Festival Internacional de Benicàssim, members of the band continue to be involved in various musical projects: Abel with El Hijo, playing with the musicians Raúl Fernández, Xavi Mole and Kieran Stephen; and Kieran Stephen records under the name of Fantasy Bar. Nacho Vegas, Manta Ray's ex-guitarist, was a member of Migala from Arde up until La Increíble Aventura, while at the same time releasing albums under his own name and with his band, Las Esferas Invisibles.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDiciembre 3 a.m. (1997, Acuarela)\nAsí duele un verano (1998, Acuarela)\nArde (2000, Acuarela)\nRestos de un incendio (2001, Acuarela)\nLa increíble Aventura (2004, Acuarela)\n\n\n== El Hijo ==\nLa Piel del Oso EP (2006, Acuarela)\nCanciones Gringas EP (2006, Acuarela)\nLas Otras Vidas LP (2007, Acuarela)\n\n\n== Fantasy Bar ==\nFriday Afternoon Car (June 2008, Acuarela)\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite of Abel Hernandez's solo project, El hijo\nMyspace of Fantasy Bar\nAcuarela Discos, home of Migala, El Hijo & Fantasy Bar, and other bands\nSub Pop Records band website"

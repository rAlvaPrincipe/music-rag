    "text": "Big Ass Truck (BAT) is an American rock band from Memphis, Tennessee which incorporates elements of hip-hop, rock, funk and psychedelia in their music. The band includes a DJ spinning records, that provides beats, loops, and samples during recordings and live performances. The group disbanded sometime after the release of the 2001 album, The Rug, but as of 2021 has been playing live shows again.\n\n\n== Lineup ==\nThe founding members of Big Ass Truck included drummer Robert Barnett, DJ Colin Butler, bassist Joe Boone, keyboardist Alex Greene, singer/guitarist Robby Grant and singer/guitarist Steve Selvidge. The line-up changed throughout the 90s, including bass players such as Lucero's/Jello 1-2-3's John C. Stubblefield, Grayson Grant and Dros Liposack, as well as keyboard player Chris Parker. At times, the band also included producer Ross Rice.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1995, Big Ass Truck released their self-titled debut album. Soon after, the group toured with 311 throughout the American South, among others. In 1996 they released the album Kent. The band also released an E.P. on Yep Roc entitled Sack Lunch. Under the name \"Big Angelic Truck\" the band recorded two Christmas songs, \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" and \"Holly Jolly Christmas\" for a local charity.  Later these songs were released as a limited edition single.\nThe band's 2000 release, Who Let You In Here?, was described by one reviewer as \"a clunky junk-shop mixture of sounds and styles\".

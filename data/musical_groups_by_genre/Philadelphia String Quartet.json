    "text": "The Philadelphia String Quartet was an American string quartet founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA in 1959-60, by four members of the Philadelphia Orchestra. They later broke off from the orchestra and accepted a residency at the University of Washington (UW).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe founding members of the Philadelphia String Quartet were all members of the Philadelphia Orchestra under the baton of Eugene Ormandy. They included Veda Reynolds, first violin, Irwin Eisenberg, second violin, Alan Iglitzin, viola, and Charles Brennand, cello. In 1961, the group was appointed quartet in residence at University of Pennsylvania. The original quartet made its New York City debut at Carnegie Hall during the 1963-64 season.\nThe foursome resigned from the orchestra to become quartet-in-residence at the University of Washington (UW) in 1966. The move angered Philadelphia Orchestra management, which sued UW to prevent the quartet's departure, claiming a contract violation. The players eventually won the right to leave the orchestra.\nIn 1966, the quartet moved to Seattle to become UW's Quartet-in-Residence, a position it held until 1982.  A fiscal crisis at the university ended their 17-year long contract.\nIn 1968, the US State Department invited the quartet to become the first American string quartet to perform in India. The two-month tour covered the entire country, with concerts played to great acclaim in 14 cities. During its 30-year tenure, the quartet repeatedly toured the world and recorded an extensive chamber music repertoire. From 1976-77, the quartet played the entire cycle of quartets by Ludwig van Beethoven, including the Quartet No. 3 in D Major, Quartet No. 9 in C Major, Quartet No. 16 in F Major, and the Grosse Fugue.  \nThey championed new music, and had a close musical relationship with the American composer, George Rochberg. They commissioned and premiered his 2nd quartet. They had a close relationship with Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera.  The Philadelphia String Quartet worked with Ginastera extensively before they performed the world premiere of his revised 2nd quartet.  \nThe founding quartet earned the Washington Governor's Arts Award. A quartet of their UW students won the Coleman Chamber Music competition prize. Their residency included relationships with Washington State University, Eastern Washington University and Central Washington University where the quartet held open rehearsals and performed with faculty members. Their LPs included works from Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Bergsma, Bercera, Chihara, and other living composers.  \n\nReynolds departure in 1975 marked the end of the quartet's original members. Violinist Stanley Ritchie filled the opening. Brennand died in 1976, replaced cellist Carter Enyeart. They performed the Beethoven Cycle at Meany Hall at UW, and continued to tour internationally.   \nFrom 1983-1987 the quartet consisted of members Karen Iglitzin, 1st violinist and Iglitzen's daughter, Eisenberg, Alan Iglitzin, and Roger Lebow, followed by Alexander Segal. They performed across the US, including many university and community residencies. The quartet also toured Brazil, Columbia, and Chile in 1983 and India in 1985. \nIn 1984, Adam Iglitzin founded the Concerts-in-the-Barnat the Olympic Music Festival. It was awarded Best Classical Music Festival by readers of Seattle Weekly. Karen Iglitzin founded the \"Chamber Music Institute\" in 1984, which operated in the summer on the farm. Many teenagers came to live and study quartets with the Philadelphia String Quartet. Alumni included many who became professional players. The Olympic Music Festival name passed to another organization, but the original barn series continued.\nThe name of the quartet was revived by violist Radhames Santos.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== 1st violinists ===\nCo-founder, Veda Reynolds, (b:1922-d: 2000) Served as 1st violinist from 1960-1975 \nStanley Ritchie, from 1975-1981\nPeter Marsh, from 1982-1983\nKaren Iglitzin, from 1983-1987\nStefan Hersh, from 1988-1992\n\n\n=== 2nd violinists ===\nCo-founder, Irwin Eisenberg (1919-2014) Served as 2nd violinist from 1960-2000 \nRoberta Hersh, from 1988-1992\n\n\n=== Violist ===\nCo-founder: Alan Iglitzin (b:1931) Served as violist from 1960-2000\n\n\n=== Cellists ===\nCo-founder, Charles Brennand (b:1929-d:1976) Served as cellist, 1960-1976 \nCarter Enyeart, 1976-1982\nRoger Lebow, 1982-1984\nAlexander Segal, 1985-1987\nJennifer Culp, 1988-1992\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Ataraxia is an Italian neoclassical dark wave band founded in 1985. Fronted by vocalist Francesca Nicoli, it combines modern technology with archaic instrumentation. Its lyrical themes are frequently drawn from nature and ancient cultures.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was founded by Francesca Nicoli and Michele Urbano in November 1985. In the first five years there were many musicians in the band, until finally Francesca Nicoli, Vittorio Vandelli, and Giovanni Pagliari became the basic line-up until today.\n\n\n== Style and lyrical themes ==\nThe band combine modern technology with archaic instrumentation over various media. The members have said they have dedicated their lives to art, to explore the nobleness of centuries in many possible ways (music, poetry, theatre, and photography). They define themselves as \"craftsmen of the sound\" because they create an unusual mix of sacred and profane, atmospheric and experimental, contemporary and early music, using acoustic and electric instruments as well, always with such language which fits best to the actual work.\nThe word ataraxia is taken from Epicurean philosophy and means \"equanimity\", \"calmness\" and \"unflappability\". Ataraxia place themselves in a spiritual tradition from Greco-Roman and Celtic cultures. Nicoli has described the production process as \"medianic\" and associated it with the cult of Dionysus, where \"the musician was possessed by the God of Nature who spoke through him/her\". Regarding the band's pagan themes, Nicoli associates the word paganism with the countryside, and maintains that life in the countryside creates a connection to the rhythm of nature. In that sense, she considers Atarax a pagan band: \"I feel that I'm in a communion with that which surrounds me\".\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nFrancesca Nicoli - vocal, flute, programming (since 1985)\nVittorio Vandelli - guitars, percussion, vocal, programming (since 1986)\nGiovanni Pagliari - keys, vocal, programming (since 1990)\n\n\n=== Past ===\nMichele Urbano - bass (1985 – 1992)\nDonato - guitar\nRiccardo Spaggiari - percussion, drums, programming (2003 - 2021)\n\n\n=== Contributors ===\nLorenzo Busi - actor and dancer (1991 – 2003)\nLivio Bedeschi - photographer and graphic designer\nNicolas Ramain - speech and guitar in the song \"Strange Lights\"\nFrancesco Banchini - clarinet, flute, percussion, vocal (1999 – 2003)\n\n\n== Releases ==\n\n\n=== Full-length Albums ===\nProphetia (1990)\nNosce te ipsum (1991)\nArazzi (1993)\nSub ignissima luna (1993)\nSimphonia sine nomine (1994)\nAd perpetuam rei memoriam (1994)\nLa malédiction d'Ondine (1995)\nThe Moon Sang on the April Chair (1995)\nIl fantasma dell'opera (1996)\nConcerto N.6: A baroque plaisanterie (1996)\nHistoriae (1998)\nLost Atlantis (1999)\nSuenos (2001)\nMon seul désir (2002)\nSaphir (2004)\nParis spleen (2006) (its cover features the main entrance of Cabaret de L'Enfer )\nKremastra nera (2007)\nLlyr (2010)\nSpasms (2013)\nWind at Mount Elo (2014)\nEna (2015)\nDeep Blue Firmament (2016)\nSynchronicity Embraced (2018)\nQuasar (2020)\nPomegranate – The Chant Of The Elementals (2022)\nCentaurea (2024)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nOs cavaleiros do templo (VHS + CD) (1998)\nStrange Lights (2005 / 2009)\n\n\n=== Others ===\nOrlando (maxi CD) (1998)\nDes paroles blanches (maxi CD) (2003)\nArcana eco (book + CD) (2005)\n\n\n=== Videos ===\nNosce te ipsum (1991)\nWould the Winged Light Climb?

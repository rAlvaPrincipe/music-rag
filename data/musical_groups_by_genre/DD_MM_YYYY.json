    "text": "DD/MM/YYYY (pronounced \"day month year\") was a Canadian experimental rock band from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. They were known for their abstract music, use of unconventional instruments, use of complex time signatures, and their rotating member roles.\nThe nature of DD/MM/YYYY's music was explained as \"a mess of spastic, specially challenged art rock with jagged, diamondback guitars, '80s video game synthesizers, and drums that roll with all the punches of the discordant dreamy vocals\" and self-described as \"always changing and always moving\"\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe band was formed from ex-members of Toronto bands Plant the Bomb, The Viking Club and The Newfound Interest in Connecticut.\nOn 17 March 2009, DD/MM/YYYY released their third and final album, Black Square. The album garnered much national, and international press for the band. The Canadian Dose Magazine gave it 4/5 stars and described the album along its enigmatic terms saying: \"Black Square bends time and space, trapping you in a dense mesh of punk noise and math rock that will stay imprinted in your neural pathways long after the album’s final coda.\" The band also embarked on two 5-week European tours and two 60-date North American tours in support of the album.\nDD/MM/YYYY toured with Crystal Castles, Don Caballero, sBACH, These Arms Are Snakes, and Japanther. They've also performed at South by South West Music Festival in Austin, Texas three times (2008, 2009, and 2010).\nIn 2010, the band traveled to Hong Kong to play at the Music Matters conference.\nThe band was chosen by Portishead to perform at the ATP I'll Be Your Mirror festivals they curated in July at London's Alexandra Palace and in September in Asbury Park, New Jersey.\nDD/MM/YYYY played their final show on 11 November 2011 at 918 Bathurst Centre in Toronto. On 17 November, four of the five members debuted their new band Absolutely Free at the M For Montreal Festival.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMike Claxton — bass guitar, synthesizers, clarinet\nTomas Del Balso — vocals, guitars, drums\nJordan Holmes — synthesizers, guitars\nMatt King — vocals, synthesizers, drums, saxophone\nMoshe Rozenberg — drums, synthesizers\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBlue Screen of Death (2005, We Are Busy Bodies)\nAre They Masks?

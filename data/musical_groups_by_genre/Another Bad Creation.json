    "text": "Another Bad Creation (sometimes called ABC for short) was an American hip hop and new jack swing group from Atlanta who were active in the early 1990s.\n\n\n== History ==\nABC consisted of David \"Li'l Dave\" Shelton (b. November 11, 1982 from Boston, Massachusetts), cousins Romelle \"RoRo\" Chapman (b. June 15, 1978 from Atlanta, Georgia) and Christopher \"Chris\" Sellers (b. October 19, 1978 from Cleveland, Ohio), and brothers from Atlanta, Georgia Demetrius \"Red\" (b. September 23, 1979) and Marliss \"Mark\" (b. April 15, 1982) Pugh, as well as Adrian \"G.A.\" (General Austin) Witcher (b. September 7, 1978). They were discovered by Michael Bivins.\nABC's debut album Coolin' at the Playground Ya Know! was released on February 11, 1991. The album's two biggest singles were the first and second singles: \"Iesha\" and \"Playground\" respectively, which reached the top ten on both the R&B and pop charts (the latter was also the group's only showing on the Dance chart). A cover of New Edition's song \"Jealous Girl\" followed, as well as the singles \"Spydermann\" and \"My World\". The album reached #7 on the Billboard 200 and eventually went platinum.\nDuring this time, Mark and Dave appeared among other children (including Macaulay Culkin) in a scene of Michael Jackson's video \"Black or White\". Also during the same time, all the members of ABC made their only movie appearance to date, as characters in The Meteor Man (which also featured appearances from various other musicians). They dyed their hair blonde for the movie, a style they also showcased in the video for the East Coast Family's only collective song, \"1-4-All-4-1\".\nOn March 3, 1991, Another Bad Creation appeared on the sketch comedy show In Living Color singing \"Iesha\". Keenen Ivory Wayans introduced them by comparing them to The Jackson 5, New Edition, and The Boys. \nABC's second album It Ain't What U Wear, It's How U Play It was released on September 21, 1993. The album and the singles did not chart on a Billboard chart.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnother Bad Creation at AllMusic\nAnother Bad Creation at Discogs\nAnother Bad Creation discography at MusicBrainz"

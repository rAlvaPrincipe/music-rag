    "text": "A Flock of Seagulls are an English new wave band formed in Liverpool in 1979. The group, whose best-known line-up comprised Mike Score, Ali Score, Frank Maudsley and Paul Reynolds, hit the peak of their chart success in the early 1980s.\nThe group had a string of international hit singles including \"I Ran (So Far Away)\" (1982), \"Space Age Love Song\" (1982), \"Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)\" (1982), and \"The More You Live, the More You Love\" (1984). Their video for \"I Ran (So Far Away)\" received airplay on MTV during the Second British Invasion. The band won a Grammy Award in 1983 for their instrumental \"D.N.A.\" (1982).\nIn 2018, the members of the original lineup assembled to record the album Ascension with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2021, the original lineup again reunited temporarily to record another album with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, String Theory.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1979–1982: Formation and debut album ===\nThe band A Flock of Seagulls was formed in Liverpool, England, in 1979 by Mike Score, Frank Maudsley and Ali Score. Mike was a hairdresser when he bought a second-hand Korg MS-10 synthesizer and invited his friends to form the band. Frank played bass and Ali drums, even without prior experience. After testing six guitarists, Willie Woo joined the band and brought in Mark Edmondson to replace Ali on drums. Later, the Score brothers had a falling out, and Mark Edmondson left. Ali returned to the band and shortly afterwards Woo left, being replaced by Paul Reynolds, a 17-year-old friend of Mark Edmondson. Initially, the band did not have a vocalist. Mike, who was the composer of the songs, sang just to show how he thought the song should sound. However, Frank suggested that he be the band's official lead singer. Mike was reluctant at first, but ended up accepting the suggestion.\nThe band began playing local clubs and eventually got a record deal with Jive Records. In 1981, they released their first single, \"Talking\", which was produced by Bill Nelson. The single was a moderate success in the United Kingdom. In 1982, the band released their second single, \"Telecommunication\", which was also produced by Bill Nelson. The single was an even bigger success than the first and became a club hit. The band's third release was the EP Modern Love is Automatic. Released in the US, it included the single \"Telecommunication\" as well as \"I Ran (So Far Away)\" — which became the band's biggest hit and was in heavy rotation on the new cable channel, MTV. The video for \"I Ran\" was low budget (even for the time), but it provided enormous exposure for the band, and it is well-remembered in part because MTV played it frequently.\nThe band's debut album, A Flock of Seagulls, was released in 1982. The album was a commercial and critical success, reaching number 1 in Australia and the Top 10 in the US and New Zealand. The album was praised for its new wave songs, which were influenced by styles such as synthpop, post-punk and new romantic. The band was also praised for their image, which was characterized by slicked-back hair and colorful clothing. The album was influential in pop music in the 1980s. The band was one of the pioneers of synthpop and helped popularize the style.\n\n\n=== 1983: Listen and the peak of popularity ===\nIn late 1982, A Flock of Seagulls finally achieved commercial success in their home country with the single \"Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)\", which reached the top 10. The song was inspired by a short romance that vocalist Mike Score had with a girl on tour in the United States. The girl had a Polaroid camera, and Score asked her to take a picture with it. She said if he had the photo, he would leave and the romance would be forgotten. They broke up soon after, and Score wrote the song about how he wished he had a photo of her to remember her by.\nThe band began 1983 at the Palladium in New York playing the MTV New Year's Eve Rock n' Roll Ball with \"Space Age Love Song\" still climbing the charts in the U.S. following the top ten success of \"I Ran\".\nListen, the follow-up to band's debut album, was released at the end of April 1983 and also received positive reviews. AllMusic critic Tom Demalon praises the single \"Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)\" as \"multilayered and hypnotic\" and also has written favorably about the songs \"Nightmares\" and \"Transfer Affection\".\nThe band continued to enjoy commercial and critical success in 1983. They performed at the US Festival (in San Bernardino, California) in May and at Holleder Memorial Stadium (in Rochester, New York) in July. They also began touring with the band The Police.\nThree more singles were released for Listen in 1983, but they were only moderately successful. The band began to lose popularity in the late 1980s, but they continue to perform and record.\n\n\n=== 1984: The Story of a Young Heart and Reynolds' departure ===\nFollowing the commercial success of their debut album, A Flock of Seagulls decided to change direction on their third album, The Story of a Young Heart. The band ventured into a new style, wanting to make a concept album based on themes such as suicide and heartbreak. The album was produced by Steve Lovell and featured more accentuated guitars and a more polished sound. The song's lyrics were written by Mike Score, who had lost a close friend to suicide. The song \"Remember David\" was written in honour of his deceased friend.\nDespite the band's efforts, The Story of a Young Heart was not as commercially successful as their debut album. The singles \"The More You Live, The More You Love\" and \"Never Again (The Dancer)\" reached the top 40 on the US and UK charts, but \"Remember David\" was not as popular and had moderate success.\nDuring the album's tour, the band's guitarist Paul Reynolds became involved with drug abuse. His drug problems worsened, resulting in his exit from the band mid-tour. The tour ended early. The band was without a guitarist. Reynolds' departure was a blow to A Flock of Seagulls. The band never again managed to achieve the same success as their early years.\n\n\n=== 1985–1986: New lineup, Dream Come True and hiatus ===\nAfter Paul Reynolds' departure, A Flock of Seagulls underwent a revamp. Gary Steadman, former Classix Nouveaux guitarist, was hired to replace Reynolds. Chris Chryssaphis, keyboardist, also joined the band. With the new lineup, the band recorded their fourth album, Dream Come True. The album was released in 1985 in the UK and in 1986 in the US.\nDream Come True was a commercial failure. Reviews were negative, with some critics calling the songs \"lifeless\" and \"ineffective\". The band dissolved in 1986 after the album's failure.\n\n\n=== 1988–1998: Various formations and The Light at the End of the World ===\nIn 1988, Mike Score formed a new band with local Philadelphia musicians. This lineup released the single \"Magic\" in 1989.\nIn 1994, Score formed a new band with Ed Berner, A.J. Mazzetti and Dean Pichette. This lineup recorded the album The Light at the End of the World, released only in the US in 1995. The album was a commercial and critical failure. Critics called it \"tedious\" and \"embarrassing\", while fans claimed it was \"misinterpreted\". Score said the album was an unsuccessful attempt to bring the band into the grunge era, which dominated popular music at the time.\n\n\n=== 1998–2018: Touring and Ascension years ===\nIn 1998, Mike Score formed a new band with Joe Rodriguez, Darryl Sons and Rob Wright. The band re-recorded Madonna's song \"This Used to Be My Playground\" in 1999 for Madonna's 2000 tribute album, The World's Greatest 80s Tribute.\n\nIn November 2003, the band's original lineup reunited for a one-off performance on the VH1 series Bands Reunited. In September 2004, they reformed again and went on a brief tour of the United States.\nIn 2013, Mike Score launched a solo career. He released the singles \"All I Wanna Do\" and \"Somebody Like You\".\n\nIn 2016, Kevin Rankin replaced Michael Brahm on drums. In December 2017, Gordon Deppe (from the Canadian band Spoons replaced Joe Rodriguez.In 2018, the band's four original members reunited to record a new album, Ascension. The album was released in July 2018 and received positive reviews. Since the album's release, Mike Score expressed a desire to reunite the original lineup for a tour.\n\n\n=== 2019—: Inflight and String Theory ===\nIn 2019, the original members of A Flock of Seagulls reunited to record a new album, Inflight (The Extended Essentials). The album was released on July 12, 2019 and featured extended versions of some of the band's biggest hits, such as \"I Ran (So Far Away)\", \"Space Age Love Song\" and \"Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)\".\nIn the same year, Mike Score revealed in an interview with Classic Pop magazine that he was working on a new solo album, Space Boy. However, the album has yet to be released.\nIn 2021, the band announced that they would release a new orchestral album, String Theory. Scheduled for release on August 20, 2021, the album features orchestral versions of some of the band's hits, such as \"Messages\", \"Remember David\" and \"Say You Love Me\". The album's first single, \"Say You Love Me\", was released on July 23, 2021. The single was released in seven different versions and featured a music video released on YouTube.\nOn August 9, 2024, the band announced their first album of new songs since The Light At The End Of The World, releasing the single titled Some Dreams. The sixth album of new songs will be released in December 2024 and will be called Some Dreams. The band's current lineup features Mike Score on vocals, Pando on bass, Gordon Deppe (The Spoons) on guitar and Kevin Rankin on drums.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nOwing to their memorable and unusual style and appearance, A Flock of Seagulls are sometimes referred to with ironic appreciation. The New Musical Express wrote: \"Of course, everyone remembers this group now for singer Mike Score's ridiculous back-combed haircut and the fact that they are mentioned in Pulp Fiction. So now they're kind of cool, but in the early 1980s it was a different story.\"\nThe band was featured on Viacom's VH1 and Sony's BMG Legacy Recordings' 2006 revival CD series and multi-platform marketing campaign, \"We Are the 80's\". In a 2007 article for The Guardian, Alfred Hickling described the group as \"dreadful\", and unfavourably compared them to new wave peers OMD and other Liverpool acts of the time.\nThe band is also noted for creating their debut album, a successful concept album which alludes to an alien invasion of earth. Billboard writer Robert Christgau applauded their \"mechanical lyrics, about a mechanical end of the world,\" while noting the \"aural pleasure\" of both the band's debut album and the follow-up.\nCryptic Rock writer Alfie Mella praised the band as the \"poster band of new wave music\" due to the flamboyant hairstyle of its members, particularly the so-described \"waterfall bangs\" of its frontman. He also noted the band's \"flanger and reverb-heavy, angular guitar strums; melodic keyboard lines and synth washes; dancey drumbeats; groove-driven bass lines; and icy, low-register vocal styling\" as defining the genre.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n=== Line-ups ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nA Flock of Seagulls (1982)\nListen (1983)\nThe Story of a Young Heart (1984)\nDream Come True (1986)\nThe Light at the End of the World (1995)\nSome Dreams (2024)\n\n\n=== Orchestral albums ===\nAscension (2018)\nString Theory (2021)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bands named after other performers' songs\nList of new wave artists\nList of Peel sessions\nList of synth-pop artists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nA Flock of Seagulls discography at Discogs \nA Flock of Seagulls at IMDb"

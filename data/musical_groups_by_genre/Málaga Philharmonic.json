Founded in 1991, the Philharmonic plays regularly at the Teatro Cervantes in Málaga. Since 2014, its principal conductor has been Manuel Hernández-Silva.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Málaga Philharmonic Orchestra (Orquesta Filarmónica de Málaga) held its inaugural concert on February 14, 1991. Initially established as the Orquesta Ciudad de Málaga (City Orchestra of Málaga), it was founded through a collaboration between the Málaga Town Council and the Regional Government of Andalusia, reflecting the belief that Málaga deserved a symphony orchestra of its own.\nThe orchestra is dedicated to providing high-quality musical performances and regularly features prominent conductors and soloists from both national and international stages. Over its history, five principal conductors have shaped its artistic direction: Octav Calleya, Odón Alonso, Alexander Rahbari, Aldo Ceccato, and Edmon Colomer.\nThe orchestra has hosted a distinguished roster of guest conductors, including Jesús López Cobos, Philippe Entremont, Juanjo Mena, Sergiu Comissiona, Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos, Antoni Ros-Marbà, Nicholas Milton, and Yoav Talmi to name but a few. The orchestra has received soloists, including Alicia de Larrocha, Plácido Domingo, Alfredo Kraus, Joaquín Achúcarro, Pinchas Zukerman, Montserrat Caballé, Ainhoa Arteta, Carlos Álvarez, Stefan Dohr, Hansjörg Schellenberger, Leonidas Kavakos, Nikolaj Znaider, Julian Rachlin,and Asier Polo.\n\nThe Málaga Philharmonic Orchestra continues to be a key cultural institution, enriching the city’s musical landscape through its performances and collaborations.\n\nThe Málaga Philharmonic Orchestra has issued several CD recordings as a part of the Festival of Ancient Music and Cycle of Contemporary Music events. They have performed at several theaters and festivals throughout Spain, as well as touring Europe, including Sweden, Greece, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Germany. \n\n\n== Principal conductors ==\nOctav Calleya (1991–1995)\nOdón Alonso (1995–1999)\nAlexander Rahbari (1999–2004)\nAldo Ceccato (2004–2009)\nEdmon Colomer (2010–2013)\nManuel Hernández-Silva (2014– )\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nTeatro Cervantes Official website"

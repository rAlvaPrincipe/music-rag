    "text": "Karlowy Vary was a Croatian and Yugoslav underground post-punk band from Zagreb active in the 1980s all over former Yugoslavia. The first name of the band was \"Korowa Bar\", and the first singer was Igor Zambelli Slojmun who was replaced with Milan Manojlović Mance, but only after Varja Orlić, dancer and performer entered the bend they got a shape. Her deep almost masculine voice and exceptional movement on the stage made the band famous in these years.\nThey planned to release three albums. The first recordings of the band, named only \"Demo 1982\", planned to be part of the compilation on which several post-punk or new wave bands (beside Korowa Bar, Sexa and Dorian Gray (band)) should be presented. \"Demo 1982\" was recorded in the year 1982 at Zagreb Radio and TV studio as a music project of famous Croatian music critic Dražen Vrdoljak. Unfortunately the band Dorian Gray (band) canceled and the whole project failed. The second album \"Haotika\" was also not released due to various reasons but the demo tapes of both albums are preserved. The third was released by PGP RTB, named La Femme. Tomo in der Muhlen  was the composer, producer and band leader. \nMembers:\n\nVarja Orlic - vocals \nIgor Zambelli Slojmun - vocals\nMilan Manojlović Mance - vocals\nTomo in der Muhlen - guitars, Arp Avatar, Roland TR808\nMargita Stefanović - keyboards, suptractive analog syntisizer (Oberheim OB-8)\nHrvoje Piletic - Pile - Guitars\nStanko Juzbašić - programer of Oberheim OB-8\nDražen Pencel Pink - bass\nZdravko Ostojić Mark - drums\nDragan Simenovski - drums\nRista Ibrić (Rista Al'Ibro) - violin\n\n\n== References =="

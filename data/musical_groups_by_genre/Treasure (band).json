Its former members, Mashiho and Bang Ye-dam, departed from the group in November 2022. Treasure debuted with the single album The First Step: Chapter One (2020)—the first in a tetralogy of albums which collectively sold over one million copies in five months.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2017–2019: Formation and pre-debut activities ===\nFollowing the establishment of YG Entertainment's representative boy bands BigBang (2006), Winner (2014), and iKon (2015), news of their next creation, circulated as early as 2017. K-pop Star 2 (2012–2013) runner-up, Bang Ye-dam, headlined reports as a member of the provisional ensemble—cited as the label's youngest male act thus far compiled of trainees aged 15–17 on average with four to five years of training; however, a survival reality program was instead planned to aid its formation. Latent candidates were seen in Stray Kids (2017), most notably Bang and K-pop Star (2011–2012) entrant, Choi Rae-sung. The label documented its creation in the series YG Treasure Box (2018–2019) and unveiled twenty-nine trainees, who were gradually eliminated as the show advanced. The finale finalized: Haruto, Bang Ye-dam, So Jung-hwan, Jun-kyu, Park Jeong-woo, Yoon Jae-hyuk, and Choi Hyun-suk, under the name, Treasure. The agency unveiled a second line-up of trainees in January 2019 inhering: Ha Yoon-bin, Mashiho, Doyoung, Yoshi, Jihoon, and Asahi under Magnum. The two were collectively to be called Treasure 13; however, Ha's departure to pursue a career as a soloist, resulted Treasure and Magnum to merge into one definite band, adopting the name, Treasure.\nSeveral attained stints in entertainment since childhood; including Junkyu, who started as a child model, Bang Ye-dam recorded for animated shows, and So Jung-hwan shortly starred as a child actor, enlisted in the Taekwondo demonstration team K-Tigers, and obtained awards with them.

Bang was first amongst the dozen to be scouted in June 2013 after the singing contest. Mashiho was accepted that year as its second recruit by an audition held by YG Japan. Junkyu, Choi and Doyoung, and Jihoon joined through private auditions gained by their respective academies in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. So, the youngest member, was cast less than a year prior to the broadcast of YG Treasure Box (2018–2019), Yoon Jae-hyuk was the only member to be street cast to audition and joined the label a few months ahead of its premiere, and its final member, Asahi joined within the same time frame.\n\n\n=== 2020–2022: Debut with The First Step tetralogy, reformation, and first Asia tour ===\n\nIn January 2020, Treasure was re-introduced to the public with pictorials and performance videos for \"Going Crazy\" (미쳐가네; michyeogane)—first disclosed on YG Treasure Box (2018–2019), and co-written by label-mate Mino of Winner—amidst others, and variety programs including Treasure Map.

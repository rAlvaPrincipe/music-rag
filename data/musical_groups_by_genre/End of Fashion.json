    "text": "End of Fashion are an Australian pop rock band from Perth, Western Australia. The group gained mainstream attention with its 2005 single \"O Yeah\", which was voted into eighth position of the Hottest 100 poll, compiled by Australian youth radio station Triple J. The group has released three studio albums. In January 2014, the band took a hiatus before reforming for their first show on 22 September 2018 at the Indian Ocean Hotel in Scarborough.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2004: Formation and first EPs ===\nThe band was formed as a side project by guitarists Justin Burford and Rodney Aravena, together with drummer Malcolm Clark and bassist Jonathon Dudman. After two years, Burford and Aravena split from The Sleepy Jackson to devote their full attention to a band they named \"End of Fashion\". After a series of bass players and drummers—including Vanessa Thornton from Jebediah, Mike Hobbs, Hugh Jennings from Autopilot, and Nicholas Jonsson—the band settled on the line-up of Hobbs as drummer and Tom King as bass guitarist. The band name also represented the band's aspirations, as Burford explained:\n\nI want to break down the walls – within that context, that image, we can do anything we want no matter whether it's super cheesy or punk, I want to kill fashion, see the end of it.\n\nIn 2003, the band started work on its first recording, the four-track EP, Rough Diamonds, with former Midnight Oil guitarist Jim Moginie as producer. The EP was jointly released through independent label Hello Cleveland! (artwork) and major label EMI.\nTriple J added both singles, \"Anything Goes\" and \"Rough Diamonds,\" to high rotation in the first week of the EP's release, and the band then performed sold-out shows during a five-week national tour in support of Little Birdy and Betchadupa. The EP was released in March 2004 and debuted at number 57 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and reached number 81 on Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2004. The band signed to EMI/Capitol Australia for overseas licensing options in early 2004, before playing SXSW.\n\n\n=== 2005–2006: End of Fashion ===\nOn 25 August 2005, End of Fashion released their self-titled debut album, which was recorded in Oxford, Mississippi, and was produced by Dennis Herring, who had previously worked with Elvis Costello, Counting Crows and Modest Mouse. The album peaked at number 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold in Australia and New Zealand, and was released in the United States in May 2006.\nThe band's first single, \"O Yeah\", reached number 21 on the ARIA Singles Chart, number 8 on Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2005, won two ARIA Music Awards and was nominated for the prestigious APRA 'Song of the Year'. The fourth single \"The Game\" debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at a career high number 13 in 2006.\nTheir songs have been on the games Thrillville (which featured \"She's Love\" and \"Lock Up Your Daughters\" on the in-game radio), ATV Offroad Fury 4 (which featured \"The Game\"), and FIFA Street 2 (which featured \"O Yeah\"). \"The Game\" was featured as the theme song for the television coverage of the 2007 NRL season on the Nine Network.\n\n\n=== 2007–2009: Book of Lies ===\nOn 15 December 2007, End of Fashion released a new song \"Biscit\" on the band's official website, Facebook and MySpace pages. End of Fashion released a further two new songs, \"Kamikaze\" and \"Walkaway\", on their MySpace page on 27 June 2008. The band's second album, titled Book of Lies, was released in September 2008. The first single released from the album was \"Fussy\", which reached number 47 in the charts.\nIn an interview with Time Out Sydney in February 2009, Burford revealed that Simon Fasolo had replaced Tom King as the band's bassist. \"He's been a really good friend of ours for years and he's been brought into the fold to take Tom's spot who we encouraged to go pursue his own project. \"\nThe second single released from the album was \"Dying for You\", a collaboration between Burford and Julian Hamilton of The Presets:\n\nThey got together at the end of 2007 and did some songwriting and \"Dying for You\" was the last song they had written. It was cool track so we bounced on it and did our thing. There were a couple of other tunes from their writing session, but \"Dying for You\" was a cut above the rest.\nThe third single \"Down or Down\" was released digitally in March 2009 and received radio coverage. During their 2009 Australian tour in support of Evermore, Burford announced that \"Force of Habit\" would be the fourth single taken from Book of Lies.\n\n\n=== 2010–2016: Holiday Trip of a Lifetime and hiatus ===\nEnd of Fashion's third studio album Holiday Trip of a Lifetime was released on 4 May 2012. The album was independently produced and released, with the band writing the album over the period of one year. \nHowever, the band members parted ways following the album's release, and Burford's focus shifted towards acting and solo music work. In January 2014 Burford identified Triple J as the primary reason for the band's demise, explaining: \"'The question becomes, when your entire fan base is tied up in a radio station and that station decides to no longer broadcast your output or even barely acknowledge your existence, where do you go from there?'\" Burford's perspective, initially published in a Facebook post, followed criticism of the radio station from other musicians and an article published by the Age newspaper, in which the journalist addressed the issue of whether Triple J has led to the \"homogenisation of Australian music\". In an interview in 2013, Burford stated that the band hadn't broken up but was in hiatus: \"We've never had the chat where we have said 'Let's call it a day'. It's just that everybody has fallen into other rhythms of life.\"\n\n\n=== 2016–present: Reunions ===\nThe band briefly reunited in 2016 before entering a second hiatus period. The shows saw Burford assemble a new line-up of the group: bassist Adam Jackson, drummer Nathan Sproule, and lead guitarist Julian Dudman. The latter was also part of The Sleepy Jackson alongside Burford, and his brother Jonathon was also a former member of End of Fashion. This same line-up made their return with a pair of hometown shows in July 2019. Later that year, the band issued their self-titled LP on vinyl for the first time ever.\nAround this time, Burford confirmed that new music was on the way. This was confirmed in August 2020, when the band released a new single entitled \"BreakThru\", and their newest single \"Ruby Lips\" a year later in August 2021.\n\n\n== Side projects ==\nBurford joined the cast of the rock musical Rock of Ages in 2010 following a meeting with producers in New York City. Burford played the lead role of Drew Boley. Rock of Ages ran from 8 April to 4 December 2011 and played in Melbourne and Brisbane. Burford was nominated for a Helpmann Award for Best Male Actor in a Musical at the 2012 Helpmann Awards.\nBurford also appeared in several episodes of the music-based game show Spicks and Specks, at the time hosted by Adam Hills for the ABC \nIn early 2012 Burford and former End of Fashion member Mike Hobbs began work crafting a one-man cabaret show that was to focus on the life and music of legendary Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. To bring the show to stage, Burford & Hobbs reunited with former bandmates Hugh Jennings and Rodney Aravena and the one time lineup of End of Fashion performed \"\"KURT\"\" at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival from 8 to 10 June 2012.\nBurford appeared with Perth Symphony Orchestra on 25 September 2013 for Vivaldi by Candlelight at the heritage listed Wesley Church in Western Australia. He later performed with Perth Symphony Orchestra at Symphony by the Lake on 8 March 2014.\nIn 2014, Aravena formed a blues duo, She Leaves the Mountain, with vocalist Dimity Magnus.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== APRA Awards ===\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), \"honouring composers and songwriters\".\n\n\n=== ARIA Music Awards ===\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music.\n\n\n=== MTV Australia Awards ===\nThe MTV Australia Awards were Australia's first awards show to celebrate both local and international acts.

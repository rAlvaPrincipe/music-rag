    "text": "The Tiptons Sax Quartet, previously known as The Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone Quartet, is a jazz saxophone quartet from Seattle, Washington.  The ensemble consists of five members (the fifth member being the quartet's drummer and percussionist).  The Tiptons are an internationally renowned saxophone quartet with drums, celebrating over 30 years as a band. Amy Denio (alto sax, clarinet, voice) is joined by co-leader Jessica Lurie (soprano/alto/tenor sax, voice), Sue Orfield (tenor sax, voice), Tina Richerson (baritone sax, voice) and Robert Kainar (drums, percussion) from Salzburg, Austria. The Tiptons' material ranges from micro-Big Band to Gospel, Bluegrass to Balkan, whimsical Chamber Jazz, and nocturnal Funk to Free Jazz Improvisation using saxophones, clarinet, their voices, drums, and inventive percussion to create a genre-busting ‘world soul’ sound. The band takes its name in honor of Billy Tipton, a 20th-century professional saxophonist and transgender man who upon his death was revealed to have been assigned female at birth.\n“… More than 30 years along, the Tiptons Saxophone Quartet and Drums are sounding better than ever. Inspired by countless memorable collaborations with musicians from around the world, this group is setting a high bar for arrangements and compositions featuring multiple horns. Their powerful, confident sound combines jazz and classical music with funk and folk music from the broad reach of humanity.”Abe Beeson, KNKX Seattle Public Radio\n“... Entrancing beats with luscious tones and harmony stacks big enough to climb.” All About Jazz\n\"The Tiptons blow up a mess of Balkan, Second Line, and carnivalesque lines, joyful, wry, and well-traveled … a hard blowing, rhythm-driven bunch of reeds.\"  The Seattle Stranger\n\n\n== Current members ==\n\nAmy Denio – alto saxophone, voice\nAmy Denio is an original member of the Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone Quartet, dating from the band's very first rehearsal at her house in the Fall of 1988.

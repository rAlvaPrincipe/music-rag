    "text": "The Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra was a group of Hollywood session musicians organized by Frank Zappa in 1967 to record music for his first solo album Lumpy Gravy.Some of these musicians are thought to have worked together in various combinations under the leadership of Ken Shroyer as far back as 1959.  However, it was Zappa who gave them the name several years later. Lumpy Gravy peaked at 159 on the Billboard 200 in 1968.\nIn 1975, Zappa organized another group using the same name which involved a few of the same musicians. This group recorded music for his album Orchestral Favorites, released in 1979.\n\n\n== Musician credits for Lumpy Gravy ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Takács Quartet is a string quartet founded in Budapest, Hungary, and now based in Boulder, Colorado, United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1975, four students at the Music Academy in Budapest, Gábor Takács-Nagy (first violin), Károly Schranz (second violin), Gábor Ormai (viola), and András Fejér (cello) formed the Takács Quartet. Takács-Nagy, Ormai and Fejér had been playing trios together for several months when they met Schranz during a pickup soccer game after classes. With his immediate addition to the group, the trio became a quartet.\nThe quartet first received international attention in 1977, winning the First Prize and the Critics' Prize at the International String Quartet Competition in Évian-les-Bains, France. After that, the quartet won the Gold Medal at the 1979 Portsmouth and Bordeaux Competitions and First Prizes at the Budapest International String Quartet Competition in 1978 and the Bratislava Competition in 1981. The quartet made its first North American tour in 1982.\nIn 1983, the group decided it would be best for them and their families if they moved to the United States. A colleague offered them a position as quartet-in-residence at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and they accepted the job.\nIn 1993, Takács-Nagy left the group, and the British violinist Edward Dusinberre replaced him. In 1994, Ormai learned that he had incurable cancer, and was replaced by another British musician, violist Roger Tapping. Following these changes, the quartet embarked on a successful series of recordings: a cycle of all six Bartók quartets (dedicated to the memory of Ormai, who died in 1995) and a critically acclaimed complete Beethoven quartet cycle, as well as quartets by Smetana and Borodin.\nIn 2005, following the completion of the Beethoven cycle, Tapping retired from the group to spend more time with his family. He now teaches chamber music at the New England Conservatory. His replacement was Geraldine Walther, an American violist who until then been principal violist of the San Francisco Symphony. The quartet's members and critics remarked on how quickly she fitted into the ensemble.\nAlso in 2005, the quartet became associate artists at the South Bank Centre. In 2006, they released their first recording with Walther, of Schubert's Rosamunde and Death and the Maiden quartets. This was also their first recording with Hyperion Records, after switching from the Decca label.\nSchranz retired from the quartet in 2018 and was replaced by University of Colorado faculty member Harumi Rhodes.\nIn 2019, violist Walther announced her retirement from the quartet. She was replaced in 2020 by American violist Richard O'Neill.\n\n\n== Current members ==\nEdward Dusinberre, first violin (since 1993)\nHarumi Rhodes, second violin (since 2018)\nRichard O'Neill, viola (since 2020)\nAndrás Fejér, cello (original member)\n\n\n== Past members ==\nGábor Takács-Nagy, first violin (1975–1993)\nGábor Ormai, viola (1975–1994)\nRoger Tapping, viola (1994–2005)\nGeraldine Walther, viola (2005–2020)\nKároly Schranz, second violin (1975–2018)\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nGrammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance: Andrew Keener (producer), Simon Dominic Eadon (engineer) and the Takács Quartet for Beethoven: String Quartets (\"Razumovsky\" Op. 59, 1–3; \"Harp\" Op. 74) (2003)\nPer The New Yorker, the quartet \"has been recording the complete Beethoven quartets, and their survey, now complete, stands as the most richly expressive modern account of this titanic cycle.\"\nThe Takács Quartet's interpretation of Bartók's six string quartets has been praised.\nThe quartet was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance for its recording of Brahms's String Quartet, Op. 51, No. 2, on the Hyperion label.\nIn 2010, the quartet was honored for Excellence in Research and Creative Work by the Boulder Faculty Assembly at the University of Colorado.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\nBartók: The Six String Quartets (Decca 289 455 297-2) (1998).

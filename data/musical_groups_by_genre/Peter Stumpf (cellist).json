He left the orchestra permanently in 2012.\nStumpf is also the cellist of the Johannes String Quartet. Musicians he has collaborated with include Emanuel Ax, Wolfgang Sawallisch, Mitsuko Uchida, and the Emerson String Quartet.\nStumpf has also taught the cello at the New England Conservatory and  USC Thornton School of Music,\n\n\n== Stolen cello ==\nOn April 27, 2004, the General Kyd, a $3.5 million Stradivarius on loan to Stumpf from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, was stolen after he left it on his porch. It was discovered in a dumpster by Melanie Stevens, a thirty-year-old nurse, after a home surveillance video from across the street showed the cello being lifted by a clumsy thief on a bicycle at around 6:30 am. Stevens initially asked her boyfriend to turn it into a CD cabinet, though a week and a half later, she caught a news report about the missing cello and the $50,000 reward for its return. She identified it on the police website and sought to return it, with the aid of a lawyer.\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Dreamcatcher (Korean: 드림캐쳐, romanized: deurimkaechyeo; formerly known as MINX; also stylized as Dream Catcher) is a South Korean girl group formed by Dreamcatcher Company. The group consists of seven members: JiU, SuA, Siyeon, Handong, Yoohyeon, Dami, and Gahyun (formerly known as Gahyeon). They made their official debut on January 13, 2017, with the single album Nightmare.\nDreamcatcher originally debuted under the name MINX with a five-member line-up of JiU, SuA, Siyeon, Yoohyeon, and Dami. In November 2016, the group announced their re-debut in 2017 under the new name Dreamcatcher, with two new members Handong and Gahyun, as well as a darker concept with a non-mainstream music style, in order to stand out from other K-pop girl groups.\nDreamcatcher has come to be known as \"The Face of Rock in K-pop\"; their music has been praised for its distinctive sound, combining elements of both rock and metal. The group has developed a stronger international popularity as compared to their domestic popularity, and a reputation for touring overseas often.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2014–2016: MINX ===\n\nUnder the name Minx, the group held their first live performance at the Oak Valley Summertime Festival on August 9, 2014, performing two original songs: \"Action\" and \"Why Did You Come To My Home\". On September 15, Happyface Entertainment officially announced their new girl group. Three days later, Minx released their debut digital single \"Why Did You Come to My Home\", making their official music show debut on M Countdown. That December, they released a holiday single, a cover of \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" with their labelmate, the girl group Dal Shabet.\nIn July 2015, Minx released their first and only EP Love Shake, with a lead single of the same name. The single was promoted as a \"joyous song\" that \"goes well with summer\", a remake of the song \"Love Shake\" from Dal Shabet's Bang Bang album.\nIn November 2016, after a year of limited activity, Happyface Entertainment revealed that Minx would re-debut under the name Dreamcatcher with two additional members, Handong and Gahyun. In a later interview, CEO Lee Joowon said that he believed Minx had failed because there were too many K-pop girl groups promoting at that time with a similar \"cute\" concept and music style. He explained that Dreamcatcher was intended to have a \"girl group style that didn't exist in Korea, a girl group concept that didn't happen very often\" and that the point of launching Dreamcatcher would be to do \"what others won't do.\"\n\n\n=== 2017: Re-debut as Dreamcatcher and start of Nightmare series ===\nOn January 13, 2017, the group re-debuted as Dreamcatcher with the release of their single album Nightmare.

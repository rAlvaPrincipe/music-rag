    "text": "The Firehouse Five Plus Two was a Dixieland jazz band, popular in the 1950s, consisting of members of the Disney animation department. Leader and trombonist Ward Kimball was inspired to form the band after spending time with members of the Disney animation and sound department and finding that they had a lot in common as jazz aficionados. The lunchtime chats escalated into a full on lunchtime jam session as Kimball, an amateur trombonist, and animator Frank Thomas, a pianist, would find they \"sounded pretty good all by ourselves.\" The band went by two names, the Huggajeedy Eight and the San Gabriel Valley Blue Blowers. The \"Firehouse\" motif came from a 1916 American LaFrance fire engine that Kimball restored for the local Horseless Carriage Club, and the \"Plus Two\" was from the fact the band had seven people.\nThe band was also formative in creating the Good Time Jazz label under fellow aficionado Lester Koenig, who managed all the band's releases from 1940's The Firehouse Five Plus Two Story, Volume 1 to 1970's Live at Earthquake McGoon's. Walt Disney was approving of the band, letting them play at the company's Christmas parties, at Disneyland, and other social functions, on the single condition that they never fully leave their jobs at the studio.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe formative members of the band, as listed in the liner notes for The Firehouse Five Plus Two Story.\n\nDanny Alguire — (Cornet), fingerprint expert formerly with L.A. police department, assistant director at Disney.

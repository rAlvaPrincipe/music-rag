    "text": "Terror Squad was an American hip hop collective that was first established in 1998. Based in the Bronx in New York City, the members of Terror Squad collectively debuted on a song in member Fat Joe's albums Jealous One's Envy and Don Cartagena. Terror Squad released its debut album, Terror Squad: The Album, in 1999, with its first major hit \"Whatcha Gon' Do\", credited mostly to Big Pun, who died of a heart attack in 2000. After Big Pun's death, his longtime partners Cuban Link and Triple Seis left the group and were subsequently replaced by Remy Martin (later known as Remy Ma) and Tony Sunshine. In 2004, their song \"Lean Back\" peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1995, the members of Terror Squad debuted as a group on Fat Joe's album Jealous One's Envy, in addition to appearing on Big Pun's Capital Punishment and Joe's Don Cartagena LP. Terror Squad, in its debut album Terror Squad: The Album, consisted of rappers Fat Joe, Big Pun, Cuban Link, Prospect, Armageddon, and Triple Seis.\nAs the group was on hiatus following Pun's death, most of its former members fell into obscurity, with Fat Joe having the most successful solo career among all the former members. The group reunited and released their second album, True Story, in 2004. It included the summer club hit \"Lean Back\", produced by Scott Storch, which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and 24 in the UK. A remix to \"Lean Back\" featured Lil Jon, Mase and Eminem was released on Fat Joe's 2005 album All or Nothing. Although the album failed to spawn other hit singles, Fat Joe and Remy, who contributed the vocals to \"Lean Back\", went on to release high-selling solo albums in 2006.\nTerror Squad signed to Koch Records that next year. Apart from the three new members, DJ Khaled and Cool & Dre are retained as regular crew along with Tony Sunshine.\n\n\n== Line-up ==\nFat Joe (Joseph Cartagena)\nBig Pun (Christopher Rios) (deceased)\nTony Sunshine (Antonio Cruz)\nCuban Link (Felix Delgado)\nArmageddon (John Eaddy)\nProspect (Richard Perez)\nTriple Seis (Sammy Garcia)\nRemy Ma (Reminisce Mackie)\nDJ Khaled (Khaled Mohamed Khaled)\nCool & Dre (Marcello \"Cool\" Valenzano and Andre \"Dre\" Lyon)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

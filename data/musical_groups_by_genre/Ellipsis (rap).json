    "text": "Ellipsis (Russian: Многото́чие) is a Russian hip hop group from Moscow. They perform in the styles of gangsta rap, psychedelic rap, and political rap with elements of Russian chanson and rock. Rustam Alyautdinov aka Rustaveli is the unofficial leader of the band and author of its lyrics.\nIn 1999, Mnogotochie performed at Rap Music 1999, but did not win any prizes. The next year they won the prize at the Micro 2000 fest (Микро 2000) – the same festival where MC L.E. won at the freestyle battle. At the fest Adidas Streetball Challenge 2001, the band won the third place.\nThe band has released three albums under the \"Mnogotochie\" name.\nIn 2006, the band announced their split and later continued performing under two names, DotsFam and Mnogotochie Band (Многоточие Band). While other members of the band frequently changed, Rustaveli remained its only constant member.\n\n\n== Membership ==\nThe group's membership is listed according to the official website as of April 2018.\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nKuzmitch (КузьмитчЪ) (MC 1.8; DJ Navvy; Ilya Kuznetsov) — arrangements, lyrics, mc'ing, back vocals, ideas;\nDJ Hassan – arrangements, scratches, remixes (1998—2002);\nKing-Kong (Кинг-Конг) (Alexy Piskachev) — rapping ( tracks Heads (Бошки), Who didn't use a chiva (Кто не бахался), Wet place (Мокрое место), Turn (Поворот)) (dead 4 January 2006);\nGrek (Грек) (Anatoly Grechihin) (dead 22 February 2006);\nTyuha (Тюха) (Andrey Trynov) — arrangements, guitars, design, vocal, lyrics, mc'ing;\nGena Grom(Гена Гром) — lyrics, mc'ing, back vocals, ideas;\nL.BeeAtch aka Byacha (Бьяча) — lyrics, mc'ing, back vocals;\nDimon (Димон) (Dmitry Korablin) — arrangements, lyrics, mc'ing;\nGnom (Гном);\nMihail Krasnoderevshik.\n\n\n== Style ==\nSince the formation of the collective, its members have decided to adhere to strict rules of the chosen line of behavior in creativity and in its implementation. Any attempts to use the name of the collective for dishonest earnings were denied. The organizers of the group's performances were required to prevent photos and videos that were not approved by the band. If this condition was not met, the concert was stopped and the blame for the failure of the concert fell on the organizers. However, this faded into the background over time, as every second viewer had a phone with a photo and video camera with them. During the entire period of creativity, the group did not shoot a single video clip. \nThere was a specific dress style of members – leather jacket, trousers, black shoes. This style was picked before the black color features of the listener to fully comprehend of lyrics more than colorful clothes distracting of poetry.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Band formation ===\nMnogotochie began to form in Moscow in 1997 when Rustaveli, who wrote lyrics, and DJ Hassan, who made electronic music, became acquainted. Later to him joined schoolmate of Rustaveli Grel as bass guitarist and Kuzmitch as second MC. Next joined guitarist Tyuha. Also joined closest friends of Rustaveli King-Kong and MC L.E.\n\nThe date of appearance of the band is considered to be 15 November 1998. This day was made first studio session. The name \"Mnogotochie\" emphasizes the understatement that sounds in many of their songs, the constant search for new ways of life.Ellipsis this is a thing opens the doors to your mind and what door you to enter is a personal choice each of us...Secondly, the ellipsis is what remains after death.\n\n\n=== First albums(1998—2002) ===\nOver time in the band appeared new members – L.BeeAtch, MC L.E., Gena Grom and Dimon. Most of them were about 20 years old at the time. The debut occurred on the festival Rap Music 99 where they performed the song Heads (Бошки). Шт 2000 year at the Fest Micro 2000 (Микро 2000) new member MC L.E. joined the band. The grand Prix of this fest was taken. Next year at the Adidas StreetBall Challenge 2001 was performed the song It happens in life (В жизни так бывает) which soon got into the rotation of some radio stations and became a popular hit. This song was released on the compilation «Street voice-2»(«Голос улиц 2»). But since 2001 Mnogotochie refused to this song and stopped performing it at their performances. Rustaveli commented about it:\n\nI came up with this song in 1998 and rolled his verse and chorus soulfully. It is about real events. But the unhealthy hype that it caused, back in 2001, made it clear to me that it should be excluded from the repertoire. There was too much to say, and it didn't fit with the song.\nIn 2001 year at the label «KvadroDisc» («КвадроДиск») was released debut album «Life and freedom» («Жизнь и Свобода»). Musical critics (Billboard Russia, Timeout Moscow, rap.ru) recognized this album one of the best Russian rap albums.\nBefore 2002 year a band had a producer – Vladimir Ferapontov. The first album didn't make a profit for the band. They were forced to give up the rights to distribute the album for six years. This year was released the second album «Atoms of brain»(«Атомы сознаниЯ») with a track «My heart aches with longing»(«Щемит в душе тоска») became well-known hit. At 2002 year members of Mnogotochie founded record label «Dots Family Records» where released next albums of Mnogotochie and bands, mc's affiliated with it. Also there released hip-hop compilations with different young and well-known hip-hop musicians «Hip-hop kvartal»(«Хип-хоп квартал») и «Rap Experiences»(«Рэп-Опыты»).\n\n\n=== «Third Way»(«Третий Путь») (2003—2005) ===\n«Third Way» is co-project of Mnogotochie with «M.Squad» band from Mitino Moscow district. In 2003 was released LP «Piece Of Life (Five Years Is Equal To...)» («Кусок Жизни (Пяти Годам Равен...)») . As the booklet of LP talks, «Third Way» — is:\n\nThe creative path of development, when a person chooses his own path and lives at the limit of the impossible. Sometimes it seems that he knows exactly when and how to act (\"he leads\" — they say about such people). A person is aware of himself and his place in the world — \"knows what he is doing\", he records his thoughts and actions.\nтворческий путь развития, когда человек выбирает себе дорогу и живёт на пределе невозможного. Иногда создается впечатление, что он точно знает, когда и как следует поступить («его ведёт» — говорят о таких людях). Человек осознает себя и своё место в мире — «ведает, что творит», он фиксирует свои мысли и действия.\nThis year at fifth anniversary of band was released compilation «Nenomernoy» («Неномерной») consisting of seven remixes from related musicians and six new tracks. According to the interview of Rustaveli this album is not fully functional it lives up to its name – not numbered, it is not third LP of band. \nIn 2004 was released «Que 12» («Буриме 12») – the second LP of «Third Way» featuring MC L.E, «Krasnoe Derevо» and band S.S.A.(«Смена Мнений») from Voronezh. In October 2004 was released maxi-single of MC L.E. «In spite of all» consists of 10 tracks (5 remixes) including intro and freestyle. Music was produced by Kuzmitch, Dimon and Kapus.\nIn early 2005 after seven years of work was released LP «Distances»(«Расстояния») of band «Okna»(«Окна»). It's a project of guitarist Tyuha and female vocalists Farochka in folk-rock style with trip-hop elements including poetry of Marina Tsvetaeva.\n\n\n=== Disintegration (2006) ===\nIn May 2006 was released solo album of MC L.E. — «Illegal» supported by Rustaveli, Mihail Krasnoderevshik, Kapus, S.S.A., «Fleur» produced by Kuzmitch and «Fat Complex». Was made a video for track «Someday» featuring S.S.A. («Смена Мнений»). After release returns to the motherland and begin to Russian-language rap in Georgia under the name Illegal.\nIn December 2006 there were rumors about termination of existence of Mnogotochie. Disintegration was confirmed with an interview of Rustaveli at the official website. Причины, по которым группа свернула свою деятельность, так и остались нераскрытыми. Было лишь заявлено, что КузьмитчЪ ушёл по собственному желанию (позже станет известно что он теперь — DJ Navvy, MC 1.8).\n\nI'm tired of being the same person I was this times. And it's not even in the role, but rather in myself. To go astray from the right path, it is enough to make a few small mistakes, which entail a whole bunch of large and very unworthy ones. I don't care about the role. You can do anything at all – to rap or turn the nuts, the main thing is to remain a Human.\nGena Grom chose to pursue law, interrupting his musical career. MC L.E had to stay in Georgia due to another aggravation of Russian-Georgian relations. Lubov (L.BeeAtch) chose to devote himself to family and 2010 she gave birth to a son. She continues to communicate with other past and current members. Besides that in 2006 two of members passed away – King-Kong (one of the founders of the Band and close friend of Rustaveli) and Grek.\nIn March 2007 was released third numbered album of «Mnogotochie» — «About the endless of Time»(«За бесконечность Времени»). In fact it was solo work of Rustaveli without any team.\n\nMnogotochie as Mnogotochie purely terminates his way by this album. And I think it was a worthy path. And I don't regret anything.\nWith the departure of Gena Grom as CEO and Kuzmitch as second co-founder label «Dots Family Records» ceased to exist as an LLC. It turns into an independent, unregistered and functioning only for internal projects label.\n\n\n=== Activity under new names ===\n\n\n==== DotsFam ====\nDotsFam (Dots Family) — attempt to restore the band after the breakup by Rustaveli, Dimon, Nelegal (aka MC L.E.) and Mihail Krasnoderevshik. In 2005 beatmaker Dimon makes side project Fat Complex with Anya Rodicheva and Sasha Dzjem Holenko – mix of hard electronic beat with retro samples, live vocals and rapping. Under the patronage of DotsFam new bands arose — «3 Exclamation Marks»(«3 Восклицательных Знака») and «Pili Grims» («Пили Гриммы»). This collectives was included into the first album of DotsFam — Fuckt # 1.\n15 September 2009 was released album Zombusiness, was recorded for two years since 2007 year with a break in 2008 because Nelegal came to Georgia during the conflict in South Ossetia. It was planned to shoot a video clip for track «The sin and...» («Грех и...»).\nMihail Krasnoderevshik and Tyuha start to create studio 31records and label «Kidok Production» («Кидок Production») where was recorded album «К.И.Д.О.К.» of his band «Krasnoe Derevo» («Красное Дерево»). Dimon lost the hip-hop and start his own experiments in music. Gnom released solo LP at November 2010 featuring DJ Navvy, Dimon and others members of DotsFam.\nIn June 2011 was released album «Mirrors» («Зеркала») includes some tracks of Rustaveli and Gnom featuring Shiza(ex-«Siberian sindicate»), Dinice, Marein, Sanches and others. Was shot a video for track «Autumn»(«Осенний») by Mihail Borodin. The shooting took place in Khovrin Hospital. Track «Kukushka» («Кукушка») – cover of Kino band was released at tribute compilation ( «Kinoproby. Rap-tribute».) «КИНОпробы. Рэп-трибьют».\nAfter releasing of «Mirrors» Dimon and Gnom lost DotsFam and joined to M.Squad. Alongside Gnom make his solo album.\nIn 2019 Rustaveli announced plans about new album of DotsFam featuring Nelegal, Sanches and White Hot Ice.\n\n\n==== «Mnogotochie Band» ====\n«Mnogotochie Band» (DotsBand) — live instrumental band performing classical tracks of Mnogotochie and new tracks of DotsBand, in style called art-rap.\n21 December 2011 was released single «Running away from yourself» («Бег от себя»); at the same time, the band is recording their first album.\n29 March 2018 was released second LP «Requiem for reality» («Реквием по реальности»). LP consists of melodic ballads with strong vocal and hard rap manifests.\nSince end of 2019 Sanches stopped appearing at the band's concerts; according to Rustaveli reason of it is alcoholism ща Sanches. In September 2020 Rustaveli stopped DotsBand project and plans to resume the activity in 2021 year.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThis section does not list solo albums by Rustaveli and other members of the band.\n\n\n== Critique ==\n\n23 September 2002 website VashDosug.ru:\n\n«Mnogotochie» – poets of stone jungle, poets of the stone jungle who are better not to meet in dark alleys. Band was formed in 1998 and began to play mix of Russian chanson with rap. She is concerned about poverty, drug addiction and other social problems. «Teleinform TV»  concerned by the same things, but the guys have their own view of the problem. And don't let them tell us the Kasta from Rostov-on-Don is a voice of the streets. We have a very hardcore underground\n8 April 2007 Ruslan Munnibaev from Rap.ru, having been to the last concert of band wrote a review:\n\nThere is no anything promo materials, no anything qualitative photos, not to mention any videos or merch. But all concert halls are full in whole Russia. They deliberately refused to perform their main hit at concerts. Their banal, almost vulgar texts with their concentrated power grind this very banality and vulgarity into folk poetry. It's stupid thing to say about his mc's skills before to mc for their music is like make faces when talking about serious things.\nIn May 2007 year Sergey «Sir G» Kurbanov («Банги Хэп» band) in article — «Without compromise» («Без компромиссов»):\n\nЖёстко отстаиваемое независимое мнение, идеи и принципы в творчестве — с одной стороны и абсолютное нежелание «раскрутиться», стать частью системы «шоу-бизнеса» — с другой. Группа «Многоточие» стали одними из немногих, кому удалось создать «культовый» статус андеграунд-исполнителей и в то же время настолько обширно распространить результаты своего творчества на территорию России и СНГ, что этот самый статус стал некоторыми лицами подвергаться сомнению.\n24 October 2007 «Soviet youth» newspaper:\n\n«Mnogotochie» gained the status of «cult», underground rappers in spite of deliberately rejecting anything promo. «Mnogotochie» in principle, it did not recognize any other ways to popularize the team, except through creativity.\nRussian «Billboard» 2007:\n\nThere is no second similar band in Russian hip-hop. Members of Mnogotochie during all its carrier made all in spite of all. They initially stood in opposition to the \"system\", and, nevertheless, succeeded. They avoided all contact with the media, but in spite of this, they gained a large and loyal audience.  Not a single video was made, but albums and ringtones were sold to the envy of many.\n\n3 January 2008 «Moscow Komsomolets SPB»:\n\n«Mnogotochie» haven't played much on the radio since it refused to perform main hit «It happens in life». They are not invited to corporate events because Rustaveli «doesn't want to be dessert».\n«Mnogotochie» — rare guests on TV. They prefer to turn a blind eye to Rustaveli's poems about death, graves and prison. It doesn't interfere for soloist to give out the next large portion of «black» street rap collecting sold outs in clubs of both capitals.\n\n\n== Soundtracks ==\n2005 — «Dust»(«Пыль»)\n2006 — « Khottabych »\n\n\n== Interesting facts ==\nTyuha met Mnogotochie in 1998 in a studio where he came to record his first tracks. A friend of Tyuha worked with them and removed all beats (it according to the musician was more important than the same album) by mistake. Tyuha restored them in two nights.\nBefore the Mnogotochie Gena Grom was a member of the band «Berega» with a Frol and Tug. The band had one unreleased LP.\nIn 2001, «Molotok» magazine published an article about Mnogotochie illustrated it by mistake photo of «Rtut band».\nDuring the concerts in 2003 in Ukraine during the autograph session, almost all the discs that were given for signature were unlicensed.\nin 2007, the state service for control over traffic drugs of Penza town banned from distribution tracks of Mnogotochie band due to the presence of drug promotion in the lyrics.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMnogotochie official website\n«DotsBand» on Twitter\nYouTube channel\nprofile on the Rap.Ru\n\"INSIDE SHOW – РУСТАВЕЛИ – МНОГОТОЧИЕ.

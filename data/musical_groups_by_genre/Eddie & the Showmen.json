    "text": "Eddie & the Showmen were an American surf rock band of the 1960s. Formed in Southern California by Eddie Bertrand, formerly of The Bel-Airs, they released several singles on Liberty Records.  Their highest-charting single in Los Angeles was \"Mr. Rebel\", which reached number four on the Wallichs Music City Hit List on February 10, 1964.\nThe band originally formed because Bertrand wanted to move on from the Bel-Airs. While the Bel-Airs focused more on guitar interplay, and a moderate sound, Eddie & the Showmen played more in the style of Dick Dale with a prominent lead guitar and heavy sound.  The band's original drummer was former Mouseketeer Dick Dodd, who later joined The Standells.  One of the guitar players, Larry Carlton, later became a famous jazz guitarist, and another was Rob Edwards of Colours who was the guitarist on the title track for the surf movie, Pacific Vibrations.\nOne of Eddie & the Showmen's biggest hits, \"Squad Car\", was written by Paul Johnson of the Bel-Airs. \nEddie and the Showmen are included in the Hard Rock Cafe: Surf 1998 compilation of surf bands and surf music on track 11. Mr. Rebel.  They are also included in The Birth of Surf compilation track 20 Squad Car  and are on 10 tracks of Toes on the Nose: 32 Surf Age Instrumentals compilation.\nEddie Bertrand died of cancer in November 2012.\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\"Toes on the Nose\" b/w \"Border Town\" (Liberty 55566, 1963)\n\"Squad Car\" b/w \"Scratch\" (Liberty 55608, 1963)\n\"Mr. Rebel\" b/w \"Movin'\" (Liberty 55659, 1963)\n\"Lanky Bones\" b/w \"Far Away Places\" (Liberty 55695, 1964)\n\"We Are the Young\" b/w \"Young and Lonely\" (Liberty 55720, 1964)\n\n\n== Albums ==\nSquad Car (complete singles collection plus 7 bonus tracks) (AVI Records CD-5021/EMI-Capitol Special Markets 72438-18886-29, 1996)\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nEddie Bertrand - Composer, Executive Producer, Guitar Producer\nRob Edwards - Guitar (Rhythm)\nBrett Brady - Guitar (Rhythm)\nLarry Carlton - Guitar (Rhythm)\nJohn Anderson - Guitar (Rhythm)\nFreddy Buxton - Bass\nDoug Henson - Bass\nDick Dodd - Drums\nMichael Mills - Drums\nBobby Knight - Saxophone\nSterling Storm - Saxophone\nPhillip Pruden - Saxophone\nNokie Edwards - Composer\nR.

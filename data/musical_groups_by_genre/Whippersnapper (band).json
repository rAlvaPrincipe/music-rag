    "text": "Whippersnapper was an English folk band formed in 1984, consisting of Dave Swarbrick (fiddle, mandolin, vocals), Chris Leslie (fiddle, mandolin, vocals), Kevin Dempsey (guitar, vocals) and Martin Jenkins (mando-cello, flute, vocals).\nSwarbrick left the group in 1989, and the band continued as a trio until 1993, with the only album recorded that line-up being Stories. During that time, Dempsey and Leslie released an album called Always With You as a duo. The band split when Jenkins left the group in 1993.  However, they did tour briefly again in 1994.\nFollowing Swarbrick's recovery from illness, Whippersnapper toured again as a full four piece in both 2008 and 2009.\nMartin Jenkins (born 17 July 1946, London, England) died on 17 May 2011, in Sofia, Bulgaria, from a heart attack.\nThey are not to be confused with the Australian indie rock group, The Whipper Snappers, who coincidentally played during the period 1988 to 1993.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nPromises (1985)\nTsubo (1987)\nThese Foolish Strings (1988)\nFortune (1990)\nStories (1991)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Dear Eloise (Chinese: 亲爱的艾洛伊丝; pinyin: Qīn'ài de ài luò yī sī) is a Chinese rock band composed of vocalist/producer Yang Haisong (杨海崧) and Sun Xia (孙霞).\nFormed in Beijing in 2008, the pair are known for their lo-fi DIY recordings that combine elements of shoegaze, indie pop, noise rock and experimental music. In addition to playing all of the instruments themselves, the husband-wife duo record and edit all of the band's music in their home studio.\nWhile they do not perform live and have released their recordings inconspicuously through the Beijing-based vinyl label Genjing Records and CD label Maybe Mars, the duo has managed to gain a loyal following in both the Chinese independent music scene and with critics abroad.\nTheir seventh effort, Vanishing Winter, was released on April 6, 2013 on Genjing Records. An eighth release, a split with Australian alternative rock outfit Underground Lovers, was released in August 2013 with cooperation from the Melbourne-based record label Rubber Records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Words That Were Burnt (Maybe Mars, 2010)\n美丽陌生人 (Beauty In Strangers) (Maybe Mars, 2011)\nFarewell To The Summer (Maybe Mars, 2014)\nUncontrollable, Ice Age Stories (Maybe Mars, 2016)\nThey Slipped Away From My Mind Just Like This (Maybe Mars, 2019)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n城堡 (Castle)/如果它是美丽的 (If It's Beautiful) (Genjing, 2010)\nSong For Her/Song For Him (Genjing, 2011)\nI'll Be Your Mirror (Genjing/Bubutz, 2012)\nMan Without A Name / Haunted (Acedia) (Genjing/Rubber 2013) (Split single with Underground Lovers)\nVanishing Winter/The Place In White Light (Genjing, 2013)\nDive / Summer Begins II (Maybe Mars, 2019) (Split with Lonely Leary)\n\n\n== References =="

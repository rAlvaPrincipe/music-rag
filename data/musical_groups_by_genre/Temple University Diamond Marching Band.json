It performs at all home Temple Owls football games and select away games. Other ensembles come from the main band, performing at many events during the Fall semester as well as performing at Temple Owls men's basketball and Temple Owls women's basketball games during the Spring semester.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Temple University Diamond Marching Band was started in 1925 by Herbert E. McMahan, under the direction of Charles Golder. George Otto Frey assumed the director position in 1926 and H. Edward Pike became the band's first full-time director the following year. Under Pike's direction, the band started forming the Temple \"T\" on the field, a tradition that is still present today. In 1935, the band performed at the first  Sugar Bowl. Under the direction of Dr. John H. Jenny, who replaced Pike in 1946, the band was renamed the Diamond Band.

The position is currently held by Dr. Matthew Brunner alongside the Director of Bands, Dr. Patricia Cornett.\n\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nThe Temple University Diamond Marching Band has appeared in many films over the years, most famously their part in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film).

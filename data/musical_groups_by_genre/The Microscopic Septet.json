    "text": "The Microscopic Septet is a jazz septet, founded in 1980 by saxophonist Phillip Johnston. They played frequently in New York City, toured, and recorded until they disbanded in 1992. Known affectionately as \"The Micros\" Heather Phares of Allmusic described them as \"one of the most distinctive jazz ensembles in New York during the '80s and early '90s\" due to their innovative updating of classic big band styles of the 1930s and '40s.\nThe band reformed for a few performances in 2006 in conjunction with the reissue of their first four albums, then long out of print, by Cuneiform Records. They performed again in the United States and Europe in December 2007, and have reunited for performances in New York City almost every year since, most recently at The Kitchen in Manhattan (12/9/17). Since reforming The Microscopic Septet have released four albums all on Cuneiform, most recently Been Up So Long It Looks Like Down To Me: The Micros Play The Blues.\nThey are known for performing the theme song for NPR's Fresh Air program, which was composed by pianist Joel Forrester.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\nTake the Z Train (1983) Press Records\nLet's Flip!

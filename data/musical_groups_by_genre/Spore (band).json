    "text": "Spore was a noise rock band from Boston, Massachusetts formed in the wake of the early 1990s grunge movement. Spore were signed in 1993 on the Taang! Records label, the same label which initially signed The Lemonheads, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Mission of Burma, with whom the band released a 7 inch EP.\nLead singer Mona Elliot's voice has been described as channelling \"anger and determination with a style heavily influenced by early Throwing Muses-era Kristin Hersh.\" The Spore song Fun, from the group's third album was included in the Natural Born Killers film, though it was not released on the official film soundtrack CD. The band was also known for sporting an image of André the Giant on their disc covers, with the image being similar to Shepard Fairey's well known pop art interpretation, Andre the Giant Has a Posse.\nElliot went on to form another well-regarded Boston-based band, Victory at Sea, in 1996. Ayal Naor started up the avant-garde band 27 with members of the Boston band Dirt Merchants, while also contributing on fellow Boston band Isis' critically acclaimed album Oceanic as well as touring with the band.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nMona Elliott (vocals, guitar, bass)\nAyal Naor (vocals, bass, guitar)\nMarc Orleans (guitars, vocals)\nChristian Negrette (drums, vocals)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== LPs ===\nSpore (1993 - Taang!

    "text": "Lymbyc Systym is an American instrumental band from Tempe, Arizona, which formed in 2001, consisting of the brothers Jared and Michael Bell. The band's sound combines elements of instrumental rock and electronic music. Lymbyc Systym has toured with Broken Social Scene, the Books, Crystal Castles, the Album Leaf,  Her Space Holiday, Buckethead, This Will Destroy You, Foxing and the One AM Radio. The duo have released records with Mush Records, Magic Bullet Records, Hobbledehoy Record Co, Western Vinyl and & Records (Japan). Michael Bell died on November 10, 2016, under undisclosed circumstances, leaving the future of Lymbyc Systym uncertain.\n\n\n== Background ==\nJared Bell says the intentional misspelling of the Limbic System was to own it, lamenting comparisons to Lynyrd Skynyrd. For much of the recording of the 2012 album, Symbolyst, the brothers were not in the same state. \"Our first full length when we lived in the same house in south Scottsdale, we were treating it like a job and we literally worked on it every day until it was done,\" Michael Bell explained. \"After that, it morphed into a process of exchanging ideas online... Even when we lived in New York, we never met up until the end. We worked on stuff separately and exchanged ideas [online].\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nLove Your Abuser (2007)\nShutter Release (2009)\nSymbolyst (2012)\nSplit Stones (2015)\nEPs\n\nLive Kin (2003)\nCarved by Glaciers (2005)\nField Studies (2009) - split EP with This Will Destroy You\nNew Varieties (2016)\nCompilations and remixes\n\n\"Bubonic Tonic\" (Lotus remix) on Copy/Paste/Repeat (2007)\n\"Truth Skull\" (live radio performance) on WUAG Presents: Wooden Anniversary (2008)\nLove Your Abuser Remixed (2008)\n\"What Time Is It Now\" (The Consulate General remix) on What Time Is It Now EP (2010)\n\"The Architekt\" (Arms and Sleepers remix) on Matador Remixed (2010)\nRemixes & Miscellaneous (2013)\nXPLAYMIX 21 | 2015 (2015)\n\"Paraboloid\" (Evenings remix) (2016)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWestern Vinyl Artist Page\nMush Records Artist Page\nTouring History - Pitchfork, Pitchfork, CMJ, Spin.com\nSEEN: Download Lymbyc Systym\nInterview with Lymbyc Systym"

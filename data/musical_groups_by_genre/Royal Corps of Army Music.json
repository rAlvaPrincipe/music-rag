    "text": "The Royal Corps of Army Music (RCAM, widely known by its former acronym CAMUS) is a Corps of the British Army dedicated to the provision and promotion of military music.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe formation of the Corps of Army Music was triggered by a defence review known as Options for Change in 1991 and followed a 1993 announcement by the Chief of the General Staff that the number of regular army bands was to be reduced from 69 to 30. The period saw the number of personnel fall from 2,000 to 1,100, with Lieutenant Colonel Roger Tomlinson of the Royal Military School of Music describing it as \"a gloomy time for those of us in the military music business\". The Queen signed a warrant on 13 August 1994 to allow the formation of the Corps of Army Music. All regular army officers who were Directors of Music in the various corps and regiments and all regular army musicians would transfer to the Corps of Army Music - now the newest and most junior corps in the army - on 1 September 1994.\nThe home of the corps was established at Kneller Hall in Twickenham, a site that already encompassed the Royal Military School of Music. The school was founded by the Duke of Cambridge, soon after his appointment as Commander in Chief in 1857, when the first class of military musicians was formed, a 'Class of Music'. The establishment was retitled as The Royal Military School of Music by Queen Victoria in 1887.\nThe Future Army Structure review of 2004 saw the bands of the Regular Army reduced from 30 to 23. In 2019 the number of Regular Army bands was further reduced to 14.\n\n\n=== 2019 restructuring ===\nIn 2019, the Corps of Army Music was restructured with a number of bands being co-located and re-named. In a process of 'Military Music Optimization', the regular Army band laydown was adjusted to enable several smaller bands to train and perform as larger bands for more significant Army events: 'Co-locating 11 of the smaller bands in three major garrisons and Sandhurst has increased the flexibility of CAMUS to perform at a huge breadth of events without compromising any of the traditional bands that have been performing for many years'.\n\n\n=== Renaming and move ===\nDuring a visit to Kneller Hall in December 2020, the Earl and Countess of Wessex announced the Corps of Army Music would be renamed the Royal Corps of Army Music from January 2021. This change was formally marked with a new title presentation in January 2021 with the Countess in attendance.\nIn September 2021, the Corps Headquarters moved to Gibraltar Barracks in Minley, whilst the Royal Military School of Music moved to HMS Nelson alongside the Royal Marines School of Music.\n\n\n== Bands of the Corps ==\nThe 14 constituent bands of the Corps are as follows:\n\nBand of the Household Cavalry, at Combermere Barracks, Windsor\nBand of the Grenadier Guards, at Wellington Barracks, Westminster, London\nBand of the Coldstream Guards, at Wellington Barracks, Westminster, London\nBand of the Scots Guards, at Wellington Barracks, Westminster, London\nBand of the Irish Guards, at Wellington Barracks, Westminster, London\nBand of the Welsh Guards, at Wellington Barracks, Westminster, London\nBand of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, at Dreghorn Barracks, Edinburgh\nBand and Bugles of The Rifles, at Worthy Down Barracks, Winchester\nCountess of Wessex's String Orchestra, at Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich Station, London\nBritish Army Band Catterick, at Piave Lines, Catterick Garrison\nBand of the Royal Armoured Corps\nBand of the King's Division\nBand of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers\nBritish Army Band Tidworth, at Lucknow Barracks, Tidworth Camp\nRoyal Artillery Band\nBand of the Royal Engineers\nBand of the Adjutant General's Corps\nBritish Army Band Sandhurst, at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Camberley\nBand of the Royal Corps of Signals\nBand of the Royal Logistic Corps\nBritish Army Band Colchester, at Merville Barracks, Colchester Garrison\nBand of the Queen's Division (originally disbanded in 2018)\nBand of the Parachute Regiment\nBand of the Army Air Corps\nBand of the Prince of Wales, at Brecon\nIn addition to providing personnel for all the above bands, the Corps of Army Music provides 'technical support' for the Band of the Brigade of Gurkhas, based at Shorncliffe Camp, Folkestone, which is separately constituted. Other bands may be formed from time to time by drawing together personnel from different ensembles; for example the British Army Brass Band (founded by two Army Bandmasters in 2007) is 'made up of players across all bands of the Army, Regulars and Reservists'.\n\n\n== Army Reserve bands ==\nAll Army Reserve bands are not part of RCAM, reporting to their respective regimental/battalion headquarters, and provide around 30% of all the Army's musical output.  The current Army Reserve bands, as of April 2021, are as follows:\n\nBand of the Honourable Artillery Company\nThe Band of The Royal Yeomanry (Inns of Court & City Yeomanry)\nLancashire Artillery Volunteers Band\nThe Nottinghamshire Band of the Royal Engineers\nThe (Northern) Band of the Royal Corps of Signals\nLowland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland\nHighland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland\nBand of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)\nBand of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers\nBand of the Royal Anglian Regiment\nVolunteer Band of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment\nBand of The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)\nBand of the Royal Welsh\nBand of the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border)\nBand of the Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)\nThe Band of The Mercian Regiment\nThe Salamanca Band of The Rifles\nThe Waterloo Band of The Rifles\nBand of 150th (Yorkshire) Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps\nBand of the Royal Army Medical Service\n\n\n=== Army Volunteer bands ===\nAll Army Volunteer Bands serve in a voluntary capacity and have no army reserves commitment but still perform for various mess functions, church parades and civic functions, supporting their regiment and the wider regimental family. The uniform worn is that of the regular regiment which is headquartered in the Tower of London.\n\nThe Band and Drum Corps of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (Lancashire)\nThe Band of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (Warwickshire)\n\n\n== Order of precedence ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (5th, 6th, 7th, 20th): The Regimental Handbook, Customs and Practices of The Regiment (PDF) (8th ed.).

    "text": "Cloudkicker is an American post-rock/post-metal musical project based in Columbus, Ohio, created by guitarist Ben Sharp. Sharp, a commercial airline pilot, does not pursue Cloudkicker as a full-time project; he releases his music as \"pay what you want\" under the Creative Commons license through Bandcamp.\nSharp composes, records and engineers all his music by himself; while he originally intended a studio-only project due to his distaste for touring, Sharp performed a short tour in 2014 with Intronaut (who acted as his backing band) and Tesseract.\nSharp announced a new side project with Gospel's Vinny Roseboom named The Supervoid Choral Ensemble in 2023.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2005: myspace.com/musicistight (Compilation)\n2008: The Discovery\n2010: Beacons\n2011: Let Yourself Be Huge\n2011: Loop\n2012: Fade\n2013: Subsume\n2014: Live with Intronaut (Century Media)\n2015: Woum\n2019: Unending\n2020: Loop (2020)\n2020: Solitude\n\n\n=== EPs & Singles ===\n2008: The Map Is Not the Territory\n2009: Portmanteau\n2009: ]]][[[\n2010: A New Heavenly Body (]]][[[ remixed and remastered)\n2013: Hello\n2014: Little Histories\n\n\n== References =="

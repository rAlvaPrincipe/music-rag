    "text": "Dark Room Notes were an Irish electro/synthpop group.\nThe three founding members, Ronan Gaughan, Ruairi Ferrie and former drummer Ruairi Cavanagh originally hail from Menlo, County Galway. Later members Arran Murphy is from Wicklow, and Darragh Shanahan, who was the band's drummer for four years, comes from Dublin.\nThe band's music has been described as electro/synthpop with a slightly sombre overtone and introverted lyrical sensibility. According to Village [1] they \"seem to gather comparisons with the murkier side of electro pop, usually bands like New Order, Interpol or Joy Division. While the comparisons have some basis, DRN are far from gloomy, just a bit ... cool... But this cool does not translate into pretension, just humorous and knowledgeable asides to their favourite artists, photographers and filmmakers\".\nThe band's debut album We Love You Dark Matter was nominated for the Choice Music Prize.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDark Room Notes formed in Dublin in 2004, recruiting drummer Shanahan in 2006. They performed their first gig in Galway in December 2006. Their debut single Love Like Nicotine was released in late 2007 on Gonzo Records, and became an alternative radio hit. This was followed in summer 2007 by the Dead Start Program EP, which featured lead single Slow Puncture and an early recording of Shake Shake My Ceiling.\nThe band were selected to play on the sixth series of the acclaimed RTÉ music show Other Voices. [2]. Dark Room Notes topped the 'Viewer's Choice' poll on RTÉ [3] for Series 6 of Other Voices.\nProducers who have worked with the quartet include Flood, Tom Rixton and Ciarán Bradshaw.\nThe band recorded their debut album We Love You Dark Matter in London during the summer of 2008, with producer Ciaran Bradshaw. The album was released on Good Friday 2009 to widespread critical acclaim. DRN spent the ensuing months touring Ireland and playing all of the major festivals before being signed by BBE Records in the autumn. BBE released We Love You Dark Matter worldwide in spring 2010, preceded by the re-release of Love Like Nicotine on 8 February.\nIn January 2010 We Love You Dark Matter was nominated for the Choice Music Prize for Irish Album of the Year 2009.\nIn March 2010 DRN travelled to the CMW music festival in Toronto and SXSW in Austin, Texas.\nIn April 2010 drummer Darragh Shanahan announced his departure from the band with immediate effect.

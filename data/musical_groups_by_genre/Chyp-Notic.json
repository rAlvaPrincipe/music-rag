    "text": "Chyp-Notic were a German Eurodance group formed in 1988, who had several hits between 1990 and 1993, including a cover of \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" and \"I Can't Get Enough\".\n\n\n== History ==\nVlad Mint, Jan Erik and Walter Bee founded the band in 1988 under the name Toys. Two years later, the trio renamed to Chyp-Notic, and landed a recording contract with Coconut Records. Mint ended his training as a dental technician, Bee gave up his job as a computer programmer and Erik sold his shares at a nightclub.\nThey released their first and best-known single \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" in 1990. This uptempo cover of Sin√©ad O'Connor's cover of the Prince song reached #16 on the German singles chart. The beat is lifted from the Raze song \"Break 4 Love\". After two albums and several successes, including a top 20 placing for the third single \"I Can't Get Enough\" in 1991, the band broke up in 1994.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1990: Nothing Compares\n1992: I Can't Get Enough\nCompilations\n2008: Greatest Hits\n2015: 25\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChyp-Notic at AllMusic\nChyp-Notic discography at Discogs"

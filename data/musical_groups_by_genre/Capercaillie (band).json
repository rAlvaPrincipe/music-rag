    "text": "Capercaillie are a Scottish folk band, founded in 1984 by Donald Shaw and led by Karen Matheson, and which performs traditional Gaelic and contemporary songs in English. The group adapts traditional Gaelic music and traditional lyrics with modern production techniques and instruments such as electric guitar and bass guitar, though rarely synthesizers or drum machines. Capercaillie demonstrate \"astonishing musical dexterity\" and feature \"the peerless voice of co-founder Karen Matheson. Universally recognised as one of the finest Gaelic singers alive today\". \nThey have sold over a million albums world-wide, including \"three silver and one gold album in the UK\". The BBC notes that the band has \"achieved enormous global success both as a group and as individual musicians.\"\n\n\n== Origins ==\nOriginating from Argyll, a region of western Scotland, the band is named after the western capercaillie, sometimes called a wood grouse, a native Scottish bird.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTheir first album, Cascade, was recorded in 1984. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band gave their last performance on 17 August 2019 at the Festival des Filets Bleus in Concarneau, Brittany, France. They performed live for the first time in two years on 6 August 2021 at the Wickham Festival in Hampshire.\nAfter a further nine months off the road the band resumed touring, and between April and August 2022 performed in France, including Paris, Condette, Pas-de-Calais, Hauts-de-France,  Lorient in Brittany, and on the Tatihou islet in Normandy. They also performed concerts in Inverness and Glasgow.\nThey performed on 26 August 2023 at the Shrewsbury Folk Festival in the town of Shrewsbury in Shropshire, England.\nOn 19 February 2024, the May release of a new album, ReLoved, was announced. The album marks the band's fortieth anniversary and is their first studio release since 2013's At the Heart of It All. It contains new arrangements of some of the band's work recorded with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.  On the same day, the album's first single, \"Tobar Mhoire\", was released online.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nCapercaillie's repertoire includes both traditional Gaelic songs and tunes, as well as modern English-language songs and tunes, composed by other folk writers and musicians, or by members of the band. The group often adapt traditional Gaelic songs and music using modern production techniques, and often mix musical forms, combining traditional lyrics and tunes with modern techniques and instruments such as synthesisers, drum machines, electric guitar and bass.\nCapercaillie's first two albums, Cascade and Crosswinds featured few modern instruments and the tunes and songs were played in a more traditional arrangement. However beginning with later albums such as Sidewaulk, and the soundtrack of The Blood Is Strong, Capercaillie began to experiment with adding funk bass-lines into certain tracks, as well as synthesisers and electric guitar. This fusion style gained Capercaillie chart success in the 1990s, on albums such as Delirium and Secret People (see Chart Success, below) and reached its peak in the albums To the Moon and Beautiful Wasteland, with the remix albums Get Out and Capercaillie being released during this period.\nCapercaillie have drawn back slightly from the heavy fusion style featured on their albums the 1990s, and their more recent albums from Nàdurra (2003) up to At the Heart of It All (2013) feature more traditional arrangements and instruments, while still retaining a slight fusion feel.\nThe opening track from their 2000 album Nàdurra, \"Skye Waulking Song\", was used in the Edexcel Music GCSE Specification from 2009 to 2016. The song was in the world music section, and was used as a representation of traditional folk music combined with rock music.\n\n\n== Chart success ==\nTheir 1992 EP, A Prince Among Islands, was the first Scottish Gaelic-language record to have a single that reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart: \"Coisich A Ruin\" peaked at No. 39. Another single, \"Dark Alan (Ailein duinn)\" reached No. 65 in the UK Singles Chart in June 1995.\nThe album Secret People (1993) reached No. 40, and To the Moon (1995) peaked at No. 41 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nCascade (1984)\nCrosswinds (1987)\nSidewaulk (1989)\nDelirium (1991)\nSecret People (1993)\nTo the Moon (1995)\nBeautiful Wasteland (1997)\nNàdurra (2000)\nChoice Language (2003)\nRoses and Tears (2008)\nAt the Heart of It All (2013)\nReLoved (2024) (re-recording of previously released tracks)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nLive in Concert (2002)\n\n\n=== Soundtrack albums ===\nThe Blood Is Strong (1988)\nGlenfinnan (Songs of the '45) (1998, recorded in 1995)\n\n\n=== Remix albums ===\nGet Out (1992) (a compilation album of B-sides, remixes & unreleased studio and live tracks)\nCapercaillie (1994) (a compilation album of re-worked and remixed tracks)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nDusk till Dawn: The Best of Capercaillie (1998)\nWaulk Roots (1998) Tracks from early albums Crosswinds and Sidewaulk\nGrace and Pride: The Anthology 2004-1984 (2004)\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nKaren Matheson – vocals (1984 – present)\nCharlie McKerron – fiddle (1986 – present)\nMichael McGoldrick – flute, whistle, uilleann pipes (1997 – present)\nManus Lunny – bouzouki, guitar (1989 – present)\nDonald Shaw – keyboards, accordion (1984 – present)\nEwen Vernal – bass (1998 – present)\nDavid \"Chimp\" Robertson – percussion (1997 – present)\nChe Beresford – drums (1998 – present)\nJames Mackintosh – drums (1992 – 1993, 2000, 2013)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nMarc Duff – whistle, recorder, wind synthesizer, bodhrán (1984–1995)\nFred Morrison – Highland small pipes and low whistle (1995–1997)\nJohn Saich – bass, guitar (1988–1998)\nShaun Craig – guitar, bouzouki (1984–1988)\nAnton Kirkpatrick – guitar (1988–1989)\nMartin MacLeod – bass, fiddle (1984–1988)\nJoan Maclachlan – fiddle, vocals (1984–1986)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCapercaillie's official website\nVertical Records website\nCapercaillie's Valley Entertainment Artist Page\nCapercaillie's Complete Discography\nAn outdated but somewhat useful FAQ of Capercaillie (covers activity up to 1995)"

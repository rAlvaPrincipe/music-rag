    "text": "The Hardchargers are a blues and Americana band from Northern Ireland. Established in 2009 as a three-piece, the current lineup is \"Lonesome\" Chris Todd (guitars and lead vocals), with drums and bass guitar provided at any given performance by a selection of musicians including Ali MacKenzie, Jan Uhrin (bass guitar) and Davy Kennedy, Peter Uhrin, Gerard O’Scolaidhe (drums). The band has released three singles, an EP, one studio album and one live album. The band's original music has been likened to pre-WW2 Mississippi blues, Hill country blues, and artists such as Howlin' Wolf and Frankie Lee Sims.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Hardchargers were formed in 2009 by Chris Todd, Dave Thompson and Richard J. Hodgen.\nIn 2011 the band made its first release, extended play Bumpin′ and Grindin′. Three singles followed in 2013: \"Fine & Filthy / Just Somebody's Friend\",\"Spanner in Your Works / JoJo\" and \"Little Too Late / No Stone Unturned\".\nThe band's debut album, Scarecrow, was recorded in Belfast in 2017, with support from a crowd-funding campaign and sponsors. During 2017 Todd accompanied eminent harmonica player Billy Boy Miskimmin (previously of The Yardbirds and Nine Below Zero) on tour across the UK. Before the launch of the album in December 2017, Thompson and Hodgen left the band, and the Todd recruited bassist Ali MacKenzie and drummer Davy Kennedy for the launch performance. Since then, the live lineup has been completed by members of a pool of musicians including MacKenzie and Kennedy, Jan and Peter Uhrin and Gerard O’Scolaidhe, occasionally joined by guest soloists that had performed on the album. The album was officially released on Market Square Records in January 2018.\nThe Scarecrow launch performance in December 2017 was recorded, and resulted in the live album And Now... Live at the Belfast Empire, released in June 2018.\n\n\n== Lineup ==\nChris Todd – lead vocals, guitars, mandolin (2009–present)\nAli MacKenzie – bass guitar (2017–present)\nDavy Kennedy – drums (2017–present)\nJan Uhrin – bass guitar (2017–present)\nPeter Uhrin – drums (2017–present)\nGerard O’Scolaidhe – drums (2018–present)\n\n\n=== Additional musicians ===\nAmanda Agnew – backing vocals (Scarecrow album)\nSean Doone – banjo (Scarecrow album)\nScott Flanigan – organ, piano (Scarecrow and And Now...

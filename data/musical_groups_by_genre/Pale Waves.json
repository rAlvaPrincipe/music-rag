    "text": "Pale Waves are an English rock band from Manchester, formed in 2014. Lead singer and guitarist Heather Baron-Gracie met drummer Ciara Doran while attending university in Manchester and they formed a band. Guitarist Hugo Silvani and bassist Charlie Wood soon joined and completed the lineup. The band's early work is often described as 80s-inspired indie rock or synth-pop; their second and third albums, however, owe more to the pop-punk genre.\nAfter signing a record deal with Dirty Hit in 2017, Pale Waves released their debut single, \"There's a Honey\", followed by \"Television Romance\". In 2018, the band were ranked fifth in the BBC Sound of 2018 poll and won the NME Under the Radar Award at the NME Awards. Pale Waves' debut EP, All the Things I Never Said, was released in February 2018, followed by their albums, My Mind Makes Noises, (2018), Who Am I? (2021), and Unwanted (2022). The band's fourth album, Smitten, was released on 27 September 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2014–2017: Formation and early career ===\n\nPale Waves formed in 2014 when drummer Ciara Doran met Heather Baron-Gracie while attending BIMM Manchester. The two originally named their group \"Creek\", but they soon changed it to \"Pale Waves\", basing the name on a painting Baron-Gracie's grandmother had created. Doran and Baron-Gracie initially enlisted second guitarist Ben Bateman and bassist Ryan Marsden to complete the lineup. Later that year both members were asked to leave and departed from the band shortly thereafter, with current bassist Charlie Wood and second guitarist Hugo Silvani replacing them. The band recorded early demos with production team Sugar House that were released in 2015. These tracks caught the attention of XFM radio broadcaster John Kennedy, who referred them to the independent record label Dirty Hit. Pale Waves was subsequently signed to the label in 2017.\nThe band's first single under Dirty Hit, \"There's a Honey\", was released on 21 April 2017 to widespread acclaim. On 1 June 2017, the band played a sold-out show at Madison Square Garden supporting the 1975 on their North American tour. The band's second single, \"Television Romance\", was released on 16 August 2017, with its music video directed by The 1975 lead singer Matty Healy. Healy later appeared on the cover of NME with Baron-Gracie for the 20 October 2017 issue of the magazine. Pale Waves embarked on their first North American headlining tour in November and December 2017, playing 21 shows over four weeks.\nThe band headlined DIY magazine's Class of 2018 shortlist for its December/January issue. On 7 November 2017, the band released the single \"New Year's Eve\", followed by \"My Obsession\" on 13 December 2017.\n\n\n=== 2018–2019: All the Things I Never Said and My Mind Makes Noises ===\nBaron-Gracie announced on 4 January 2018 via Twitter that the band had started recording their debut album. On 8 January, it was announced that the band had been placed fifth in the BBC Sound of 2018 poll. Speaking to the BBC, Baron-Gracie talked about how the band's debut album is shaping up and its darker tone: \"The songs we have out now are very influenced by romance. The album is me talking about a lot of my darker issues. I talk about a lot of things that go on in my mind rather than in my heart\". \"The Tide\", the first song written by the band, was released on 1 February 2018 as the third single from the band's then-upcoming debut extended play (EP), All the Things I Never Said.\nPale Waves won the NME Under the Radar Award at the NME Awards 2018, and performed \"There's a Honey\" at the ceremony at London's O2 Academy Brixton on 14 February 2018. The band also received a nomination for Best Video for \"Television Romance\", but lost out to The Big Moon.\nPale Waves' debut EP, All the Things I Never Said, was released digitally on 20 February 2018, followed by a 12-inch vinyl release on 16 March 2018. On 6 April 2018, it was announced that the band had signed to Interscope Records in a joint venture with Dirty Hit to release music in the United States. The third single from the band's debut album, \"Kiss\", following \"There's a Honey\" and \"Television Romance\", was released on 15 May 2018. \"Noises\" was released as the fourth single on 28 June 2018.\nIn an interview with NME magazine in early September 2018 the band revealed they are working on a new EP following the debut album. Baron-Gracie discussed how the new EP will lean towards \"pop punk and rock'n'roll\" and will touch on themes such as politics, acceptance and sexuality. The band's debut album, My Mind Makes Noises, was released on 14 September 2018 and reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\n=== 2019–2022: Who Am I? ===\n\nSpeaking to NME while at Radio 1's Big Weekend in May 2019, Baron-Gracie updated on the progress of the EP, saying the band \"[had] so many songs\" and that they would cut the amount to \"five or six tracks\" with the remainder that \"will probably go on the album\". However, in September 2019 the band reported they will no longer be doing an EP, rather \"diving deep into the second album\". On 17 October 2019 the band won the Q Best Breakthrough Act at the Q Awards 2019.\nIn January 2020 Pale Waves released the song \"SkinDeepSkyHighHeartWide\" in collaboration with Lawrence Rothman for The Turning official motion picture soundtrack. A few months later, in March 2020, the band were involved in a road accident on their way to support Halsey in Berlin. The group's tour bus rolled off the road, leaving them trapped in the bus. Minor injuries were sustained in the accident and the tour bus burnt out. Ciara Doran on Instagram described the incident, \"We honestly thought we were going to die. The injuries will heal but this will stay with me and everyone involved for forever.\"\nThe band's second album, Who Am I?, was announced on 10 November 2020 along with its lead single \"Change\", which was named as Annie Mac's Hottest Record in the World. Baron-Gracie and Doran, both of whom are members of the LGBTQ+ community, aimed for the album to be \"a voice for LGBTQ+ people\". The album was partially recorded in Los Angeles with Rich Costey though COVID-19 restrictions forced the band to return to the U.K. and finish the remainder of the album remotely. Of making an album during the pandemic, Baron-Gracie confessed that \"for me, music and art is for people not to feel so alone and isolated. I want to be that person my fans look up to and find comfort in.\" Who Am I? was released on 12 February 2021 and reached number 3 on UK Albums Chart.\n\n\n=== 2022–2024: Unwanted ===\nThe band's third studio album, Unwanted, was released on 12 August 2022. It was supported by singles \"Lies\", \"Reasons to Live\", \"Jealousy\", \"The Hard Way\", and \"Clean\", all of which were released during the spring and summer months of 2022. Taking heavy inspiration from the likes of Paramore, Courtney Love, and Liz Phair, the album was a pivot into pop-punk, deviating further from their indie-pop and dream-pop roots.\nThe following month, in September 2022, Pale Waves went on to perform shows in North America, and were set to complete touring on October 7; however, on September 20, the remaining dates in the United States were canceled due to safety concerns over their tour bus. In November, the band played various shows in the United Kingdom and Japan.\n\n\n=== 2024–present: Smitten ===\nIn June 2024, the band announced that its fourth studio album, Smitten, would be released on 27 September 2024. The album was preceded by the singles \"Perfume\", \"Glasgow\", \"Gravity\", and \"Thinking About You\".\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nPale Waves have been described as indie pop, indie rock, synth-pop, goth-pop, pop-punk, pop rock, dream pop, and pop. The band have cited artists such as The Blue Nile, Prince, The Cranberries, Cocteau Twins, The 1975, Alanis Morissette and Avril Lavigne as influences. Baron-Gracie has stated, \"I love a lot of '80s artists like Prince and Madonna. 'Purple Rain' is one of my favorite songs of all time. But I love The Cure. I love songs that give you melodies that you can sing at any time, but within those melodies, there are things that break your heart.\" In an interview with The Irish Times, Baron-Gracie cited Dolores O'Riordan as her main vocal influence, saying: \"I love The Cranberries. They were amazing. I definitely looked up to Dolores O’Riordan. She has one of my favourite voices of all time. She gave off that attitude – she was totally herself. I loved her fashion sense, she was such a cool person\".\nFor their second album, Who Am I?, Baron-Gracie cited country artists The Chicks and Kacey Musgraves as influences, particularly on \"the melodic side of [the] record.\" Their third album, Unwanted, was inspired by female rock artists Courtney Love and Liz Phair, and pop-punk band Paramore.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n=== Promotional singles ===\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nPale Waves at AllMusic"

    "text": "The Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming is a British Army training establishment that provides instruction on Scottish pipe band music to military pipers and drummers.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 1910 as the Army School of Piping (later renamed the Army School of Bagpipe Music), the School was formerly located at Edinburgh Castle but is now located at Inchdrewer House near Redford Barracks in Edinburgh, Scotland and is administered by the Infantry Training Centre, it is also affiliated with the Royal Corps of Army Music.  Generally regarded as the smallest unit in the British Army, the School is now commanded by a Director who is a qualified army Pipe Major and who usually holds the rank of Captain or Major (usually being commissioned from Warrant Officer rank on appointment).  The Director is assisted by a Chief Instructor, who is the Senior Pipe Major of the British Army.\nThe School provides courses at different levels to pipers and drummers of the British Armed Forces throughout the year, and qualified instructors are drawn from the pipes and drums of various units in the British Army.  The School accepts students from Commonwealth armed forces, but not civilians. It has in the past provided instruction to various police band members, but this has not taken place for a number of years.\nThe School forms part of the Piping and Drumming Qualifications Board, which is a collaboration among the Piobaireachd Society, the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association, the College of Piping, and the National Piping Centre. Together, the Institute sets a standardised piping certificate programme for students from around the world.\n\n\n== British Armed Forces Pipe Bands ==\n\nPipes and Drums of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards\nPipes and Drums of the Royal Dragoon Guards\nPipes and Drums of the Queen's Royal Hussars\nPipes and Drums of the Royal Tank Regiment\nPipes and Drums of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry (Reserve)\nPipes and Drums of the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards\nDrums and Pipes of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards\nPipes and Drums of the Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland\nPipes and Drums of the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland\nPipes and Drums of the Highlanders, 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland\nPipes and Drums of the 52nd Lowland, 6th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (Reserves)\nPipes and Drums of the 51st Highland, 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (Reserves)\nPipes and Drums of the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)\nPipes and Drums of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment) (Reserves)\nPipes and Drums of the 1st Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles\nPipes and Drums of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles\nPipes and Drums of the Queen's Own Gurkha Logistic Regiment\nPipes and Drums of the Queen's Gurkha Signals\nPipes and Drums of the Queen's Gurkha Engineers\nPipes and Drums of 19th Regiment, Royal Artillery\nPipes and Drums of the 103rd (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Regiment Royal Artillery (Reserves)\nPipes and Drums of the London Scottish (Reserves, now London Guards)\nPipes and Drums of the London Irish Rifles (Reserves, now London Guards)\nPipes and Drums of the Royal Corps of Signals\nPipes and Drums of City of Edinburgh UOTC\nDrums and Pipes of Aberdeen UOTC\nPipes and Drums of Glasgow and Strathclyde UOTC\nPipes and Drums of Tayforth UOTC\nPipes and Drums of 102 Battalion REME (Reserves)\n\n\n=== Royal Air Force ===\nRAF Halton Pipes and Drums\nRAF Central Scotland Pipes and Drums\nRAF Cosford Pipes and Drums\nRAF Lossiemouth Pipes and Drums\nRAF Waddington Pipes and Drums\nPipes and Drums of 2622 (Highland) Squadron\n\n\n== Directors ==\nPipe Major John MacDonald of Inverness, Queens Own Cameron Highlanders, (1910–1914)\nPipe Major John Grant,  Seaforth Highlanders, (1914–1918)\nPipe Major Willie Ross, Scots  Guards, (1919–1958)\nCaptain John A MacLellan MBE,  Queen's Own Highlanders, (1959–1976) \nCaptain Andrew Pitkeathly, Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders, (1976–1981)\nMajor John M Allan MBE, Queen's Own Highlanders, (1981–1990)\nMajor Gavin N M Stoddart MBE BEM, Royal Highland Fusiliers, (1990–2003)\nCaptain Stuart D Samson MBE, The Highlanders,  (2003–2008)\nMajor Steven Small MBE,  Black Watch (2008–2016)\nMajor Gordon Rowan MBE, Royal Regiment of Scotland,  (2016–2024)\nMajor Ross McCrindle, Scots  Guards,  (2024–present)\n\n\n== See also ==\nMusic schools in Scotland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming – on British Army official website"

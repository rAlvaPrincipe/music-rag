    "text": "Lethian Dreams is a French doom metal band, founded in 2002 by Carline Van Roos and Matthieu Sachs, also known for their \nwork in the bands Aythis and Remembrance. Starting as an atmospheric doom metal band, Lethian Dreams evolved later to a more ethereal sound, adding elements from different musical styles. The band self-describes its music as \"ethereal doom metal\" but elements from black metal, shoegaze or post-metal can also be found in their music.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter releasing 3 demos from 2002 to 2006, the band released its first album Bleak Silver Streams in 2009. This first work summed up the result of the 5 first years of existence of the band by featuring most of the songs from the demos. The music blends atmospheric keyboards, heavy guitars with ethereal voices and death vocals. A style clearly enrooted in atmospheric doom metal and often compared to bands such as Anathema or the 3rd and the Mortal. The first album is also the only album (except from the demos) to feature death growls, which are performed by Carlos D'Agua (Before the Rain). In 2012, the band released its second album, this time with brand new songs, in a style different from the previous one : the band focuses on the ethereal side of their music and uses rawer guitar riffing.\nIn October 2013, the band announced the recording of their 3rd album. The album, Red Silence Lodge was released in 2014.\n\n\n== Current members ==\nMatthieu Sachs – guitars, keyboards (2002–present)\nCarline Van Roos – guitars, keyboards, drums, bass, vocals (2002–present)\nPierre Bourguignon – drums (2013–present)\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nCarlos D'Agua – harsh vocals (2006–2009)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBleak Silver Streams (2009)\nSeason of Raven Words (2012)\nRed Silence Lodge (2014)\nA Shadow of Memories (2020)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nJust Passing By and Unreleased Requiems (2011)\nLast Echoes of Silence (2021)\n\n\n=== Demos ===\nMournful Whispers (2003)\nLost in Grief (2004)\nRequiem for My Soul, Eternal Rest for My Heart (2006)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLethian Dreams website\nLethian Dreams @ Encyclopaedia Metallum\nLethian Dreams @ Metalstorm\nLethian Dreams @ Doom-metal.com\nRemembrance – other band of Carline Van Roos and Matthieu Sachs\nAythis - solo project from Carline Van Roos"

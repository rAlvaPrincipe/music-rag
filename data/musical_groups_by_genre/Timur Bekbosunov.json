Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth said Black Lodge is \"ripping through the fabric of future vision psychosis where the integrity of classic form clasps the hands of radical possibilities.”  The opera film is directed by Michael Joseph McQuilken. The Wall Street Journal describes vocals sounding \"alternately like a baroque countertenor, a baritone, a rocker and a crooner.” Black Lodge was nominated in the 66th Annual Grammy Awards for a Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording.

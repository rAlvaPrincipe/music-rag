    "text": "VIRTA (meaning electricity, energy or a stream) is a Finnish band founded in Kuopio in 2011 by Antti Hevosmaa on trumpet and vocals, Heikki Selamo on guitar and vocals and Erik Fr√§ki on drums and percussion. All of the band members are heavily equipped with electronic effects, samplers and other digital sound processors they use to manipulate the sounds of their instruments. Today the band locates in Helsinki. The group is known for their particular sounds and sights that they create with their instruments, the sound system and live lights when performing live.\nThe mostly instrumental sound of VIRTA stands somewhere between Nordic jazz, post-rock and modern electronic music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nTales from the Deep Waters (2012, Tourist Information)\nHurmos (2016, Svart Records)\n\n\n== References =="

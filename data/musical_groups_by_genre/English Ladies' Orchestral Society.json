    "text": "The English Ladies' Orchestral Society was one of the first and largest amateur orchestras for women in the UK, founded in 1893. It had over 100 members, including a full band of wind and strings. The primary organisers were Mary Venables and\nMarian Arkwright. The conductor (a man) was Mr. J. S. Liddle, organist of St Nicholas' Parish Church in Newbury and also the conductor of the Newbury Choral Society from 1884 until his death in 1921. Liddle first organised a series of concerts featuring orchestras for female players in 1877.  \nThe orchestra held its rehearsals in London, and concerts were often held in provincial towns, often in aid of charitable causes. Its first public concert was given at Chelmsford in 1893. One later concert, held in Leeds on 29 October 1903, featured Max Bruch's op. 28 Symphony conducted by Liddle, and Hubert Parry's Lady Radnor's Suite, conducted by the composer. The orchestra was still performing in 1910.\n\n\n== Ladies-only orchestras ==\nOther orchestras for women active during the same period included Helen Matilda Chaplin's string orchestra (founded in 1881 as the Lady Folkestone's Band and later as Lady Radnor's Band), the Aeolian Ladies' Orchestra (professional, founded 1886 by Rosabel Watson), Eleanor Clausen's Orchestra of Young Ladies (founded 1890, all Guildhall students), the Haresfoot Ladies' Band in Berkhampstead, the Lady William Lennox's Orchestra and Mrs. Hunt's Ladies' Orchestra. Partly due to a shortage of male musicians as war was declared in 1914, female musicians - including Rebecca Clarke (viola) and Jessie Grimson (violin) - were gradually admitted into mainstream, mixed professional orchestras such as Henry Wood's Queen's Hall Orchestra for the first time.\nThe Society of Women Musicians was founded in 1911. The London Womenâ€™s Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1922 by Elisabeth Kuyper. Gwynne Kimpton founded the British Women's Symphony Orchestra in 1923. Kathleen Riddick was the founder of the London Women's String Orchestra in 1938. In the US Ethel Leginska headed the Boston Woman's Symphony Orchestra (1926-1930), founded the National Women's Symphony Orchestra in New York in 1932 and served as director of the Chicago Women's Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n== References =="

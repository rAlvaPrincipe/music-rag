    "text": "Puffy (sometimes stylized in all-caps), also known as Puffy AmiYumi in the US, are a Japanese pop rock duo formed in Tokyo in 1995, consisting of singers Ami Ōnuki (born in Machida, Tokyo '73/9/18) and Yumi Yoshimura (born in Neyagawa, Osaka Pref. '75/1/30). In the United States, they adopted the name Puffy AmiYumi to avoid legal naming conflicts with Sean Combs, who also performed under the name Puffy. The duo sings in Japanese as well as in English and in Mandarin Chinese.\nBoth Ami and Yumi were scouted by Sony-affiliated talent agencies and put together in the mid-1990s. Most of their work was produced or co-written by Okuda Tamio and Andy Sturmer, formerly of the bands Unicorn and Jellyfish, respectively.\nThe duo's first single, Asia no Junshin (1996), sold one million records. They gained mainstream success in Japan in 1998 following the release of their album, Jet and continued with several more full-length releases (totaling 15 million sales in Japan).\nIn 2004, an animated series featuring animated versions of themselves, Hi! Hi! Puffy AmiYumi, premiered on the US's Cartoon Network. Although their characters were voiced by different voice actresses, the singers portrayed themselves for short live-action segments taped in Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut activities (early - mid-'90's) ===\nWhen Ōnuki was in high school, she sang for a band called Hanoi Sex that participated in a Sony SD Audition and passed, becoming employees of Sony Music Entertainment. She later took vocal lessons and attended a professional school to learn how to become a better performer. The band eventually disbanded, leaving only Ami under Sony's employment. She was encouraged to stay despite lacking a band and a clear musical direction.\nYoshimura had learned of the Chotto Sokomade talent search underway by Sony Music Artists at the age of 18. After passing the company's audition, Yumi moved on her own from Ōsaka to Tōkyō, where she eventually met Ami by chance in the Sony Music offices. Both felt alone within the large Sony organization and were not confident in their abilities as solo artists. Although Ōnuki had recorded a solo CD under the guidance of former Unicorn frontman Okuda Tamio, which later become half of solosolo, she and Yumi requested Sony pair them as a duo.\n\n\n=== Debut and beginnings (1995, '96, '97) ===\nProducer and American pop musician Andy Sturmer christened them as \"Puffy\", and is considered by both Ami and Yumi as \"the godfather of Puffy\". Ami had previously met Tamio at a Sparks Gogo concert, and he had produced her then-unreleased solo CD. He was eventually signed on to produce the duo's first studio album, titled AmiYumi.  Their debut single, \"Asia no Junshin\", launched a big craze known to some as “Puffy-mania.” Asked if they were surprised by the attention after its success, Yumi told an interviewer \"... everything that was put together for that song all came together and made it happen, but we didn't expect it. It was luck.\"\nOn July 13, 2005, their song Song of Origin (はじまりのうた, Hajimari no Uta) was used as the ending theme of the eighth Pokémon film: Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew.\n\n\n=== Puffy in the United States (2000 - '06, 2017) ===\n\nPuffy made their first appearance in the United States as part of Music Japan's \"An Evening with Japan's All-Stars\" showcase at the 2000 South by Southwest festival in Austin, TX. Soon after their SXSW performance, attorneys for Sean \"Puffy\" Combs sent the band a cease and desist letter asking them to change their name. After adopting the new name \"Puffy AmiYumi\", they told Entertainment Weekly: \n\nYumi: It doesn't bother us at all. We respect the fact that Puff Daddy is Puffy in the U.S.Ami: The bottom line is that we don't know what the word “puffy” means. We were given our name by somebody else (Andy Sturmer) six years ago, and we really don't have a clue.\nAfter their show, Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Puffy ended production in 2002, Puffy focused on performing in the United States. Several of their previous Japanese albums were released for the US market and they recorded theme songs for the animated series Teen Titans and SD Gundam Force. They have also done a cover version with Cyndi Lauper of her hit \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\". They also performed their songs \"Hi Hi\" and \"Red Swing\"  on the show. They came back to the US in 2006 for their Splurge Tour, and also toured with Tally Hall for the Super-Ultimate Awesome Exploration tour the same year. In January 2017, they announced their Not Lazy tour to hold place in April. That same month, the band made an appearance at Anime Boston for autograph signings.\n\n\n=== Animated series ===\nOn November 19, 2004, an animated series featuring cartoon versions of Ami and Yumi, titled Hi! Hi! Puffy AmiYumi, premiered on the United States' Cartoon Network on their Friday-night block, Fridays. Despite both of them being voiced by American actresses (although Janice Kawaye, who plays Ami, is of Japanese descent), the real Puffy AmiYumi star in short live-action segments video-recorded in Japan. The series also featured some of the duo's best songs around the time.\n\nYumi said in an interview with LiveDaily: Yumi: The Cartoon Network show has given us a great opportunity to introduce the music to a new audience. When we toured, after the Cartoon Network show started, so many little kids came to our show. We always wanted as many people as possible to listen to the music.\nThe duo then made an appearance and performed in the 2005 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade where they were also represented by their own Hi! Hi! Puffy AmiYumi float and balloon.\nOn January 16, 2006, Puffy AmiYumi were appointed goodwill ambassadors to the United States as part of the Japanese government's campaign to encourage tourism in Japan.\nPuffy AmiYumi also performed cameo voiceovers in episode 9 of the 2011 anime series, Bunny Drop, airing on July 8, 2011. They also performed the opening theme to the anime.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nPuffy AmiYumi has collaborated with producer Tamio Okuda and American singer-songwriter Andy Sturmer. The duo's vocals have been compared to American vocal sister group The Roches. \n\n\n== Members ==\nAmi Ōnuki, Yumi Yoshimura - lead vocalists\nFumio Yanagisawa - lead guitarist, backing vocalist\nTakeshi Tsuji - keyboardist, backing vocalist\nHiroharu Kinoshita - bassist, backing vocalist\nTakashi Furuta - drummer, percussionist\nJunichi Fujimoto - rhythm guitarist\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nThe following is a list of albums published under the names Puffy/Puffy AmiYumi and their release dates.\n\nAmiYumi, 1996\nsolosolo, 1997\nJet, 1998\nFever*Fever, 1999\nSpike, 2000, ‘01 in the US and Canada\nThe Hit Parade, 2002\nNice., early 2003, mid-‘03 in the US and Canada\n59, 2004\nSplurge, 2006\nhoneycreeper, 2007\nPuffy AmiYumi x Puffy and Bring It!, 2009\nThank You, 2011\nThe Puffy, 2021\n\n\n== Television works ==\n1997–2000: Saku Saku Morning Call\n1997–2002: Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Puffy\n2003–2006: Teen Titans theme\n2004–2006: Hi!

    "text": "DaYeene was a Swedish soul/house music group active in the early 1990s. It consisted of the sisters Jeanette and Diane Söderholm. Diane had previously been a vocalist in the Swedish synthpop band Freestyle.\nThe duo was one of many new Swedish acts associated with the early 1990s Nordik beat scene that specialized in urban music. Notable artists were Papa Dee, Kayo, Rob'n'Raz, and Titiyo. DaYeene guest featured on most of these artists' albums. They were signed to the label SweMix, one of the very early Swedish labels specializing in urban music.\nThe duo got started when SweMix co-founder StoneBridge did a remix for Frankie LaMotte in 1989, and needed backing vocalists. He loved their voices and signed the sisters.\nWhile the first single, \"We're On This Case\", was a Salt-n-Pepa inspired hip hop track with the two sisters rapping, the majority of their output was soulful club music. \"And It Hurts\" was released as a single in the summer of 1999, including in the UK. Two albums were released in the 1990s, with their biggest hits being \"Alright\" in February 1991, and \"Revelation\" in November 1993. It belatedly peaked at No. 63 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1999.\nDuring this time, Jeanette Söderholm also worked as an in-house backing vocalist at Cheiron Studios.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nUnited Soul Power (1990)\n\"Believe\"\t 2:05\n\"Big Bad World\"\t 4:37\n\"I Found You\"\t 3:19\n\"D.D.D.

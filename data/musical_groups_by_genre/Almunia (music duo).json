Their debut album New Moon, released in 2011 by British record label Claremont 56, has been described as \"nu-disco\", \"nu-balearic\" and \"a sweet heady mix of overdubbed disco, guitars and psyched out grooves\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nNew Moon (Claremont 56, 2011)\nPulsar (Claremont 56, 2013)\nSingles & EPs\n\n\"New Moon\" / \"Traveler\" (12\") (Claremont 56, 2011)\n\"Pulsar\" (12\") (Claremont 56, 2012)\n\"One Time\" (12\") (Above Machine, 2013)\n\"Cassandras Dream\" (digital) (No Static Records, 2013)\n\"The Shiny River\" (digital) (United Recordings, 2013)\n\"Meaning of Time\" (10\") (Is It Balearic?

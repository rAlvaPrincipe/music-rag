    "text": "The String Trio of New York is an American jazz chamber ensemble.\nThe group was founded in 1977, by bassist John Lindberg, violinist Billy Bang, and guitarist James Emery. Though they initially worked on improvisational playing and on their own compositions, they eventually began taking on commissions, as well as doing arrangements of other jazz musicians' works. Their debut album was issued in 1979, and the group maintained the same line-up until May 1986, when Bang left and was replaced by Charles Burnham. Burnham was replaced by Regina Carter after his departure in 1991, who then left in the mid-1990s. Diane Monroe then joined the group through 2001, after which Rob Thomas joined.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nFirst String (Black Saint, 1979)\nArea Code 212 (Black Saint, 1981)\nCommon Goal (Black Saint, 1983)\nRebirth of a Feeling (Black Saint, 1983)\nNatural Balance (Black Saint, 1986)\nAs Tears Go By (Newedition, 1987)\nString Trio of New York & Jay Clayton (West Wind, 1988)\nTime Never Lies (Vintage Jazz 1990)\nAscendant (Stash, 1991)\nIntermobility (Arabesque, 1992)\nOctagon (Black Saint, 1992)\nLive Au Petit Faucheux (AA, 1993)\nBlues...?

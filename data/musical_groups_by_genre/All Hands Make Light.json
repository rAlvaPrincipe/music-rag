    "text": "All Hands_Make Light (stylized as ALL HANDS_MAKE LIGHT) is a Canadian experimental noise-pop duo, consisting of singer Ariel Engle and instrumentalist Efrim Menuck.\nThe project was launched in 2020 after Engle, associated with AroarA and Broken Social Scene, and Menuck, a member of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, decided to work on something together, and took shape through filesharing over the internet after the COVID-19 pandemic limited opportunities to collaborate in person. They released their self-titled debut album in 2021, and gave their first live performances including an appearance at the 2021 Pop Montreal festival.\nThey followed up in 2023 with Darling the Dawn, which was longlisted for the 2023 Polaris Music Prize.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nDarling the Dawn (2023)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nALL HANDS_MAKE LIGHT (2021)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAll Hands Make Light at AllMusic \nAll Hands Make Light discography at Discogs \nAll Hands Make Light discography at MusicBrainz"

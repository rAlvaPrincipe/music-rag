    "text": "Maze, also known as Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly and Frankie Beverly & Maze, is an American soul  band founded by Frankie Beverly in Philadelphia in 1970. Under its original name Raw Soul, the band moved to San Francisco and was introduced to Marvin Gaye. Gaye took the group on the road with him as one of his opening acts, and in 1976, he suggested that they change their name from Raw Soul.\nMaze released nine Gold albums from 1977 to 1993. Their well-known songs include \"Happy Feelings,\" \"While I'm Alone,\" \"Golden Time of Day,\" “Southern Girl,” \"The Look in Your Eyes,\" \"Joy and Pain,\" \"Before I Let Go,\" \"We Are One,\" \"Back in Stride,\" \"Can't Get Over You\" and \"The Morning After.\" The band has maintained a large and devoted following.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFrankie Beverly started the band as Raw Soul in 1970. They recorded a couple of singles on the small Gregar label, but without any major hits. With a few personnel changes, a move from Philadelphia to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1971, and an introduction to Marvin Gaye, the band became an immediate success. Gaye took the band on the road with him as one of his curtain-raising acts, and in 1976, he suggested that they change their name from Raw Soul to something more appealing. And so, with a lot of back and forth throwing names around, founding member Roame came up with the name Maze.\nMaze signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in 1976, and released their debut album, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, in 1977.  Hit singles from that album include \"Happy Feelin's\", \"While I'm Alone\", and \"Lady of Magic\", giving them their first gold record and earning Maze a devoted following. They had success with the albums Golden Time of Day (1978), Inspiration (1979), and Joy and Pain (1980). The group has said that their hit single “Southern Girl” was dedicated to all southern women from Virginia to Texas. Their next recording was Live in New Orleans, three quarters of which was recorded at the Saenger Theatre, on November 14–15, 1980. Three of those songs were on the US R&B chart, including \"Running Away\", \"Before I Let Go\", and \"We Need Love to Live\". By that time, the band had a reputation in America and enjoyed a following in the United Kingdom with promotional support from the British DJ Robbie Vincent. In May 1985, Maze sold out eight nights at the Hammersmith Odeon.\nThe band released their next album, Can't Stop the Love in March 1985, which featured the group's first number one R&B hit \"Back In Stride.\" The Top 5 follow-up, \"Too Many Games\" was also featured on the album. The latter single became the band's biggest hit in the UK, where it peaked at number 36 on the UK Singles Chart.\nIn 1989, they signed with Warner Bros. and released the hit album Silky Soul, plus Back to Basics in 1993, and released the live DVD recording at London's Hammersmith Odeon in 1994. The two albums also attained gold disc status. They had another number one R&B success with \"Can't Get Over You\". In 2009, a tribute to the hits of Maze was released. Called Silky Soul Music: An All Star Tribute to Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly, it included modern stars performing Maze's biggest hits with Maze acting as the backing band.\nIn recent years, it has become tradition for the audience to honor the group by dressing in all white attire, as the group has often worn while performing. On September 2, 2011, their percussionist and background singer, McKinley \"Bug\" Williams, died suddenly of an apparent heart attack. On May 9, 2023, it was reported that due to a labor dispute with Frankie's management, long-time Maze band members, Jubu, Vance Taylor, Larry Kimpel, Calvin Napper and Daniel Weatherspoon along with original member Roame left and started their own group, TMF \"The Music Forever\" Formerly of Maze. However, Beverly remained and began performing with new band members hired via Frankie's management. Frankie Beverly hung up his microphone in July 2023 with his final two concerts being held fittingly in his Hometown of Philadelphia at the Dell Music Center. Following Beverly’s retirement, the band formerly known as “Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly” plans to carry on as “Maze Honoring Frankie Beverly.” The new lead singer is Tony Lindsay, formerly of Santana.\nOn September 10, 2024, Frankie Beverly passed away at the age of 77.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Videos ==\nLive in New Orleans (1981)\nLive in Los Angeles (1986)\nLive in London (1994)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMaze at AllMusic\nMaze discography at Discogs\nMaze at IMDb"

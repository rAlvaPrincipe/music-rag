    "text": "Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir (EPCC) is a professional choir based in Estonia.  It was founded in 1981 by Tõnu Kaljuste, who was its conductor for twenty years. In 2001, Paul Hillier followed Kaljuste's tenure, becoming the EPCC's principal conductor and artistic director until September 2008, when Daniel Reuss took over the task. Since 2014 the choir's principal conductor has been Kaspars Putniņš. The repertoire of the EPCC ranges from Gregorian Chant to modern works, particularly those of the Estonian composers Arvo Pärt and Veljo Tormis.  The group has been nominated for numerous Grammy Awards, and has won the Grammy Award for Best Choral Performance twice: in 2007 with Arvo Pärt's Da pacem and in 2014 with Pärt's Adam's Lament, the latter was shared with Tui Hirv & Rainer Vilu, Sinfonietta Rīga & Tallinn Chamber Orchestra; Latvian Radio Choir & Vox Clamantis. In 2018 Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir won the prestigious Gramophone Award with its recording of Magnificat and Nunc dimittis by Arvo Pärt and Psalms of Repentance by Alfred Schnittke (conductor Kaspars Putniņš).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nGesualdo/Erkki-Sven Tüür/Brett Dean (2015)\nGregory Rose: Danse macabre (2015)\nSibelius: Complete Works for Mixed Choir (2015)\nSiin on Ilus Elada (2014)\nBaltic Runes (2010)\nArvo Pärt: In Principio (2009)\nToivo Tulev: Songs (2008)\nScattered Rhymes: Tarik O'Regan & Guillaume de Machaut (2008)\nA New Joy (2006)\nArvo Pärt: Da pacem (2006) - won Grammy Award for Best Choral Performance 2007\nBaltic Voices 3 (2005)\nLepo Sumera: Mushroom Cantata (2005)\nRachmaninov: All-Night Vigil (2005)\nBaltic Voices 2 (2004)\nThe Powers of Heaven (2003)\nAntonio Vivaldi: Gloria, Settings from the Mass and Vespers (2003)\nBaltic Voices 1 (2002)\nAntonio Vivaldi: Salmi a due cori (2002)\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Litaniae (2000)\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Vesperae et Litania (2000)\nVeljo Tormis: Laulu palju (Liederhaufen) (2000)\nPaul Giger: Ignis (2000)\nVeljo Tormis: Litany to Thunder (1999)\nKarl August Hermann, Raimo Kangro, Leelo Tungal: Eesti lauleldused (Estonian Singspiels) (1999)\nArvo Pärt: Kanon Pokajanen (1998)\nArvo Pärt: Beatus (1997)\nVeljo Tormis: Casting a Spell (1996)\nArvo Pärt: Litany (1996)\nErkki-Sven Tüür: Crystallisatio (1996)\nKaunimad laulud (The Most Beautiful Songs) (1994)\nArvo Pärt: Te Deum (1993)\nVeljo Tormis: Forgotten Peoples (1992)\nRachmaninoff: Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff) (2022)\nOlivier Deriviere: A Plague Tale: Requiem - Main Theme (2022)\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Eesti Filharmoonia Kammerkoor at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website\nEstonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir discography at MusicBrainz"

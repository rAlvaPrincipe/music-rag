We were cursing and swearing on the street until something like a rhythm came out of it, some kind of a beat box. And when we stopped talking, the rain pattered on the roof and made this noise, which all of the sudden sound like Hip Hop, until finally the Prosetti Brothers came by and said that they want to produce us.\nTheir latest album The Takeover (CD and double vinyl) was released in 2008.\nThey also started in June 2009 their own satire magazine with its title Puppetry Fair - The Glossy Gossip Gazette.\nIn 2009, the Puppetmastaz were touring in Germany, Spain, France, Austria, Japan and Belgium on their own shows as on festivals like Pukkelpop in Belgium and Sonnenrot Festival in Eching, Munich.\nThey toured China in October 2010, the first hip hop puppet crew to do so since the Chinese opening and reform.\n\n\n== All current band members ==\nMr. Maloke: band leader, mole puppet\nTango Troublemaker: producer, rapper, blue bird puppet\nPanic,the Pig: rapper, pig puppet\nSnuggles the Bunny: rapper, rabbit puppet\nWizard The Lizard: rapper, lizard puppet\nDucci Prosetti: rapper/Producer, dragon puppet\nHipHopNotist: rapper, gecko puppet\nFrogga: rapper, frog puppet\nRicardo Prosetti: rapper/Producer, frog puppet\nFlix: rapper, bat puppet\nTurbid the Toad: frog puppet\nRyno: rapper, rhino puppet\nCroucholina: toad puppet, dancer\nCroucho: toad puppet and brother of Croucholina\nPit: Rapper, frog puppet\nDino Prosetti: producer, fish puppet\nE-Wizz: Rapper, humanly puppet\nMidi Mighty Moe: DJ, fly puppet\nBig Eye: alien puppet\nRita: reggae puppet\nKeil Pittler: demagogue puppet\nBloke: clown puppet\nLisa\nBuddha\nRichelieux\nHammerhead Rapper, Shark puppet\nDogga Dacoda\nHarold\nBumbleBee\nSquidrick A.K.A.

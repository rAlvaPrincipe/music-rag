    "text": "Delinquent Habits is an American hip hop group, formed in Norwalk, California in 1991. They are known for their Latin-tinged rap, which is both melodic and hardcore. Their first album was executive produced by Cypress Hill member Sen Dog and featured guest appearances by Sen himself as well as Puerto Rican New York City rapper Hurricane G. Their second album, Here Come the Horns, again featured Sen Dog as well as Sen's brother, pioneering Latin rapper Mellow Man Ace. The melodic Merry-Go-Round featured the female singer Michelle Belle. The group chose to focus more on hardcore rap on their fourth offering, Freedom Band.\n\n\n== History ==\nDelinquent Habits was originally made up of two emcees Kemo The Blaxican (born David L.K. Thomas, April 13, 1969) and Ives Irie (born Ivan S. Martin, August 4, 1971), and a DJ/producer O.G. Style (born Alejandro R. Martinez, July 3, 1970). Thus the group was often called Los Tres Delinquentes (Spanish spelling: los tres delincuentes;  Spanish for 'The Three Delinquents'). As a trio, they sold over 1 million copies of their single \"Tres Delinquentes\", published on the RCA label in 1996. They subsequently received a lot of attention from MTV and the media. Their self-titled debut album and their second releases were executive produced by Paul Stewart and Sen Dog. Delinquent Habits was sold almost a million copies. They have been compared to Cypress Hill. Their third album, Merry Go-Round, was published by ARK 21 Records and sold on the underground \"Spanglish network\".\nKemo soon left the band after the completion of their album Freedom Band to pursue a solo career with some substantial success. He released his debut album in 2004, titled Simple Plan. He was replaced by female vocalist Michelle Belle (born Michelle Miralles), who had been previously featured in some of their songs. She released her debut album in 2016, titled Nothing More, Nothing Less. Around five years after Kemo's exit, O.G. Style also left the band.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent\n\nIves Irie/El Guero/Guero Loco (\"Crazy White Boy\") (born Ivan S. Martin) - MC\nKemo The Blaxican (born David L.K.

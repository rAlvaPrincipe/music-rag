    "text": "Little-T and One Track Mike (sometimes stylized as Little T & One Track Mike) was an American hip-hop / alternative rock group from New Brunswick, New Jersey. Founded in 1999 while its members attended Rutgers University, the band included vocalist and lyricist Timothy \"Little-T\" Sullivan, producer and sound designer Michael \"One Track Mike\" Flannery, drummer Justin \"J-Ride\" Riddle, bass guitarist Jesse \"Savior\" Saul, and guitarist, keyboardist and backing vocalist Daniel \"Shank Bone Mystic\" Saks.\n\n\n== History ==\nTimothy Sullivan was given the nickname \"Little T\" as a child by his older brother. While attending Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1998, Sullivan introduced himself to dorm mate Michael Flannery, \"the lanky kid on the next floor with the computer and four-track\", looking for someone to help him launch a career in rap. Prior to the release of their debut album, the group performed at the last four stops of the Vans Warped Tour in August 2001. The band's first single \"Shaniqua\" found moderate success on MTV.\nSubsequently, frontman Tim Sullivan performed in a \"bad ass rock and roll\" group named Homeschool and an \"acoustic twangcore\" project named Mudfite before going solo and signing with ANTI- Records under the stage name Tim Fite.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nFome Is Dape (2001)\n\n\n=== Singles and promo ===\nFome Is Dape Sampler 1 (2001)\nFome Is Dape Sampler 2 (2001)\n\"Shaniqua\" (2001)\n\"Wings\" (2001)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLittle-T And One Track Mike on Atlantic Records\nLittle-T And One Track Mike interview with Kristi Singer\nLittle-T And One Track Mike interview with Christopher Wilcha\nLittle-T And One Track Mike interview with VH1"

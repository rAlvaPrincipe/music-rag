    "text": "Kinto Sol is a Latin hip hop group based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The group consists of three brothers: DJ Payback Garcia (Javier Garcia), El Chivo (Eduardo Garcia) and Skribe (Manuel Garcia); originally from Iramuco, Guanajuato, Mexico, they moved to the US at a very young age due to financial struggle. They rap mainly in Spanish, blending traditional Mexican music with hip hop style beats, giving them their unique sound. They own their own independent record label, Virus Enterprises LLC, which specializes in Latin hip hop. The group's name is a phonetic spelling of \"quinto sol\" (fifth sun), and is taken from an Aztec legend in which the Fifth Sun will be the last one to set in this lifetime.\nLos Hijos Del Maiz was awarded the best Latin Hip Hop album of the year for its content and best sales history.\nEl Chivo has also released two independent solo albums.

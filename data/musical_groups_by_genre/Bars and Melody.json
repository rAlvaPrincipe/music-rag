He attended the Glan Afan Comprehensive School at the time of the Britain's Got Talent competition. Previously he rapped solo under the stage name 'Little Dre'. His father said that Leondre lived with him until he appeared on Britain's Got Talent, and after that has lived with his mother. Although Leondre said that his father was a stonemason during the contest, his father now says he is a music promoter. In December 2023, Devries revealed on Instagram that Jacob had died earlier in the month but did not disclose the cause.   \n\n\n=== Charlie Lenehan (Melody) ===\nCharlie Lenehan was born 27 October 1998 in Frampton Cotterell in Gloucestershire. He lives in London. His family includes his mother, his step-father, a businessman; and a younger sister, Brooke. His mother, Karen James, is a cook in Thornbury at Gillingstool and New Siblands schools. Charlie took up singing at the age of 11 when his schoolmates invited him to join a band. He attended the Winterbourne International Academy from the age of 11, and was interested in drama, music, and engineering at the time of the competition. He returned to school the first day after the Britain's Got Talent finale.\n\n\n== Lawsuit ==\nAntonio Devries, Leondre's father, threatened to file a suit against the group in March 2016, claiming that he wrote Hopeful due to troubles that he was having in his life. He also claimed that he helped promote the boys until their Britain's Got Talent contest, that he was unhappy that the boys were moving away from the anti-bullying theme, and believed that their management overworked them. He said that he did not have any issues with Bars and Melody, but he took over the boys' social media accounts and posted music from his son Joey and other artists he represented until the management team regained control of the accounts. The management team, who Devries said was the root of the problem, stated that the boys wrote \"Hopeful\". A spokesperson for the boys shared that they were happy with their career and management team and did not feel exploited or overworked. The official statement was that \"Bars and Melody are sorry to hear that legal action is being threatened and they hope it will [be] resolved quickly and amicably.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== Promotional singles ====\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial YouTube page\nOfficial Facebook page\nBars & Melody fan Photos Leicester 2016"

Their 1998 album Feeler blended Tilley's vocals with electronic rock rhythms.\nFour of their songs were chosen for the 2000 Canadian crime drama The Spreading Ground directed by Derek Vanlint.  Virgin, Dreaming, and Paradise were used in part, and So Far Away appeared almost in its entirety at the end of the film.\nThe song Uneasy, from the album A Lifetime Away, appeared on the soundtrack to the 2007 film Weirdsville.\nA few of their songs were used in the Teton Gravity Research skiing films.\nThe samples \"Don't you believe in anything?\" and \"The future's not so bad, have faith in me\" from the song Aircraft Engines on The Sun's Running Out are Ace from the Doctor Who episode The Curse of Fenric when she speaks to the Vicar in the empty church.\nPerfume Tree's last album, Felt, was released in 2000.

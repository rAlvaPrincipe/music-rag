    "text": "Woods Tea Company is an American folk music group based in Vermont. They perform a wide variety of songs, including sea shanties, folk songs, Irish drinking songs, and Celtic music. The group is known for its energy, musical talent and dry sense of humor between songs.\n\n\n== History ==\nWoods Tea Company was started in 1981 in Burlington, Vermont, by Bruce Morgan and Rusty Jacobs. The band got its name from a wooden storage box owned by Jacobs that had \"Woods Tea Co.\" printed on its side. Mike Lussen joined the band several years later.\nMorgan left the band in the early 1990s. Howard Wooden officially joined the band in 1992, and Tom MacKenzie a year later. In 2000, MacKenzie left, and was replaced by Chip Chase.\nThe band became a regular feature at Colgate University, where the students knew the band's material. Between songs, students often shout 'Arrgh!' to poke fun at the group's sea shanties. To honor this, MacKenzie wrote a song called \"Aargh!\" for the students.\nThe band suffered several losses in its third decade. On October 6, 2006, Chase died from a massive pulmonary embolism. He had been hit by a pickup truck while riding his motorcycle several weeks earlier. A year later, on August 15, 2007, Jacobs died of a heart attack.  In July 2018, Mike Lussen died after a long illness.\nFollowing the deaths, MacKenzie started touring with the group and eventually rejoined the band full-time. In late 2008, Patti Casey became the band's newest member. In June 2010, Lussen retired from the group. MacKenzie left the band again in fall 2013 and was replaced by Pete Sutherland.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThere are currently three members of Woods Tea Company:\n\nHoward Wooden - vocals, guitar, bass, bodhran\nPete Sutherland - vocals, fiddle, mandolin, guitar, keyboard\nPatti Casey - vocals, guitar, penny whistle, flute, bodhran\nFormer members\nTom MacKenzie - vocals, hammered dulcimer, guitar, banjo, keyboards, ukulele\n(D) Mike Lussen - vocals, banjo, guitar, bouzouki, bodhran\nBruce Morgan - vocals, guitar, mandolin, concertina\n(D) Chip Chase - vocals, fiddle, guitar, mandolin, banjo, bodhran\n(D) Rusty Jacobs - vocals, guitar, tin whistle\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== 1983 - Where Am I To Go? ===\nSanty Anno\nWild Mountain Thyme\nThe Road To Boston\nWhere Am I To Go?\nPanxty Fanny Poswers\nBlow Ye Winds\nThree Pounds Ten\nThe Blarney Pilgrim\nThe Irish Question\nSally In The Garden\nNo Mans Land\nSummertime - The Rights Of Man\n\n\n=== 1995 - Side By Each ===\nIrish Rain\nLazy\nClam Flats / Oyster River / The Bridge / Mud Walk\nSpotted Pony / Sugar Hill\nShe Was\nWayfaring Stranger\nRoll the Old Chariot / Green Willis\nHome Sweet Home\nApril Wood\nThree Fishers\nPetticoat Whalers / Nantucket Sleigh Ride\nChilly Winds\nThe Trip\nDaughters and Sons\n\n\n=== 1995 - Journey Home ===\nPaddy's Green Shamrock Shore\nBoyne Water\nBy The Hush\nRoll Highway\nJohnny Jump Up\nTake Your Pay\nFoolish Questions\nTalcahuano Girls\nJenny-Lynne\nGhost of Gloucester's Fleet\nMatthew 18:3\nMist Covered Mountains\nPull Down Your Vest\nGoin' Away\n\n\n=== 1999 - The Wood's Tea Co. - Live! ===\nDaughters & Sons\nThe Wild Rover\nBanks of Newfoundland\nWee Wee\nJenny Glenn\nThe Scotsman's Kilt\nThe Folker\n'Aargh!'\nHere I Am\nBlarney Pilgrim / Morpeth Rant\nRoll the Old Chariots\nThe Dutchman\nFoolish Questions\nAlberta Bound\nThe Cat Came Back\nFinnegan's Wake\nSomewhere Over the Rainbow\nThere Were Roses\nSandy River Bell / Soldiers Joy\n\n\n=== 2001 - This Side of the Sea ===\nHaul Away Joe\nSt. Patrick's Day in America\nThe Fireman\nUnst Wedding March\nThe High Cost of Living\nThis Side of the Sea\nThe Morning Comes Early\nFarewell\nThe Bullgine\nShe Loves the Rain\nLittle Birdie\nOde to New Jersey\nPlanxty Fanny Powers\nBedford Harbor\nLift & Tow\n\n\n=== 2003 - Standing Room Only ===\nLonesome Traveller\nThe Country Life\nMorning on the Clam Flats / Oyster River\nGirl of My Dreams\nInspirational Moment\nRH Intro\nRobin Hood (written by first-graders in Burlington, Vermont)\nOlympic Audience Judging\nLament for Henriette / St. Anne's Reel / Soldier's Joy\nSweet Appreciation\n18 Again\nWhere Am I To Go\nSantuario\nRock / O'Keef's Slide / Lord of The Dance\nThe Schooner I'm Alone\nDon't Pet the Dog\nGive Me Just a Little More Time\nThis Land is Your Land\nSpeed The Plow / Mason's Apron / Devil's Dream\nRolling Home\n\n\n=== 2003 - An Evening With Woods Tea Company (DVD) ===\nWas aired on PBS a number of times.\n\n\n=== 2007 - The Passage ===\nThe Passage / Whistle Jump\nAll The Hard Days Are Gone\nDecember's Child\nSink The Cheerio\nMy Monday\nBefore They Close The Minstrel Show\nThe Coal Town Road\nLovell the Robber\nThe Old Dun Cow\nFor Rusty\nReuben James\nRound The Bend\nGin Ye Marry Me or Birnie Bouzle\nOn Board the Saratoga\nGod Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen / O'Carolyn Tune\nThe Waterfall\n\n\n=== 2009 - A Lively Evening with The Woods Tea Co. ===\nThis album was released on February 20, 2009, as a DVD and CD combo.\n\nWhere Am I To Go?\nThe Old Dun Cow / Star of Munster / Temperance Reel\nThe Remember Song\nDown From Canada\nThe Wild Rover\nGlencoe Schottische / Lord Of The Dance\nLittle Birdie\nSink The Cheerio\nGhost Of Pekin Brook\nThe High Cost of Living\nHandsome Patrick\nSandy River Belle / Soldier's Joy\nOld Man\nThis Little Light Of Mine\nRolling Home\nPatti's Dance\n\n\n=== 2010 - 10 For 10 ===\nThis album was released at various times during 2010 for $10, and it has 10 songs on it, hence the name.

    "text": "Kate McGarrigle (February 6, 1946 – January 18, 2010) and Anna McGarrigle (born December 4, 1944) were a duo of Canadian singer-songwriters (and sisters) from Quebec, who performed until Kate's death on January 18, 2010.\n\n\n== Music career ==\nIn the 1960s, in Montreal, while Kate was studying chemical engineering at McGill University and Anna art at the École des beaux-arts de Montréal, they began performing in public and writing their own songs. From 1963 to 1967 they teamed up with Jack Nissenson and Peter Weldon to form the folk group Mountain City Four.\nTheir songs have been covered by a variety of artists including Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris, Judy Collins, and others. These covers led to the McGarrigles getting their first recording contract in 1974. They released their eponymous debut album in 1976, and created nine more albums through 2008.\nAlthough associated with Quebec's anglophone community, they also recorded and performed many songs in French. Two of their albums, Entre la jeunesse et la sagesse and La vache qui pleure, are entirely in French.\nTheir version of Wade Hemsworth's song, \"The Log Driver's Waltz\" grew famous as the soundtrack for a 1979 animated film directed by John Weldon at Canada's National Film Board. They provided backing vocals on Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds's 2001 album No More Shall We Part.\nThey continued to write, record and perform music into the 21st century, with assorted accompanying artists including Gerry Conway, Pat Donaldson, Ken Pearson, Michel Pépin, Chaim Tannenbaum and Joel Zifkin.\n\n\n== Personal lives ==\nAnna and Kate McGarrigle were born in Montreal of mixed Irish- and French-Canadian background. They grew up in Saint-Sauveur, where they learned piano from nuns. In 1971 Kate married the singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III. Their children, Rufus and Martha, are also both singers. The two divorced in 1976. Kate McGarrigle died in 2010, aged 63, of sarcoma, a rare form of cancer.\nAnna McGarrigle was married to Canadian journalist and author Dane Lanken until his death on March 3, 2023. The couple had two children, Lily Lanken and Sylvan Lanken, and lived in North Glengarry, Ontario, just west of the Quebec border. Dane appeared as a vocalist on several of the sisters' albums and in 2007 wrote their career biography. Another sister, Jane McGarrigle (born April 26, 1941), is a film and television composer who acted as business manager for Kate and Anna, and also wrote and performed several songs with the duo.: 114 \n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nThey were appointed Members of the Order of Canada in 1993 and received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award in 2004. On November 22, 2006, they received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2006 SOCAN Awards in Toronto.\nThey received the 2010 Mojo Roots Award, which was presented by Emmylou Harris. The award was accepted by Anna together with Kate's children Rufus and Martha Wainwright, as Kate had died early that year on January 18.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nKate & Anna McGarrigle (1976) - Sweden #27\nDancer with Bruised Knees (1977) - U.K. #35, Canada #43\nPronto Monto (1978)\nEntre la jeunesse et la sagesse (1980) – also known by the title French Record\nLove Over and Over  (1982)\nHeartbeats Accelerating (1990) - Canada #61\nMatapédia (1996) Canada #49; winner of 1997 Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year – Group)\nThe McGarrigle Hour (1998) – winner of 1999 Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year – Group)\nLa vache qui pleure (2003)\nThe McGarrigle Christmas Hour (2005)\nODDiTTiES (2010)\nTell My Sister (2011)\nSing Me the Songs: Celebrating the Works of Kate McGarrigle (2013)\nToronto May '82 (unofficial) (2016)\nTant Le Monde: Live in Bremen, Germany, 2005 (2022)\n\n\n=== With other artists ===\nAlbum II by Loudon Wainwright (1971), Kate McGarrigle - vocals on \"Old Paint\"\nAttempted Mustache by Loudon Wainwright, Kate McGarrigle banjo and vocals.\nWaitress in a Donut Shop by Maria Muldaur (1974) – \"Cool River\", \"Travelin' Shoes (Kate only)\"\nPrisoner in Disguise by Linda Ronstadt (1975) – \"You Tell Me That I'm Falling Down\"\nUnrequited by Loudon Wainwright, Kate & Anna McGarrigle, vocals.\nSunnyvista by Richard and Linda Thompson (1979) – \"You're Gonna Need Somebody\", \"Sisters\", \"Traces of My Love\"\nBluebird by Emmylou Harris (1989) – \"Love Is\"\nSongs of the Civil War (1991) – \"Was My Brother in the Battle?\", \"Better Times Are Coming\", \"Hard Times Come Again No More\"\nThe Bells of Dublin (1991) – \"Il Est Né/Ca Berger\" with The Chieftains\n 'Til Their Eyes Shine (The Lullaby Album) (1992) – \"Lullaby For A Doll\"\nHistory by Loudon Wainwright, Kate & Anna McGarrigle, vocals.\nWrecking Ball by Emmylou Harris (1995) – \"Going Back To Harlan\", \"Waltz Across Texas Tonight\"\nLive at the World Cafe: Volume 9 (1999) – \"DJ Serenade\"\nWestern Wall: The Tucson Sessions by Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt (1999) – \"All I left behind you\", \"1917\", \"Sisters of mercy\"\nRed Dirt Girl by Emmylou Harris (2000) – \"J'Ai Fait Tout\" (Kate only, instrumentals), \"Boy From Tupelo\" (Kate only, vocals)\nNo More Shall We Part by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (2001)\nStumble into Grace by Emmylou Harris (2003) – \"I Will Dream\", \"Little Bird\", \"O Evangeline\", \"Cup of kindness\" (Kate only)\nMartha Wainwright by Martha Wainwright, Kate McGarrigle – banjo (track 3), piano (track 6).\nLeonard Cohen: I'm Your Man Soundtrack (2006) – \"Winter Lady\" (with Martha Wainwright)\nAll I Intended to Be by Emmylou Harris (2008) – \"Moon Song\", \"Sailing 'Round The Room\", \"How She Could Sing the Wildwood Flower\"\nI Know You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too by Martha Wainwright, Anna McGarrigle – keyboard, synths and background vocals (12), Kate McGarrigle – hand claps (2), Wurlitzer (12), backing vocals (12)\nNorthern Songs: Canada's Best and Brightest (2008) – \"Entre Lajeunesse et la Sagesse\"\nEasy Come, Easy Go by Marianne Faithfull (2008) – Kate & Anna McGarrigle vocals on \"Flandyke Shore\"\nRing Them Bells by Joan Baez – \"Willie Moore\" (Traditional) Baez, Kate, and Anna McGarrigle vocals; Baez guitar, Kate McGarrigle banjo, Anna McGarrigle accordion.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\nThe McGarrigle Hour (1999) – with Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, Loudon Wainwright, Chaim Tannenbaum, Jane McGarrigle, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and Lily Lanken).\n2009 – A Not So Silent Night (2009) – with Rufus and Martha Wainwright.\n\n\n=== Film work ===\nThe Log Driver's Waltz (1979) - an NFB animated short of the Wade Hemsworth song directed by John Weldon\nThe sisters were the subject of an eponymous documentary film directed by Caroline Leaf.

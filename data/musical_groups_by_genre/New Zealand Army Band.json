    "text": "The New Zealand Army Band (Māori: Puoro Puoro Ngāti Tūmatauenga) is a brass band that primarily provides musical support for the New Zealand Army at all state and ceremonial occasions. It was founded in 1964 by Captain (later Major) James Donald Carson (1934–2008) of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment.\nIt is based out of Burnham Camp, which is the largest army base on the South Island. Presently, the New Zealand Army Band and the Officer Cadet School are the only units of the New Zealand Army that employ scarlet tunics as part of their full dress uniforms. The Campaign hat is also used as headgear for the band. 35-members strong, it includes a parade band, a concert band as well as rhythm sections and a vocalist.\nThe band sports an official newsletter entitled Espirit De Corps that generally publishes two articles a year.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was founded in 1964 by Captain (later Major) James Donald Carson (1934–2008) of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment. At the time of its establishment, the number of army bands was reduced to seven, with the intention being that New Zealand Army Band would compensate that with a central band to represent the branch at all events. Its conception was based around the fact that it was the first professional band in the New Zealand Military Forces. From 1965–1988, members of the Army Band were posted on a two-year cycle with the Band of the 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, based originally at Terendak Camp in Malaysia. These biannual postings continued until December 1988, when the regimental band was disestablished and members returned to the New Zealand Army Band. In 2012, it was one of three bands spared in the government cutback on military bands.\n\n\n== Marching displays ==\nNoted military tattoos has had the band travelling to Bremen, Germany; Basel, Switzerland; Nanchang, China; Wonju, South Korea and Edinburgh, Scotland. During its visit to Scotland in 2018 for the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, the band was presented with the Pooley Sword after it was considered to be the greatest act of that year's show by other bands and the audience. The band's first performance was a concert in Auckland in 1964. The Army Band celebrated its 20th anniversary in 1984 with an American-style Big Band march down Queen Street. In August 1979, the band performed at the wedding services for their director Roger C. Carter.\nThe drum major of the band uses a tewhatewha, a long-handled Māori club weapon in the shape of an axe, instead of a mace to give direction and keep time. More recently, a Haka display group was attached to the band.\n\n\n=== Small ensembles ===\nThe Swing Band\nDance Band\nJazz Combo\nBrass Quintet\nThe Bavarian Band\n\n\n== Quick marches ==\n\n\n== Leadership ==\nThe current senior appointments within the band are:\n\nDirector of Music – Major Graham Hickman DSD, FTCL, LTCL(T), Dip Man, Dip Applied Man, AIRMTNZ.\nBandmaster – Staff Sergeant Nick Johnson MA, PGCE, LRSM, LTCL, ALCM.\nDrum Major – Staff Sergeant Kevin Hickman\nSenior Instructor, School Of Music – Staff Sergeant Philip Johnston FTCL.\nSenior Staff Composer/Arranger - Sergeant Riwai Hina\n\n\n== Honours ==\nMajor James Donald Carson was named in the 1974 Queen's Birthday Honours, where he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, and in 1977 he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. \nThe longest serving member of the band, WO1 Graeme Alexander Bremner (enlisted in 1965) was awarded the New Zealand Distinguished Service Decoration in the 2014 New Year Honours. \nIn 2017, Major Graham Ross Hickman of the band was similarly awarded in the 2017 New Year Honours, for services to the New Zealand Defence Force and brass bands.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe band has released the following CDs:\n\nOn Parade (1974)\nEntertainers Supreme (1976)\nBrass To Go (1977)\nBrass On The March (1979)\nChips And Other Tasty Goodies (1981)\nRoyal Wedding (1981) - AUS #49\nConflict - Tunes Of Glory (1981)\nChameleon (1999)\nAn Album Of Two Halves (2001)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of military units based in or affiliated with the South Island\nBand of the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery\nRoyal New Zealand Air Force Band\nRoyal New Zealand Navy Band\nNelson Garrison Band\n\n\n== References =="

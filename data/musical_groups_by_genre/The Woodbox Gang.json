    "text": "The Woodbox Gang is a band formerly based in Herod, Illinois, then out of Makanda, Illinois. They play an eclectic style of bluegrass music labeled by some as \"insurgent Americana,\" \"jug-punk,\" \"y'allternative,\" and \"funk-a-billy,\" though they prefer the terms \"caustic acoustic\" and \"trashcan Americana\" (also the name of one of their albums).\nThe band originated as the trio of dobro player Brad Bolin and the brothers Hugh (guitar, kazoo, and vocals) and Brian (bass) DeNeal in 1999. Bolin soon left the band, but rejoined in 2000 along with Alex Kirt (assorted jug percussion, washboard, banjo, kazoo, harmonica, didgeridoo, slide resonator guitar, drum, vocals, stompboard, and gutbucket); however, Bolin left the band a second time. They were later joined by Greg Edwards (bass), Ratliff Dean Thiebaud (guitar and vocals), and  Dan Goett (banjo, mandolin, dobro, guitar).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n A Caustic Acoustic Cacophony (2001)\nTrashcan Americana (2001)\nWormwood (2002)\nShowdown (2002)\nBorn With A Tail (2003)\nI've Killed Men (2003)\nLive at Schubas 06/09/2004 (2004)\nLive at Hangar 9 (2005)\nDrunk as Dragons (2006)\nDrunk as Dragons: Fortified Edition (2008)\nWhite Trash Voodoo (2009)\nGlorious Scars (2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Artist details for The Woodbox Gang\".

    "text": "Shinee ( SHY-nee; Korean: 샤이니, romanized: Syaini; Japanese: シャイニー, romanized: Shainī; stylized as SHINee) is a South Korean boy band formed by SM Entertainment in 2008. The group originally consisted of five members: Onew, Key, Minho, Taemin, and Jonghyun, until the latter died in 2017. The group's musical impact in their native country has earned them numerous accolades and the title \"Princes of K-pop\".\nShinee debuted in May 2008 with their first extended play (EP), Replay, fronted by the single of the same name. The group gained attention for starting a fashion trend amongst students, which the media dubbed the \"Shinee Trend\". In August 2008, the group released their first Korean studio album, The Shinee World, which won Newcomer Album of the Year at the 23rd Golden Disc Awards. Shinee further consolidated their popularity on the South Korean music scene with follow-up singles \"Ring Ding Dong\" and \"Lucifer\". \"Ring Ding Dong\" charted on top of several Korean music charts and gained popularity all over Asia. \"Lucifer\" was nominated for the Best Dance Performance Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards in 2010 for its outstanding choreography. In 2012, the group released Sherlock, which became the fifth best-selling album of the year with over 180,000 copies sold. Subsequent albums included The Misconceptions of Us (2013), Odd (2015), 1 of 1 (2016), The Story of Light (2018), Don't Call Me (2021), and Hard (2023). The group has also been included in the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 twice (2014, 2016).\nIn mid-2011, Shinee signed with EMI Music Japan to venture into the Japanese music scene. Their Japanese version of their single \"Replay\" sold over 100,000 copies, the highest number of sales for a Japanese debut single recorded by Oricon for a South Korean group at the time. It was followed by their first Japanese studio album, The First, on December 7, 2011 – both were certified Gold by RIAJ for selling over 100,000 copies. In 2011, the group also held their Japan Debut Premium Reception at Abbey Road Studios in London, making them the first Asian artists to perform there. Two years later, they released their second Japanese album Boys Meet U (2013), followed by I'm Your Boy (2014), D×D×D (2016), and Five (2017).\nShinee is considered to be one of the best live vocal groups in K-pop and is known for their highly synchronized and complex dance routines, having been awarded the Best Dance Performance Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards three times in a row for their dance performances to \"Sherlock (Clue + Note)\", \"Dream Girl\" and \"View\".

The group's Korean name, Shinee, is a new coined word and is explained as a combination of shine, meaning light, and the suffix ee, therefore meaning \"one who receives the light\". On May 22, 2008, the group's first EP, Replay, was released, which debuted at number ten on the South Korean music charts and peaked at number eight, selling 17,957 copies in the first half of 2008.

Their style has created a fashion trend amongst students which the media dubbed the \"Shinee Trend\". The group's \"boyish charm\" was an important factor in Shinee gaining fans. With the release of 2009, Year of Us, Shinee's style became more mature, though still maintaining Shinee's unique image. Furthermore, instead of working with famous artists and photographers, SM Entertainment's Visual and Art Directing department usually works with up-and-coming talents with new ideas for Shinee's concepts. When Shinee debuted in 2008 with \"Replay\", it was not only their music which gained attention but also their colorful style – but even four years later, in 2012, Shinee maintained their colorful concept for Sherlock. Ha stated in an interview with The Korea Times: \"Much has evolved over the years, since I change their styles to reflect their music. The feel from their debut single still exists, mixing the overground  [sic] with the underground, haute couture with street fashion ... but it is very modern, like Shinee.\"\n\n\n=== Vocals and choreography ===\nShinee are acknowledged for their \"innovative approach to music and peerless choreography\" and are considered some of the best live vocalists and dancers in Korean pop. They are known for their good vocal performances and complex choreographies, as well as a unique style of music that sets them apart from other K-pop artists. At SM Entertainment's showcase in New York in October 2011, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times summarized them as \"the most ambitious\" of the evening and also complimented the group's strong vocal performance. Furthermore, he stated: \"Their music, especially \"Replay\", \"Ring Ding Dong\" and \"Juliette\", felt the riskiest, even if it only slightly tweaked that polyglot K-pop formula\". Kim Joo-hyun of Beff Report considers Shinee's greatest strength the dismantling of the boundaries between the role of main vocal and subvocal. He positively emphasised the harmony between the two main vocals, Onew and Jonghyun, saying they sing with an aesthetic of \"contrast\", meaning they can't be separated from each other; on the contrary, they actually suit each other when brought together. He also praised the vocal development of Taemin, the youngest member in the group. Jakob Dorof of the monthly British style magazine Dazed described Shinee as possessing \"technicolor visuals\", \"choreography as coordinated as ballet\", and \"wildly adventurous hit songs\", stating they are a group that embodies the harmony of these qualities better than anyone else. Tamar Herman of Paste described Shinee as one of K-pop's most popular dance groups, \"with cutting edge dance moves that are just as technically creative as the songs they've performed\".\nShinee have worked with top choreographers such as Rino Nakasone, who choreographed Shinee's early songs like \"Replay\" and \"Love Like Oxygen\" in 2008, \"Juliette\" in 2009, and the group's hit single \"Lucifer\" in 2010, which was nominated for the Best Dance Performance at the Mnet Asian Music Awards in 2010. Misha Gabriel choreographed the songs \"Amigo\" (2008) and \"Ring Ding Dong\" (2009). Tony Testa worked on Shinee's later hit songs like \"Sherlock (Clue + Note)\" (2012) and \"Dream Girl\" (2013), which are characterized by a unique and distinctive style, while Ian Eastwood worked on \"View\" (2015) – breaking away from the group's usual powerful and precise choreography and working instead with a groove style that showcases the teamwork of the group. All three songs were awarded with the Best Dance Performance Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards: in 2012, 2013, and 2015.\n\n\n=== Musical style and themes ===\n\nThe predominant musical genre of the group is contemporary R&B. The group's early singles like \"Replay\" and \"Lucifer\" were influenced by R&B and dance pop, while tracks such as \"Get Down\" and \"JoJo\" explored other musical styles such as hip-hop and dance. Shinee's third album is significantly influenced by funk rock, electronic music and rock. Billboard columnist Jeff Benjamin compared Shinee's songs like \"Punch Drunk Love\" and \"Aside\" to the sounds of Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, while tracks like \"Beautiful\" and \"Runaway\" combine \"unique electronic production elements over sugary boy band harmonies to create year-round pop music\".\nShinee as a group is known for their experimental sound and ability to execute a wide range of genres. An example of this is the group's fifth extended play, Everybody, whose title song is classified under the complextro genre. Jakob Dorof of Tiny Mix Tapes stated that \"Everybody is proof positive that, even in a culture industry designed to minimize the role of real musicianship, talent will find its way to the top.\" He also remarked that \"Close the Door\" highlights the experimental and versatile nature of Shinee's music which frequently charts into unfamiliar territories.\nWith the release of their fourth Korean album, Odd, Shinee returned to their old sound while experimenting with new genres like deep house. According to Key, Odd marked the first time the group had direct involvement in the album production process, including the decision over picking the lead single as well as the album's concept. The costumes were based on Key's ideas – a vintage, old-school [aesthetic], during a time when other groups mostly wore uniforms. The album spanned a variety of styles including the two singles – the deep house \"View\" and Rocky Horror-inspired funk track \"Married to the Music\". Alexis Hodoyan-Gastelum of MTV praised the lead single, \"View\", describing it as a \"great, laid back summer jam\" even though \"the song fools us into thinking it's an uptempo ballad before reaching its techno peak at the chorus.\" Jeff Benjamin, on the other hand, praised \"Odd Eye\", which is written and composed by member Jonghyun. Benjamin states the group's \"return to the R&B side of Shinee with feathery vocals, tight harmonies and member Onew's falsetto howls acting a centerpiece to this grooving opener\" but he also adds, \"despite initially debuting with a R&B sound, Shinee is arguably most exciting when experimenting\".\n\n\n== Endorsements ==\nEarly in their career, Shinee were endorsers for several brands, such as the cosmetic brand Nana's B and the sports brand Reebok. Later, they endorsed the clothing brand Maypole as well as the popular Korean cosmetic brands Etude House and The Saem. In 2012, Etude House's Lash Pump 3-Step Volume-Cara, a PC-based and mobile micro-site featuring \"doll eyelashes\" main model Sandara Park and Shinee – appearing as puppets – was awarded first place in the Mobile Marketing and Product Promotions categories at the 9th Web Awards Korea. The group was also part of the popular Korean comic The Blade of the Phantom Master and webtoon series ENT. Furthermore, the group endorsed the sports brand Skechers and collaborated with Naver and Skechers for T-shirts and caps designed by the group members. In March 2023, K-beauty brand Dr.G appointed Shinee as their global ambassador in hopes of expanding the brand's global market with their strong fan base both in Korea and abroad.\nCompanies whose products are promoted by the Shinee label often see increased revenue; for example, \"Shinee's Sparkling Water\", a carbonated bottled water sold by E-mart, boasted a combined sales of 67 million won over a one-month period.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Publications ==\nChildren of the Sun: Onew, Key, Taemin of Shinee in Barcelona, Woongjin Think Big Co., Ltd (September 12, 2011) ISBN 8901136058\nShinee Surprise Vacation – Travel Note, SM Entertainment (May 27, 2013), ISBN 8996955434\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nshinee.smtown.com (2020 archive)\nShinee at AllMusic"

Seeing how most models, with being in the public eye, were focused on their image and how they portrayed themselves as being larger than life. With most buying into their own hyped up personas, and developing an ego that matched who they had convinced themselves that they were.\n\n\n== Line-up ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nMarc Massive – lyrics, vocals (1996–2022, 2024–present)\nOliver Frost – percussion (2004–2022, 2024–present)\nLloyd Price  – keyboards, programming, music (2015–2017, 2021–2022, 2024–present)\nPorl Young – Guitar, programming, music (2022, 2024–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nAndy J Thirwall – keyboards, programming, music (1996–2000)\nStuart 'Barnaby' Moffatt – bass (1996–1997)\nDan Black – guitar (1996–1997)\nEddie Orange Dasher (Steady) – keyboards, guitar (2002–2005)\nDean Bright – keyboards (2002–2005)\nScot Collins – keyboards, programming, music (2015–2021)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2006: Nite Klub Skewl\n2017: Beautiful Suicide\n2019: Church for the Malfunctioned\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n2009: Master & Servant\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n2014: Low Life\n2015: Noise in the Machine\n2018: Nothing But A Void\n2022: The New Normal\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1997: \"You Think You're a Man!\" (Divine cover)\n1999: \"Planet Earth\" (Duran Duran cover)\n2002: \"My Heart Goes Bang (Get Me to the Doctor)\" (vs. Miss Dusty 'O') (Dead or Alive cover)\n2009: \"Sex Drive\" (Dead or Alive cover) (iTunes digital single)\n2011: \"I Idolize You\"\n2012: \"Eighth Day (Hazel O'Connor cover)\"\n2013: \"Dead Silence\" (Lia Organa & Electric Prince feat.

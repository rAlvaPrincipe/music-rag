The band also includes drummer Mike Higgins.\n\n\n== History ==\nZott and Epstein met each other while playing in other Detroit music projects. They formed Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. in late 2009, and began recording in Zott's basement in Royal Oak, Michigan with few intentions of reaching the public. Their original name, derived from NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr., was suggested to the pair as a joke. In 2013 Zott stated, \"The name for us was just a way to identify our crazy new project that had no limitations. People have no idea how we are going to sound, and so it gives them a reason to actually take some time to listen to the music.\" About 2011, the band emailed Dale Earnhardt Jr. to assure him they were not making fun of him; he responded that Jimmie Johnson had already told him about them, he was flattered, and they would \"not hear from any lawyers\".\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: Horsepower (EP) and It's A Corporate World ===\nIn July 2010, the band released Horsepower EP via Quite Scientific Records.

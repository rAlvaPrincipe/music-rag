    "text": "Johnnys (ジャニーズ, Janīzu) were a Japanese boy band created by Johnny Kitagawa before the formation of the Japanese talent agency Johnny & Associates.\nThe group was formed in April 1962 and lasted until November 20, 1967. They are considered one of the first of Japan's idol groups. Johnnys is also an abbreviation for \"Johnny's Jimusho\" and also for the talents signed to the agency. For the sake of convenience in Japan, the group is often called \"First Generation Johnny's\" or \"Founding Johnnys\". For those considered to be \"bishōnen\" the term \"Johnnys Type\" is used. The word, despite referring to one male's looks, is not to be mistaken for the word \"Ikemen\".\nTheir debut single \"Wakai Namida\" (1964) was composed by Hachidai Nakamura with the lyrics by Rokusuke Ei. Nakamura and Ei formerly made the music and lyric of Kyu Sakamoto's U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"Sukiyaki.\" On December 31, 1965, Johnnys sang the song \"Mack the Knife\" in the 16th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen at the Tokyo Takarazuka Theater.\nAlthough little known in the U.S., they were the first group to record the hit song \"Never My Love\" by the Association.\n\n\n== Members ==\nHiromi Maie (真家 ひろみ, Hiromi Maie) (November 1, 1946 - March 6, 2000)\nOsami Iino (飯野 おさみ, Iino Osami) (born August 23, 1946)\nRyo Nakatani (中谷 良, Nakatani Ryō) (born September 18, 1947)\nTeruhiko Aoi (青井 輝彦, Aoi Teruhiko) (born January 10, 1948)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nWakai Namida (Young Tears)\nWakai Yoru (Young Night)\nHonō no Kaabu (Curved Flame)\nGirl Happy\nEikō no March (Glorious March)\nKimi ga Wakamono Nara (You are a Young Man)\nNaiteita Jenny (Crying Jenny)\nBatman * used as the theme song for the Japanese airing of the television series Batman\nŌi Waai Chichichi\nKiri no Yoru no Aishuu (The Sorrow of the Night's Fog)\nTokei wo Tomete (Clock's Stopped)\nTaiyō no Aitsu (Guy of the Sun)\nItsuka Dokoka de (Someday, anywhere)\nWakai Nihon no Uta (Song of Japan's Youth)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nJyaniizu to Amerika Ryokou ~ Jyaniizu Shou Jikkyou Rokuon (Johnnys and an American Journey ~ Johnnys Real Recording~)\n\n\n== References =="

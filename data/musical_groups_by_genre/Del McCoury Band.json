    "text": "The Del McCoury Band is a Grammy award-winning American bluegrass band.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally the band was called Del McCoury and the Dixie Pals with Del on guitar and his brother Jerry on bass. The band went through a number of changes in personnel until the 1980s when the band solidified its line-up, adding McCoury's sons, Ronnie and Robbie on mandolin and banjo, respectively. In 1988, the \"Dixie Pals\" name was dropped in favor of the current name. Fiddler Tad Marks and bass player Mike Brantley joined in the early 1990s while the band became a national touring act. The addition of fiddler Jason Carter and bassist Mike Bub in 1992 created a lineup that was unchanged for 13 years. Bub left the band in 2005 and was replaced by Alan Bartram.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nIn 1999 the Del McCoury band was named \"Entertainer of the Year\" at the International Bluegrass Music Awards.\nIn 2004 they were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album for It's Just the Night, and in 2006 they won that category for The Company We Keep.\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nThe band recorded with Steve Earle on \"I Still Carry You Around\" on his 1997 album El Corazón.

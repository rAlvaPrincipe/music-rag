    "text": "Baskery is a Swedish alternative Americana folk rock band, comprising the three sisters Greta, Stella and Sunniva Bondesson.  The band have released five studio albums.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed in 2007 as an offshoot of The Slaptones, who featured their father Janåke Bondesson on drums, released two albums (Simplify, 2003, and Amplify, 2004) and toured the United States with The Brian Setzer Orchestra.\nBaskery released an EP, One Horse Down, in 2007 on Veranda Independent Records. Their first album, Fall Among Thieves, was recorded with producer Lasse Mårtén using no overdubs and mainly first or second takes, with the aim of capturing as much energy as possible.  It was released in Sweden in May 2008; in Norway, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy in autumn 2008; and in the UK in January 2009.  In 2008 the group toured and played festivals in the United States, Canada, France, Ireland, Denmark and Norway, and toured the UK supporting Seth Lakeman in late 2008.\nIn 2012 Baskery played gigs throughout the United States and Europe including festivals such as Beautiful Days (festival) and Shrewsbury Folk Festival before heading into the studio in Berlin to start work on recording their third album.\n2013 saw the group touring Germany supporting Ina Müller before embarking on their own US tour playing across the country, including The Birchmere in Virginia with Johnny Winter, Four Corners Folk Festival in Colorado and Sisters Folk Festival in Oregon.\nLittle Wild Life, the third studio album, was released in Sweden in October 2013 before a Europe-wide release in early 2014.\nIn 2014 the sisters moved from Europe to the US and were based in Nashville, TN until they landed a record deal with Warner Bros. in September 2014, then relocated to Los Angeles, CA. \nBaskery opened up for Robbie Williams on his \"Let Me Entertain You Tour\" in early 2015 and supported Brandi Carlile later the same year.\n\n2016 / 2017 saw Baskery tour the length and breadth of the US including playing at Bottle Rock, Arroyo Seco, Newport Folk Festival, Bonnaroo, SXSW & Utopia Fest and supporting Gary Clark Jr. on his The Story of Sonny Boy Slim Tour.\nSeveral singles were released in this period. Love in L.A. (2016) and then Cheerless Leaders, Cruel Companion and Sick Of The Remedy (2017).\nIn 2018 Baskery embarked on a busy touring schedule across the US, Sweden, Spain, Denmark, Finland and England, opening for Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real on his German Tour.\nThe band's fourth studio album Coyote & Sirens was released in 2018 recorded at Glenwood Studios in Burbank, Los Angeles with Andrew Dawson (record producer).\nIn 2020 the band released the single The Fall. \n2021 the band released the single Rock 'n' Roll on 7 inch single and as a digital download. For the vinyl release the single was backed with a cover of the Neil Young track Old Man. \n2022 saw Baskery touring extensively including playing Glastonbury Festival for its much welcome return after a two-year hiatus. A CD only release was issued by the band entitled Most Wanted Vol.1 - this was their own version of a bootleg, recreating the live experience as well as some key studio recordings. It was only available through the band's website.  \nBaskery's fifth studio album 'V: End of the Bloodline' was released in October 2023 to excellent reviews. Two digital only singles were released to accompany the LP - Wolf Hook and Way With Lovers.\n2024 saw Baskery appearing at several festivals including a return to Glastonbury Festival. \nIn 2024 Baskery teased a new LP of Neil Young covers by releasing the singles Sugar Mountain and Cowgirl In The Sand.

Colin Irwin of Mojo described them as \"absurdly wonderful...[they] do their own thing with a glee which, coupled with no little virtuosity and runaway vivaciousness, is irresistible\".\n\n\n== Personal Lives ==\nAll members of Baskery are Vegan and are passionate about animal welfare and protecting the environment.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nGreta Bondesson: Guitar banjo / guitars, drums, harmonica, vocals\nStella Bondesson: Double bass, electric bass, vocals\nSunniva Bondesson: Acoustic/electric guitars, cello, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nOne Horse Down (Veranda Independent Records, 2007)\nLeafland Avenue' (Mother Tarantula Records, 2020)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nLove In L.A.

    "text": "H.W.A. (an initialism of Hoez With Attitude) is an American all-female hip hop trio composed of Jazz, Diva and Baby Girl; Diva was later on replaced by Go-Di. They were active between 1989 and 1994, and reformed in April 2012. Their name is a reference to another Hip Hop / Gangsta rap group called N.W.A\n\n\n== History ==\nThe three members came together in 1989, founded and funded by Chicago street legend Keith \"KP\" Presley, and soon secured an independent label from Drive-By Records to record their first album Livin in a hoe house. The album was not a huge success, only making it to #38 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, but the group became known for its sexually explicit lyrics and they were soon signed to Eazy-E's Ruthless Records. Their second album, Az Much Ass Azz U Want, was even less of a success, briefly reaching #71 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. They also made a cameo appearance in Eazy-E's \"diss\" song to Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, \"Real Muthaphuckkin G's\".\nIn 1993, H.W.A. released a single called \"All That (Juzt a Little Action\", which received a very generous amount of airtime due to the involvement of Eazy-E.\nIn 1994, H.W.A. released a remix album called I Ain't No Lady. Afterwards, H.W.A disbanded.\nIn April 2012, according to Jazz, H.W.A. reformed.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWynn, Ron. Biography of H.W.A. at AllMusic.

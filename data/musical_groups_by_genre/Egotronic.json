    "text": "Egotronic is a German electropunk band from Berlin formed in 2000. It is well known for its Antideutsch political views.\n\n\n== Band history ==\nAfter a couple of projects released through self-publishing, Egotronic joined the Hamburg record label Audiolith Records in 2005, whereon their first single Nein nein/Luxus (No no/luxury) got released. The band went on a tour through Russia (accompanied by the artist Plemo) during the same year. In 2006, Egotronic released their first album Die richtige Einstellung (The right attitude). The second album, Lustprinzip (Pleasure principle) followed in 2007, the third one in 2008. Its fourth album, called Ausflug mit Freunden (Excursion with friends), on which almost every song is a cooperation with friends of Egotronic, was released on 30 April 2010. Their fifth album Macht keinen Lärm (Don't be noisy) is heavily influenced by classic punk music, making heavy use of guitars, and  pop music, featuring more melodic and less trashy songs compared to earlier albums.\n\n\n== Genre ==\nIn their style, the band combines the attitude and the sociocritical pretensions of punk rock with elements from Electronic music and  Synthpop. Egotronic closely cooperates with other Audiolith bands, such as Frittenbude or Saalschutz, which also show stylistic  similarities. One of Egotronic's characteristics is the extensive use of Commodore 64 and Atari sounds, which are, however, produced on contemporary computers. Especially sounds that are well-known from classic computer games are often used in the songs; even the music videos are reminiscent of those old computer games.\n\n\n== Political activism ==\nEgotronic participates in the initiative I Can't Relax in Deutschland, which is an organization of artists, who criticize German patriotism and an increasing nationalization of pop culture. In its lyrics, Egotronic often communicates political messages, for example on the debates on Leitkultur or Jürgen Möllemann. In the song Nicht nur Raver (Not just ravers), Egotronic takes a stand in the discussion on the Riot of Rostock-Lichtenhagen and the Mügeln mob attack. Egotronic's anti-German attitude is subject to criticism, even within the left scene. Public attention was drawn to the band for its Rave-style version of the English football song Ten German Bombers, which got released on the occasion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006. The leftist nationwide newspaper taz reported on the song.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSingles:\n\n2005 Nein Nein/Luxus\n2007 Lustprinzip\n2008 Kotzen\n2009 Es muß stets hell für Gottes Auge sein\n2010 Was soll's\n2010 Ich kanns nicht sagen (feat.

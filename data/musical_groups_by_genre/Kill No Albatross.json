    "text": "Kill No Albatross (formerly Gatling) was a Canadian band formed by Alexander Sallas and Alex Crosty in November 2007 in Burlington, Ontario. Their music is associated with progressive metal and alternative rock, though there are ambient, post-hardcore, and jazz influences as well. The band is noted for having two songs in the Rock Band video game series: \"Nihilanth\"  and \"Absolute,\"  the former being one of the hardest guitar songs in the game with a section topping 25 notes per second. Their song \"The Disguise\" was featured regularly on CFRB's The Richard Syrett Show before the show was discontinued. Their debut full-length album, Beforemath, was released independently, despite record label interest, in April 2012.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nEPs\n2009: Resonance Cascade [Demo]\n2010: Hen In A Pumpkin\n2011: Absolute EP\n2013: Passiveclimactic\n2017: Lost in Darkness and Distance\n2018: Speak True Evil\nStudio albums\n2012: Beforemath\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKill No Albatross on Facebook"

    "text": "Cream Soda is a Russian electronic music group that was founded in 2012 by Dmitry Nova and Ilya Gadaev, who collaborated on a series of Drum and Bass and Dubstep productions after meeting online.\nLooking to explore a more musical and melodic sound, Nova and Gadaev began working with vocalists, including Anna Romanovskaya, who eventually became Cream Sodaâ€™s frontwoman until 2021. With the third member, Anna Romanovskaya, the group recorded their main hits \"No More Parties\", \"Crying at Techno\" and several others.\nSince 2022, Romanovskaya's place in the group has been taken by Alisa Styazhkova[3].\nOn 20 March 2023, the group's founder, Dmitry Nova, was found drowned in the Volga river at the age of 34. He, his brother Roman, and two acquaintances had attempted to cross the frozen Volga River on foot, but the ice was unable to support the group's weight.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Remix albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYoutube\nSpotify\nApple Music\nDeezer\nInstagram\nVK\nCream Soda discography at Discogs"

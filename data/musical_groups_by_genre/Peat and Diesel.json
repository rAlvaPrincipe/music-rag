    "text": "Peat and Diesel are a three-piece band from Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, comprising Calum “Boydie” MacLeod, Innes Scott and Uilly Macleod. The band formed over Saturday sessions at the band members' homes in Stornoway, and grew in popularity through exposure on social media. The band's songs mostly concern a humorous take on  island life, and are predominantly in English, although they include some Gaelic words and phrases.\nIn 2019, the band won \"Live Act of the Year\" at the Scots Trad Music Awards. In the 2020 awards they won \"Best Music Video\" (for Calum Dan’s Transit Van). They were also nominated for best album (for Light my Byre), but lost out to The Woods by Hamish Napier.\nIn 2022, the band stepped in at short notice to replace Sam Ryder's headline appearance at the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival after the former Eurovision contestant pulled out due to illness.\n\n\n== Current members ==\nCalum 'Boydie' MacLeod (guitar and vocals)\nInnes Scott (accordion)\nUilly Macleod (drums)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

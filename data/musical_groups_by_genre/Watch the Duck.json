Their 2018 single, \"There You Are\" was described as \"a more intimate and personal sound starring Jesse's R&B vocal\" and a \"feel-good record that encourages listeners to stay in the moment, and move with whatever feelings come from being in the present.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nWatch the Duck was formed by friends Eddie Smith III, Jesse Rankins, and former member Jonathan Wells. All three were DJs, producers, and musicians originally from Montgomery, Alabama but moved to Atlanta,  Georgia in 2010.

    "text": "Chocolate Milk was an American funk and soul band from New Orleans, Louisiana, active in the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nChocolate Milk was formed in 1974 in New Orleans, Louisiana, after the emergence of the bands Kool & the Gang and Earth, Wind & Fire. The eight-piece band included Frank Richard (vocals), Amadee Castenell (saxophone), Joe Foxx (trumpet), Mario Tio (guitars), Earnest Dabon (bass), Robert Dabon (keyboards/piano) and Dwight Richards (drums/percussion). The band also worked as the studio group for songwriter and producer Allen Toussaint, following the tenure of the Meters as Toussaint's band. Chocolate Milk backed Toussaint as a live band and on his album New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival (1976), and also recorded with Paul McCartney. The band then signed with RCA Records.\nTheir first of eight albums released on RCA was Action Speaks Louder than Words, an album that included a political message. The title cut, \"Action Speaks Louder Than Words\" (1975), has a break beat that has been sampled numerous times in hip hop music, including \"Move the Crowd\" from the 1987 album Paid in Full by Eric B. & Rakim, and \"Don't Let Your Mouth Write a Check Your Ass Can't Cash\" (1991) by Stetsasonic.\nThe band became known for \"Action Speaks Louder than Words\", and other hit songs: \"Girl Callin'\" (1978), \"Say Won't Cha\" (1979), and \"I'm Your Radio\" (1980). The band was also known for their versatility in musical styles, later adding elements of disco, prevalent on their 1981 hit, \"Blue Jeans\" which peaked at number fifteen on the soul chart. Chocolate Milk broke up in 1983 due to the waning popularity of disco, numerous personnel changes, and changes in producers after splitting with Toussaint in 1980.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nAction Speaks Louder than Words (RCA, 1975)\nChocolate Milk (RCA, 1976)\nComin' (RCA, 1976)\nWe're All in This Together (RCA, 1977)\nMilky Way (RCA, 1979)\nHipnotism (RCA, 1980)\nBlue Jeans (RCA, 1981)\nFriction (RCA, 1982)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nIce Cold Funk: The Greatest Grooves of Chocolate Milk (Razor & Tie, 1998)\nBest of Chocolate Milk (Camden, 2002)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChocolate Milk at Discogs\nChocolate Milk at T-Mad's Music"

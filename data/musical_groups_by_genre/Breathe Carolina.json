    "text": "Breathe Carolina are an American electronic music duo from Denver, Colorado. The duo formed in 2007 consisting of David Schmitt and Kyle Even. They later expanded to a full band whose best-known lineup included Schmitt, Even, drummer Eric Armenta, keytarist Joshua Aragon and DJ Luis Bonet. In 2013, Even left the group, while Tommy Cooperman joined that year. Breathe Carolina is currently composed of Schmitt and Cooperman. \nThe band have released five studio albums: It's Classy, Not Classic (2008), Hello Fascination (2009), Hell Is What You Make It (2011), Savages (2014) and Dead: The Album (2019). Their hit single \"Blackout\" was certified platinum in the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings (2007) ===\nKyle Even, born on September 21, 1985, and David Schmitt, born on March 26, 1988, spent their early years playing in various local Colorado musical groups. After being introduced to alternative rock by an older stepbrother, Even moved towards vocals as a teen. Before joining Breathe Carolina, Even performed in the band Rivendale. They produced an extended play called Portrait of Shadows. Schmitt, on the other hand, started on bass at the age of 12 and then branched out to guitar, performing in Colorado with As the Flood Waters Rose (later named the Autobiography).\nBoth bands played together often. As the Flood Waters Rose opened up for Rivendale at Rivendale's album release at Grandpa's Music Box in Thornton. After leaving As the Flood Waters Rose, Schmitt started recording his own song on GarageBand, which he later asked Even to participate in creating. As both bands broke up for the members' departure for college, Even and Schmitt started Breathe Carolina.\n\n\n=== It's Classy, Not Classic (2007–2009) ===\nBreathe Carolina started in 2007 with Even and Schmitt recording songs on the music-creating software GarageBand for fun. They created a Myspace profile, gaining over 10,000 song plays in 2008 and accumulating over 30 million plays during 2009. The name Breathe Carolina came from a dream that Schmitt had in 9th grade, about calming down a woman named Carolina. Soon afterwards, Even quit his job as a photographer to tour with the group full-time. Their first EP, Gossip, was released via iTunes on November 26, 2007. In May 2008, the duo signed with Rise Records and announced the release date of their debut studio album, It's Classy, Not Classic. Breathe Carolina performed at the Bamboozle Left in April 2008.\nBreathe Carolina recorded their first album using GarageBand.

Prior to its release, they released two singles in promotion, \"Drag Me Down\" and \"Alone Tonight\", with Schmitt returning on lead vocals. \n\n\n== Musical style and arrangement ==\nBreathe Carolina has mainly been categorized as electropop, EDM and electronic rock. Post-hardcore influence also existed in the majority of earlier work by the band, evident by the use of screamed vocals and breakdowns. These elements, however, were usually kept to a minimum while electronic elements took precedence. This fusion of post-hardcore characteristics and dance-oriented electronica had once led the group to be labeled crunkcore as well. Also typical of crunkcore is the prevalent use of Auto-Tune and vocoders on Schmitt's vocals.\nTheir debut studio album, It's Classy, Not Classic has been described as electropop, emo and dance music that also blends hardcore-influence of screamo. Their second studio album, Hello Fascination features electronica and emo pop sounds with elements of crunkcore and screamo. The vocoder vocals on the album drew comparison to Daft Punk and Roxette. Their third studio album Hell Is What You Make It is mainly rooted in dance, pop, rock and electronic music. The album also experiments with trance and dubstep music. Their fourth studio album, Savages has been described as electropop and emo pop, with influences of EDM and rock music. Their fifth studio album, Dead: The Album has been described as EDM, including elements of pop and R&B.\nAlthough much instrumentation is added through programming, typical instruments were also present in their music in select songs; Schmitt provided lead singing vocals for the duo along with playing the guitar and drums while Even provided unclean vocals and occasional cleans in their newer material. Live performances by Breathe Carolina usually consisted of an arrangement of three extra members providing keyboards, keytars, drums, guitars and bass. During most live sets, Joshua Aragon played guitar (when necessary) and performs backing vocals while Eric Armenta provided drums on a standard drum kit all while Schmitt and Even performed the clean and unclean vocal positions respectively. \nSince the departure of Kyle Even and the addition of DJ/guitarist Tommy Cooperman, Breathe Carolina became a four piece band. Live performances consisted of the four members and occasional extra musicians like Michael Naran (currently in the Ready Set and Sparks the Rescue). When they performed the song \"Sellouts\" live, Breathe Carolina is joined by a screaming vocalist, usually the lead vocalist from another band, while Luis Bonet and Tommy Cooperman performed guitar parts. After the departure of Bonet in 2015 and Armenta in 2017, Breathe Carolina is now a duo focusing mainly on a variety of styles within the EDM genre.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nOn December 14, 2022, Breathe Carolina member Tommy Cooperman was arrested and charged for engaging in a $114 million \"pump and dump\" scheme along with several others by federal prosecutors. According to reports, Cooperman along with others, \"allegedly engaged in a wide-ranging securities fraud conspiracy\" in which the defendants used their social media presence on Twitter and Discord. The incident took place from around January 2020 to April 2022 and Cooperman was charged with two counts of securities fraud. In March 2024 a federal judge dismissed all charges against Cooperman.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\nIt's Classy, Not Classic (2008)\nHello Fascination (2009)\nHell Is What You Make It (2011)\nSavages (2014)\nDead: The Album (2019)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== DJ Mag ===\n\n\n==== Top 100 DJs ====\n\n\n=== MTV Buzzworthy ===\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nBreathe Carolina at Fearless Records"

After several line-up changes including the addition of songwriter/guitarist John Ivan and Robert Harding, plus drummer Ken Harck, the band's debut album On was released by Atlantic Records in 1979.  The album reached No. 101 on the Billboard 200 and spawned the single \"Stay in Time\" which peaked at No. 51 on the Billboard Hot 100 the week of April 26, 1980. Off Broadway released a follow-up album, Quick Turns, on Atlantic Records in 1980 and continued touring for three years before breaking up in 1983.\nIn early May 1980, \"Stay in Time\" peaked at number 9 on the weekly music surveys of their hometown radio superstation WLS-AM in Chicago, which gave the song much airplay.\nIn 2015, Cliff Johnson began touring as Cliff Johnson and The Raine.\nThe band currently consists of several original On album players.\nIn July 2022, Cliff Johnson died at age 70.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nOn (1979), U.S. No. 101\nQuick Turns (1980), U.S. No. 208\nFallin' In (1997)\nLive At Fitzgeralds (1998)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Stay in Time\" (1979), U.S. No. 51\n\"Bad Indication\" (1979)\n\"Automatic\" (1980)\n\"Are You Alone\" (1980)\n\n\n== References =="

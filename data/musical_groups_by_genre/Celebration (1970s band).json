    "text": "Celebration was a 1970s American rock band, fronted by Beach Boys lead singer Mike Love as well as members of the band King Harvest. Celebration released three albums before they broke up in 1979.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the late 1970s, Beach Boys singer Mike Love began to work on outside projects.  His first major work was with a new band, Celebration. The band featured members of the short lived band King Harvest as well as future and current Beach Boys live backing members. The band's first project was a soundtrack for the film Almost Summer.  The lead single of the name was written by Love and his Beach Boys bandmates Al Jardine and Brian Wilson and also featured backing vocals from Brian Wilson. The song reached No. 28 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978. The band followed up the album with two more albums, one of original material and another of disco numbers. Despite several live appearances and some success, the band disbanded in 1979; however, some members of the group continued to perform with Mike Love in the Beach Boys backing band.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAlmost Summer album:\n\nMike Love - lead vocals\nCharles Lloyd - saxophone, flute\nRon Altbach - keyboards\nDave \"Doc\" Robinson - lead and backing vocals, bass\nPaul Fauerso - backing vocals, keyboards\nEd Carter - guitar\nWells Kelly - bass\nGary Griffin - keyboards\nAdditional musicians:\n\nSteve Douglas - saxophone\nRusty Ford - bass\nTom Smith - drums\nSterling Smith - synthesizers\nEd Tuleja - guitars\nDave Bunch - guitars\nMaureen Love - harp\nCelebration album:\n\nMike Love - lead vocals\nDave \"Doc\" Robinson - backing vocals\nRon Altbach - keyboards\nCharles Lloyd - saxophone\nPaul Fauerso - keyboards, backing vocals\nTim Weston - guitar\nKevin Brandon - bass\nKim Calkins - drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1978: Almost Summer: Music from the Original Motion Picture Score (MCA Records)\n1978: Celebration (Pacific Arts Records)\n1979: Disco Celebration (ADC Records)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1978: \"Almost Summer\" - # 28 on Billboard Hot 100; # 30 on RPM Top 100\n1978: \"It’s O.K.\"\n1978: \"Summer in the City\"/\"Island Girl\"\n1979: \"Country Pie\"/\"Gettin’ Hungry\"\n1979: \"Starbaby\"/\"Gettin’ Hungry\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCelebration discography at Discogs"

    "text": "The Hans-Sachs-Chor Nürnberg is a large concert and oratorio mixed choir with currently about 90 members. It has been directed by Guido Johannes Rumstadt since 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1891–1926 Workers' Choral Society \"Union\" ===\nAfter the repeal of Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Laws, numerous social democratic and trade union Vereins were founded. In Nuremberg, for example, 1891 the forerunner of the Hans Sachs Choir: the Arbeitergesangverein Union, a men's choir. It pursued the goal of practising music and folk culture and bringing it to the working classes This was mainly done through the artistic decoration of festivals. Joint performances of the choir with the Staatsphilharmonie Nürnberg can be traced from about 1910. In 1911, the first \"chair concert\" took place, at which \"no drinks were served and smoking was forbidden\".\n\n\n=== 1926–1933 Volkschor \"Hans Sachs\" ===\nIn 1926, the workers' choral society \"Union\" joined forces with the \"Volkschor Nürnberg-West\" and the \"Volkschor Nürnberg-Süd\". From now on women were also allowed to sing: A large mixed choir was formed. The name \"Volkschor\" emphasised, in the spirit of the workers' movement, the right to education and cultural activity for all people. The Nuremberg shoemaker-poet Hans Sachs was chosen as the patron saint, who served as a model for the connection between artistic and worker activity and whose life and work had itself become the subject of art, for example in the poem Hans Sachsens poetische Sendung (1776) by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and the operas Hans Sachs (1840/45) by Albert Lortzing and Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (1845–68) by Richard Wagner.\nThe activity of the folk choir \"Hans Sachs\" ended with the beginning of the National Socialist era. In the first months of 1933, the choir was dissolved by the state. \"Members in state, public and municipal service\" were induced to leave the choir, which was accused of having \"marxist Attitude\" were charged with resigning, so that \"any financial basis for the continuation of the association was lacking\". This was the reason for dissolving the choir and thus the association on 9 April 1933.\n\n\n=== Re-foundation after liberation ===\nIn 1947, the re-foundation took place with the approval of the American Military Government. Subsequently, a larger concert was held every two to three years.\n\n\n=== Since 1968: Hans Sachs Choir ===\nIn 1968, Wolfgang Riedelbauch, then répétiteur at the Theatre Regensburg, took over the direction of the choir. Under him it received its present name: Hans-Sachs-Chor. The cultivation of classical oratorio literature, taking into account historical performance practice, and the performance of new works became the programme that is still valid today.\nFrom 2000 to 2013, Julian Christoph Tölle, lecturer at the Faculty of Education at the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg, has been the director of the Hans Sachs Choir. Among other things, he facilitated the cooperation with Singer Pur and the Ensemble Kontraste. In February 2014, the general meeting of the Hans Sachs Choir elected Guido Johannes Rumstadt as the new artistic director. The cooperation with him began in July 2014. The provisional direction of the choir in the first half of the year was taken over by Marco Mulzer – the previous assistant to Julian Tölle.\nRumstadt is Professor of Orchestra and Conducting at the Nuremberg University of Music and has worked as First Kapellmeister at the Nuremberg State Theatre since 2007. He studied conducting in Karlsruhe, Hamburg and Salzburg. His first positions as Kapellmeister took him to the Staatstheater Mainz, the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe and as First Kapellmeister to the Staatstheater Wiesbaden and the Frankfurt Opera. During this time, Guido Johannes Rumstadt made guest appearances at numerous international opera houses, including the English National Opera, New York City Opera, Deutsche Oper Berlin, Cologne Opera and La Monnaie Brussels.\nFrom 1998 to 2004, Guido Johannes Rumstadt was General Music Director of the Regensburg Theatre. A special focus of his work was the performance of contemporary and forgotten works. In 2001, he was nominated Conductor of the Year by the professional journal Opernwelt.\nRumstadt will make his debut with the Hans Sachs Choir by rehearsing for the Klassik Open Air of the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra on 9 August in the Luitpoldhain.\nThe Hans Sachs Choir is a member of the Verband Deutscher Konzertchöre (VDKC). It founded the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Nürnberger Konzertchöre (NKC).\n\n\n== Management ==\nThe choir is organised as an association.

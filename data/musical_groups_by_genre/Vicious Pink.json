    "text": "Vicious Pink is a synth-pop duo formed in Leeds, England in 1981. They reformed for a new album in 2023 and will perform live again in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nWith a catchy sound and a penchant for highly provocative and sexualized lyrics, the band's music was aimed toward clubs rather than commercial hits. Vicious Pink consisted of two members, English/French singer Josephine Warden and keyboardist Brian Moss. The duo began as backing vocalists for Soft Cell, then known as Vicious Pink Phenomena.\nVicious Pink are remembered for four dance singles: \"8:15 to Nowhere\", \"Cccan't You See\", and \"Fetish\" produced by Tony Mansfield of New Musik fame. Their last single \"Take Me Now\" was produced by Gary Moberley . \nThe band also backed Soft Cell at The Warehouse in Leeds. The American owner of The Warehouse, Mike Wiand, was their manager. Wiand was also a key factor in the success of the 1980s dance track \"Let the Music Play\" by Shannon, which was released in the UK on his Warehouse Records label. Vicious Pink played live at The Ritz in New York in December 1984.\nVicious Pink were able to briefly attain a cult level of success without ever breaking into the mainstream.  Although they had started releasing music in 1982, they failed to attract much attention until the release of the single \"Cccan't You See\" (UK No. 67) and its instrumental B-side \"8:15 to Nowhere\" in 1984. Over the next two years, both sides of this single accrued play in clubs on both sides of the Atlantic.\nIn 1983, the duo recorded two unreleased demo, Blue and The Tape Gallery, and a self-titled album released in 1986, after they had ceased recording. This album was a collection of previously released singles.\nWarden later married a London-based music lawyer, and Moss continued his music career; he is now the keyboardist for the artist, Mirazma.\nIn 2015, Vicious Pink released various mixes of \"Kings of the Mountains\", a 2012 track.\nIn 2019, Vicious Pink described \"Organiclon Sentient Ship\" as new music.\nIn 2022, Vicious Pink released the double LP West View, containing remasters and demos.\nOn 21 September 2023 during a live stream of Soft Cell and Vicious Pink music and rarities hosted by Dakeyene on Twitch TV, Josie confirmed the band would release a new album, Unexpected on Minimal Wave Records before the end of the year and debuted a new song, \"Not Your Kind of Girl\", and that they would reform for live dates the following year.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nVicious Pink (1986)\nWest View (2022)\nUnexpected (2024)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"My Private Tokyo\" (1982)\n\"Je T'aime\" (1983) (UK #84)\n\"8:15 to Nowhere\" (1984)\n\"Cccan't You See\" (1984) (UK #67)\n\"Fetish\" / \"Spooky\" (1985) (UK #87)\n\"Cccan't You See\" (Remix) (1985) (UK #95)\n\"Take Me Now\" (1986)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBrian Moss's current project"

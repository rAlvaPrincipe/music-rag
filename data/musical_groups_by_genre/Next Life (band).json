    "text": "Next Life is a Norwegian progressive, electronic- and rock-based band led by guitarist and composer Hai Nguyen Dinh, together with Tormod Christensen on bass and Anders Hangård on drums.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFormed by Dinh in 1999 in Tønsberg, Norway, their first show was at The Royal Oak (now called Total) in which the band only used an electric guitar, synth and Amiga computer for drums, bass, and melody lines. The sounds derived, and what is partially still called a \"chip-instrument\", or precisely, the audio-chip of Amiga 1200 and Commodore 64. As Dinh described in many interviews, from early on as a child did he cultivate his love of computer sounds and Commodore 64.\nThough broadly classified as electronic, Next Life has self-professed roots in hardcore punk, metal and game music. They mostly cite music from games as their musical influences, along with bands such as Zeni Geva, Dazzling Killmen, Colossamite and Jean Michel Jarre, but combine their very aggressive, visceral sound with typical RPG/science-fiction themes such as digital technology, astrology, and mythology. Through the years the band has involved new contributors. The band has also been noted for use of live visuals in their shows—spastic video projections and an intensive, programmed lightshow.\nIn 2010, the band toured the UK in support of Canadian composer Owen Pallett (a.k.a. Final Fantasy). In the same year, Next Life provided the opening act for Mayhem in Berlin, Germany.\nThe band has released their music solely on independent labels; primarily a label spawned from Oslo's oldest independent record store, Fysisk Format. Both the album artwork to Electric Violence (2006) and The Lost Age (2009) is by the Norwegian artist Are Mokkelbost. Next Life's latest album entitled, \"Artificial Divinity\" was released in Summer 2011 and received good reviews in national papers.\nNext Life is currently supported by the Arts Council Norway (Kulturrådet).\n\n\n== Band members ==\nHai Nguyen Dinh - guitar, lights, video, audio programming\nPast members:\n\nTormod Christensen (2000-2017) - synth, vocal\nChristian Augustin (2015–2017) - drums\nAnders Hangård (2008-2013) - drums\nTrond Jensen (2008–2009) - samples, programming\nKatrine Bølstad (2004–2006) - vocal\nPetter Snekkestad (1999–2000) - keyboard\nUnn Fahlstrøm (2002) - video\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2006: Electric Violence CD released, 14 tracks.

In 2010, he toured Europe and China as a performer and composer in Verdensteatret, an avant-garde theatre collective sponsored by the Arts Council Norway, the Norwegian Office for Contemporary Art, and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Their performance, \"And All the Questionmarks Started to Sing\", received critical acclaim in Norwegian newspapers. The project is described as, \"a composition in the form of a hybrid between performance, concert and installation. A transparent though complex work with an overwhelming richness of details. It might be described as an art-machine played by musicians, performers and robots.\" In 2011, the company will debut Stateside in New York City's Future Perfect Festival; also coinciding with Next Life's first US tour there.\nAnders Hangård has also played drums in Norwegian metal bands NoPlaceToHide and Saprophyth.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial homepage"

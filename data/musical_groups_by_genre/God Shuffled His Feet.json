    "text": "God Shuffled His Feet is the second album by Canadian band Crash Test Dummies, released in 1993. It features their most popular single, \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\". The cover art superimposes the band members' faces over the figures of Titian's painting Bacchus and Ariadne. It was their most successful album commercially, as it sold over eight million copies worldwide.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe album was the band's biggest mainstream hit. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes the album's success to \"Jerry Harrison's remarkably clear and focused production\" and that \"apart from the relatively concise pop smarts of the singles \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\" and \"Afternoons and Coffeespoons,\" God Shuffled His Feet isn't all that different from the band's first album.\"\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nGod Shuffled His Feet was a number-one album in Austria and New Zealand, and also reached the top five in the national albums charts of numerous countries such as Australia, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. In addition, the album reached number six in the Netherlands national albums chart, number two in the UK Albums Chart, and number nine in the United States Billboard 200 albums chart. In their native Canada, it never reached higher than number 11 on the national charts, but fueled by the success of its four singles (all Top 20 hits there) the album eventually reached triple platinum status.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCrash Test Dummies\nBenjamin Darvill – harmonicas, mandolin, acoustic guitar\nMichel Dorge – drums, percussion\nEllen Reid – piano, keyboards, accordion, backing vocals\nBrad Roberts – lead vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, piano on \"Untitled\"\nDan Roberts – bass guitars, synth bass, backing vocals\nAdditional musicians\nLarry Beers – drums on \"Afternoons & Coffeespoons\", \"In the Days of the Caveman\", and \"When I Go out with Artists\"\nAdrian Belew – synthesized guitars on \"God Shuffled His Feet\"\nKerry Nation – backing vocals on \"Afternoons & Coffeespoons\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGod Shuffled His Feet at Discogs (list of releases) \nGod Shuffled His Feet at MusicBrainz (list of releases)"

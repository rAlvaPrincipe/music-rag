    "text": "Günter Wand (7 January 1912, in Elberfeld, Germany – 14 February 2002, in Ulmiz near Bern, Switzerland) was a German orchestra conductor and composer. Wand studied in Wuppertal, Allenstein and Detmold. At the Cologne Conservatory, he was a composition student with Philipp Jarnach and a piano student with Paul Baumgartner.  He was a conducting pupil of Franz von Hoesslin in Munich, but was otherwise largely self-taught as a conductor. During his 65-year-long career as a conductor, he was particularly revered for his Schubert and Bruckner, and was honoured with many significant awards, including the German Record Award and the internationally important Diapason d'Or.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn February 1924, aged 12, Wand attended a performance of Der Zigeunerbaron at the Thalia Theatre in Wuppertal-Elberfeld, and was so entranced he decided to become a conductor. The role of Sandor Barinkay that evening was sung by Richard Tauber.\n\n\n=== Cologne ===\nWand started his career in Cologne, where he was to stay for several decades, as a conductor of the Cologne Opera in 1939. After World War II his position in Cologne was consolidated as he became Generalmusikdirektor in charge of both the opera and the Gürzenich Orchestra, which he conducted until 1974.\nIn 1948, he also started teaching conducting at a music school in Cologne. From the early 1950s he guest-conducted a number of orchestras, making his London debut in 1951 with the London Symphony Orchestra. Other orchestras who invited him included the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne and Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. \nAfter several recordings of Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven with the Gürzenich for a French subscription collection in the mid-1950s, he made no studio recordings for nearly two decades with the exception of an appearance with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra on Decca Records, accompanying Wilhelm Backhaus in Robert Schumann's Piano Concerto (his only recording with that orchestra). In the 1970s and early 1980s, he recorded the complete symphonies of Franz Schubert and Anton Bruckner with the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne.\n\n\n=== Hamburg and late years ===\nIn 1982, Wand became chief conductor of the NDR Symphony Orchestra. With the latter ensemble, he was able to record the complete symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms as well as works by Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Debussy, Schubert and Schumann. He also remade Bruckner's symphonies 3 to 9.\nIn January 1982, Wand conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra for the first time, and was appointed principal guest conductor of the orchestra that same year.  Wand was noted for demanding considerable rehearsal time, a minimum of 5 to 8 rehearsals, for his London concerts.  On 9 September 1990 his UK Promenade Concert of Bruckner's 5th Symphony with the BBC Symphony was recorded and subsequently released in 2011 on DVD by the BBC/ICA (ICAD 5049).  For his first appearance with a US orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1989, he asked for and received 11 hours of rehearsal time.  Wand subsequently recorded the Brahms Symphony No. 1, part of that first U.S. program, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\nThe highlights of Wand's late career were his annual guest appearances with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, which he conducted in Schubert's \"Unfinished\" and \"Great\" symphonies (1995) and Bruckner's Fifth (1996), Fourth (1998), Ninth (1998), Seventh (1999) and Eighth (2001) symphonies.\n\n\n== Artistic style ==\nAs a conductor, Wand was a deep believer in the originality of music, aiming to perform works exactly as annotated. His art was marked by straightforward adherence to the score.\nAs still a young conductor, a journalist asked him how he'd consider interpreting Beethoven's ninth symphony, more like Arturo Toscanini or rather like Wilhelm Furtwängler. Wand answered laconically: \"Like Beethoven\".\n\n\n== Repertoire ==\nIn his late years, Wand restricted his repertoire almost exclusively to the symphonies of Anton Bruckner (which he had never conducted until he was over 60), Schubert, Brahms, Beethoven and Mozart. Earlier in his career, however, he was a devoted interpreter of the contemporary music of such composers as Frank Martin, György Ligeti, Edgard Varèse, Olivier Messiaen, and initially Bernd Alois Zimmermann as well.\nWand regarded Bruckner as the \"most important symphonist after Beethoven\". Wand's biographer Wolfgang Seifert wrote that \"it is no exaggeration to say that Günter Wand has made an indispensable contribution toward the understanding of Bruckner in our time.\"\n\n\n== Compositions ==\nWand also composed music, mostly songs with orchestral accompaniment and music for ballet.  One composition was his concertino \"Odi et amo\", for soprano and chamber orchestra, which Wand wrote for his wife, the soprano Anita Westhoff. Anita Wand (Westhoff) died on 29 December 2009 at Ulmiz (CH), at the age of 89 years.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nDuring his over 65-year-long career as conductor, Günter Wand received several important prizes, including German Record Award, the German Record Critic's Prize, the Echo Award and twice the internationally significant Diapason d'Or, which he received for his Schubert and Bruckner recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1996 Wand received the rarely awarded Hans von Bülow Medal.\n\n\n== Discography (sel.) ==\nWith NDR-Sinfonieorchester:\nBeethoven:\nSinfonie Nr. 3 & Leonoren Ouvertüre Nr. 3  CD RD60755 (03/1991)\nSinfonien Nr. 5 & 6  CD 09026 61930 2 (10/1993)\nSinfonien Nr. 1 & 2  CD 74321 66458 2 (04/2001)\nSinfonie Nr.1 & Nr.6 Nr.74321891082(11/2001)\nSinfonie Nr.2 & Nr.7 Nr.74321891072(11/2001)\nSinfonie Nr.3 & Nr.8 Nr.74321891062(11/2001)\nSinfonie Nr.4 & Nr.5 Nr.74321891052(11/2001)\nSinfonie Nr.9 Nr.74321891042 (11/2001)\nSinfonien Nr. 1-9 74321891092 (11/2001)\nSinfonie Nr.4 Nr.74321897172 (01/2002)\nBrahms:\nSinfonie Nr. 1  CD 09026 68889 2 (02/1998)\nSinfonien Nr. 2 & 3  CD 09026 68888 2 (02/1998)\nSinfonien Nr. 1-4 3CD 09026 63348 2 (01/1999)\nSinfonie Nr. 4 CD 09026 63244 2 (01/1999)\nSinfonien Nr.1 & Nr.3 Nr.74321891022 (11/2001)\nSinfonien Nr.2 & Nr.4 Nr.74321891012 (11/2001)\nSinfonien Nr.1-4  Nr.74321891032 (11/2001)\nBruckner:\nSinfonie Nr. 5 (Originalfassung)  CD RD60361 (06/90)\nSinfonie Nr. 4 „Romantische“ CD RD60784 (04/1991)\nSinfonie Nr. 4 2CD 74321930412\nSinfonie Nr. 7 (Originalfassung) CD 09026 61398 2 (03/1993)\nSinfonie Nr. 9 (Originalfassung)  CD 09026 62650 2 (06/1994)\nSinfonie Nr. 8  2CD 09026 68047 2 (04/1995)\nSinfonie Nr. 6 (Originalfassung) CD 09026 68452 2 (06/1996)\nDebussy: Le Martyre de Saint Sébastien; CD 74321 75583 (05/2000)\nFortner: Bluthochzeit – Zwischenspiele für Orchester; CD RD60827 (12/1991)\nMartin: Petite Symphonie concertante;\nMozart:\nSinfonie Nr.36\nSinfonien Nr. 39 & 41 „Jupiter“ CD RD60714 (12/1990)\nSinfonie Nr. 40;\nPosthornserenade Nr.74321897172\nMussorgsky: Bilder einer Ausstellung\nSchubert\nSinfonie Nr. 5\nSinfonie Nr. 8 „Unvollendete“; CD RD60826 (12/1991)\nSinfonie Nr. 9 „Große C-Dur“ CD RD60978 (12/1991)\nSchumann: Sinfonie Nr. 4\nStravinsky\nConcerto in Es (Dumbarton Oaks);\nPulcinella Suite; CD 09026 61190 2 (10/1992)\nTchaikovsky\nSinfonie Nr. 5 CD 09026 68032 2 (11/1994)\nSinfonie Nr. 6 „Pathétique“\nWebern: 5 Stücke für Orchester, op.10\nNDR Live-Recordings 1989-1995:\nBeethoven, Bruckner, Mozart, Tschaikowsky, Schubert 17 CD Box 74321 34162 2 (09/1996)\nWith Kölner Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester:\nBruckner:\nThe 9 Symphonies 10CD 09026639302 (08/1989)\nSymphony No. 1 (Wiener Fassung) CD 09026639312 (12/1989)\nSymphony No. 2 CD 09026639322 (12/1989)\nSymphony No. 3 CD 09026639332 (12/1989)\nSymphony No. 4 „Romantische“ CD 09026639342 (12/1989)\nSymphony No. 5  CD 09026639352 (12/1989)\nSymphony No. 6 CD 09026639362 (12/1989)\nSymphony No. 7  CD 09026639372 (12/1989)\nSymphony No. 8 & 9 CD 09026639382 (12/1989)\nSchubert:\nThe Complete Symphonies 5CD 09026639402 (08/1989)\nSymphony No. 1 & 2 CD 09026639412\nSymphony No. 3 & 6 CD 09026639422\nSymphony No 4 & 8 CD 09026639432\nSymphony No 5 (Selections from Rosamunde) CD 09026639442\nSymphony No. 9 CD 09026639452\nWith Berliner Philharmoniker:\nBruckner:\nSinfonie Nr. 5 (Originalfassung)CD 09026 68503 2 (12/1996)\nSinfonie Nr. 4 „Romantische“ (Haas-Fassung) CD 09026 68839 2 (08/1998)\nSinfonie Nr. 9 (Originalfassung) CD 74321 63244 2 (08/1999)\nSinfonie Nr. 7 CD 74321 68716 2 (10/2000)\nSinfonie Nr.8 CD Nr.743218 28662 (11/2001)\nSchubert:\nSinfonie Nr. 8 „Unvollendete“ & 9 „Große C-Dur“;  2CD 09026 68314 2 (08/1995)\n\n\n== Literature ==\nWolfgang Seifert: Günter Wand: so und nicht anders.

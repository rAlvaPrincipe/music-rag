    "text": "Harlem Spartans, often abbreviated to HS, also known as Harlem O or simply Harlem, is a British hip hop collective based in Kennington, London. Members of Harlem Spartans have acquired over 100 million streams through their music. The name, \"Harlem\", is a nickname for their local area of Kennington. The police allege that Harlem Spartans is a gang, however this is denied by the group.\nHarlem Spartans is affiliated with Walworth-based group Moscow17. Australian drill group Onefour cites Harlem Spartans as a major influence in their music. They are considered to be one of the pioneers of the UK drill scene.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings (2014–2018) ===\nHarlem Spartans started making music in 2014, using a local youth centre as a music studio. Most artists within Harlem Spartans are from Kennington, with many of them attending Archbishop Tenison's School in Oval. Musically, like much of UK drill music, their music contains references to their local area, violence, references to disputes with other groups (referred to as “beef”), and is often riddled with slang.\nThe group is known for its rivalry with Brixton-based group 410. The rivalry has been expressed through various diss tracks, and has at times escalated to physical violence. 410 rapper AM released the song \"Attempted 1.0\" in 2018. The song contained many direct references to violence towards Harlem Spartans members. Skengdo & AM, members of 410, were later given a gang injunction from the police that banned them from entering Kennington or mentioning rival gangs in their music.\n\n\n=== Rise to fame and success of Harlem Spartans (2018–present) ===\nProminent songs from the group include \"Call Me a Spartan\", \"Kennington Where It Started\", and Loski's songs \"Cool Kid\", \"Hazards\", and \"Forrest Gump\", the latter of which entered the charts. These songs combined have gained over 65 million views on YouTube, as of October 2023. In April 2018, Loski released his mixtape Call Me Loose.\nCanadian artist Drake has publicly stated he is a 'fan' of Harlem Spartans, and has posted Harlem Spartan music lyrics onto his social media. In 2019, Drake appeared on-stage alongside Harlem Spartans member Loski. Drake credited Loski as an influence for his album Scorpion.\n\n\n== Current members ==\nThe list below includes confirmed members of Harlem Spartans.

The violent attack started after Elijah Morgan and Jedaiah Param got into the minicab and Davis attacked Morgan with a mallet. The minicab drove away from the scene a short distance before the driver was told to stop and Elijah Morgan and Jedaiah Param got out and started chasing Davis. CCTV footage from Ha’penny Hatch showed that Davis was pursued by the pair, as well as two other unidentified males, who were all armed with knives or machetes. Davis' friend had tried to place himself between him and the attackers, but he was overpowered. All four of them stabbed Davis, who collapsed to the ground.\nDespite paramedics' efforts, Crosslon died a short time later due to the loss of blood from at least nine stab wounds, including one that penetrated his lung and heart. He was pronounced dead at 03:30 after being stabbed multiple times. Bis was 20-years old at time of death.

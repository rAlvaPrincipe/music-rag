    "text": "Austin TV is an instrumental post-rock band formed in 2001 in Mexico City. Austin TV creates sonic landscapes with their music without lyrics. They have opened for groups like Yo La Tengo in Mexico and Café Tacuba in the U.S. leg of their 2007 tour, and have released three LPs, one EP and appearances in many Mexican independent bands compilations. Like The Residents or Devo, the group usually performs on stage with masks, disguises and uniforms. Concealing their identity in this way personifies their motto: \"Your face is not important. The truth is inside\".\nAustin TV has shared the stage with many important bands of the Mexican scene, as well as international bands such as Mogwai, Tristeza, the Album Leaf and Incubus, among others. They have played at very important festivals like Vive Latino, Zero Fest, Motorokr Fest, SXSW, Personal Fest in Argentina, Manifest, Festival Cervantino, LAMC in New York, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and recently at the Rock al Parque Fest in Colombia, and \"Quitofest\" in Ecuador. They have also opened at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago.\nAfter reuniting in 2022, they released their fifth album, Rizoma, on September 28, 2023.\n\n\n== Members ==\nChiosan (keyboards and samplers)\nFando (guitar)\nRata (bass) – A former member of the Mexican emo-punk band Spandex\nXna Yer (drums – beat box and kaoss pad) – Former member of the Mexican punk rock band Hulespuma and since 2013 member of Dolores De Huevos\nTotore (guitar)\nGuest Members\n\nJosué \"Hobbit mayor\" Ortíz (guitar @ Los Perros Predicen Temblores concert)\nFormer Members\n\nChato (guitar, left the band after Coachella 2008 and a few more concerts)\nPasa (bass, left the band in 2003)\nIsra de Viana - Zaiya (guitar, left the band in 2003)\n\n\n== Indie-O Music Awards ==\nOn June 11, 2008, Austin TV received four awards at the Indie-O Music Awards, the first awards created to recognize the best of the independent music scene in Mexico. \nThe categories from which they received an award were:\n\nPeople's choice\nBest punk & subgenre album\nBest album's art design (Trevore Valenzuela & Marcos Castro's art)\nBest band of the year.\n\n\n== Coachella 2008 ==\nDuring the presentation of Fontana Bella in Mexico City (in late October, 2007), the band's manager, Carlos \"Jiju\" Ruiz announced that the band was confirmed to be playing at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, an American festival held in Indio, CA.\nTaking advantage of this, they prepared a California U.S. tour with five previous dates to Coachella.\nThe dates were:\n\nApril 19: Tijuana BC, Mex. @ Multiculti\nApril 20: Chulavista CA, USA.\nApril 21: Pomona CA, USA @ Glasshouse\nApril 23: Oxnard CA, USA.\nApril 24: Sn.

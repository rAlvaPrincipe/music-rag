    "text": "John Cook (August 10, 1847 â€“ August 3, 1915) was a bugler in the Union Army during the American Civil War. At age 15, he earned the United States military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions at the Battle of Antietam.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nCook enlisted in the Union Army at age 14 in Cincinnati, Ohio, and served as a bugler in Battery B of the 4th U.S. Artillery Regiment. During the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, his unit supported General John Gibbon's attack down the Hagerstown Turnpike. Immediately after unlimbering their guns, the battery came under fire from Confederate infantrymen in the West Woods. Cook helped a wounded officer to the rear and, upon returning to his unit, found that most of the cannoneers had been killed. Seeing a dead artilleryman with a full pouch of ammunition, Cook took the pouch and began servicing the cannons. He continued to work as a cannoneer throughout the attack, despite intense fire from Confederate soldiers who came within 15 feet of the guns.\nThe next year, Cook participated in the Battle of Gettysburg, where he carried messages across a half-mile of fire-swept terrain. During that battle, he helped destroy a damaged caisson to prevent it from falling into the hands of approaching Confederates.\nFor his actions at Antietam, Cook was awarded the Medal of Honor several decades later, on June 30, 1894. His official Medal of Honor citation reads:\n\nVolunteered at the age of 15 years to act as a cannoneer, and as such volunteer served a gun under a terrific fire of the enemy.\nCook died at age 67 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington County, Virginia.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Medal of Honor recipients\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the United States Army Center of Military History."

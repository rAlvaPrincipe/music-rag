The band officially called it quits, however, on 6 March 2007, deciding to have their final gig the following day. It is still not clear as to why the split occurred since that information has not been publicly announced yet.\nVeto Silver has been on tour in the UK with rock band Protokoll.\nThe group's first EP, \"When You're With That Girl\", came out in 2005 as a limited release.

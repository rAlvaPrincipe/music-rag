    "text": "Collide is an American industrial music duo formed in Los Angeles in 1992, that has incorporated elements of trip hop, synthpop and music from the Middle East into their sound.\nThe name comes from the 'collision' of musical styles, primarily the ethereal vocals provided by kaRIN and the electronic music provided by Statik. Collide's debut album, Beneath the Skin, was released in 1996, followed by a remix album, Distort, in 1998.   Dissatisfied with the music industry, Collide started their own record label, Noiseplus Music, and in 2000, they released their second studio album, Chasing the Ghost. \nThree years later, they released their third studio album, Some Kind of Strange. The following year, the band released another remix album, Vortex, containing remixes by numerous remix artists, including Charlie Clouser and Rhys Fulber. Joining kaRIN and Statik this time around, and for their first live performances a little later in the year, were Scott Landes (guitar), Roger DaSilva (guitar), Chaz Pease (drums), and Kai Kurosawa (Warr guitars/bass).\nIn 2005, Collide released a DVD, entitled Like the Hunted, along with a live CD Live at The El Rey. Then they recorded with Curve's Dean Garcia in a project called The Secret Meeting. The album, Ultrashiver, was released under their Noiseplus label on June 26, 2007.  On September 23, 2008, the band released their fourth studio album Two Headed Monster.  Special guests on the album included Danny Carey from Tool and Dean Garcia from Curve.\nAt Halloween 2009, the album These Eyes Before was released. It was a 10-song album of cover versions of well-known songs by artists such as The Beatles, Depeche Mode, Radiohead, and Pink Floyd. \nIn January 2011, Collide was nominated for The 10th Annual Independent Music Awards under the Cover Song category for \"The Lunatics Have Taken Over the Asylum\".\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Full time members ===\nkaRIN – vocals, lyrics\nStatik – music, production\n\n\n=== Live members ===\nScott Landes – guitars\nRogerio Silva – guitars\nChaz Pease – drums\nKai Kurosawa – Warr Guitar/bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\n...The Crimson Trial (1994, Noiseplus)\nBeneath the Skin (1996, Re-Constriction)\nChasing the Ghost (2000, Noiseplus)\nSome Kind of Strange (2003, Noiseplus)\nTwo Headed Monster (2008, Noiseplus)\nThese Eyes Before (2009, Noiseplus)\nCounting to Zero (2011, Noiseplus)\nColor of Nothing (2017, Noiseplus)\nMind & Matter (2018, Noiseplus)\nNotes From the Universe (2022, Noiseplus)\nExtended Plays\n\nSkin (1996, Nightshade)\nDeep/Violet's Dance (1997, Re-Constriction)\nNot Forgotten (2008, Noiseplus)\nLive albums\n\nLive at The El Rey (2005, Noiseplus)\nCompilation albums\n\nDistort (1998, Re-Constriction)\nVortex (2004, Noiseplus)\nBent and Broken (2012, Noiseplus)\nBest of Collide (2013, Noiseplus)\nThe Darkness Forever (2024, Noiseplus)\n\n\n=== Releases with Dean Garcia/The Secret Meeting ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nCollide on Bandcamp\nCollide's channel on YouTube\nCollide discography at Discogs \nCollide discography at MusicBrainz"

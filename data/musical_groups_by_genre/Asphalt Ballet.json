Their style is rooted in blues rock and incorporates elements of hard rock and Southern rock.\nThe band's name was derived from descriptive terminology used to depict a motorcyclist, crashing and skidding along an asphalt concrete road at high speed.

Ulrich, \n\n\n== History ==\nVirgin Records signed the band and released their self-titled debut album in 1991. Asphalt Ballet was crowned champion of Headbangers Ball with the video \"Soul Survive\" that remained unbeating going head to head with Ozzy Osbourne, The Cult, and others over a two month period. Unfortunately singer Gary Jeffries left the band due to personal problems in 1992. Their second album, Pigs, was released in 1993, with Tommy Dean on lead vocals. The band toured with Great White throughout 1993 in support of the \"Pigs\" record.\nAll members are currently alive and well with talk of a possible 35 year reunion @ Sturgis in 2025.

    "text": "Stereo Nova (Greek: Στέρεο Νόβα) is a Greek electronic music band, whose main output was in the 1990s. Widely thought of as a pioneer band in the nascent electronic genre in Greece, they were also voted as the best Greek band for the year 1994 according to MTV Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\nStereo Nova was formed in the early 1990s by Kbhta, Michalis Delta. Their first name was Bobby Blast. They changed their name to \"Stereo Nova\" for the release of their self titled debut. They were later joined by a third member, Antonis Pi, who left the group after the release of \"Telson\".\nStereoNova recorded five albums (StereoNova, Discolata, Asyrmatos Kosmos, Telson, Vitamina Tek), while, soon after their disbanding another disc was released –co-produced with Stamatis Kraounakis (Ofelimo Fortio) and another (studio processed live performances disc) titled S.K.A.Z.I. (Skorpia Kommatia Apo Zontanes Ihografisis – Scattered Tracks From Live Recordings).\nOn 5 December 2008, 11 years after their disbandment, the band reunited for a performance at a party held by popular Athenian weekly LIFO - \"a gift to our old fans and our new friends\" as Kbhta stated.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nStereo Nova are widely recognized as dance and electronic music pioneers in Greece.

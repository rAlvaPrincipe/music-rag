    "text": "Daft Punk was a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They achieved early popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement, combining elements of house music with funk, disco, techno, rock and synth-pop. They are regarded as one of the most influential acts in dance music.\nDaft Punk formed after Bangalter and de Homem-Christo's indie rock band, Darlin', disbanded. Their debut album, Homework, was released by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by the singles \"Around the World\" and \"Da Funk\". From 1999, Daft Punk assumed robot personas for public appearances, with helmets, outfits and gloves to disguise their identities. They made few media appearances. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter, the head of Ed Banger Records.\nDaft Punk's second album, Discovery (2001), earned acclaim and further success, with the hit singles \"One More Time\", \"Digital Love\" and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". It became the basis for an animated film, Interstella 5555, supervised by the Japanese artist Leiji Matsumoto. Daft Punk's third album, Human After All (2005), received mixed reviews, though the singles \"Robot Rock\" and \"Technologic\" were successful in the UK. Daft Punk directed an avant-garde science-fiction film, Electroma, released in 2006. They toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album; the tour is credited for broadening the appeal of dance music in North America. Daft Punk composed the score for the 2010 film Tron: Legacy.\nIn 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for Columbia Records and released their fourth and final album, Random Access Memories, to acclaim. The lead single, \"Get Lucky\", reached the top 10 in the charts of 27 countries. Random Access Memories won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Get Lucky\". In 2016, Daft Punk gained their only number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with \"Starboy\", a collaboration with The Weeknd. Rolling Stone ranked them the 12th-greatest musical duo of all time in 2015, and included Discovery and Random Access Memories on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Daft Punk announced their split in 2021.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1987–1992: Early career and Darlin' ===\n\nGuy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter met in 1987 while attending the Lycée Carnot secondary school in Paris. The two became friends and recorded demos with others from the school. In 1992, they formed a band, Darlin', with Bangalter on bass, Homem-Christo on guitar, and Laurent Brancowitz on guitar and drums. The trio named themselves after the Beach Boys song \"Darlin'\", which they covered along with an original composition. Both tracks were released on a multi-artist EP under Duophonic Records, a label owned by the London-based band Stereolab, who invited Darlin' to open for shows in the United Kingdom.\nDarlin' disbanded after around six months, having played two gigs and produced four songs. Bangalter described the project as \"pretty average\". Brancowitz formed another band, Phoenix. Bangalter and Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers. The name was taken from a negative review of Darlin' in Melody Maker by Dave Jennings, who dubbed their music \"a daft punky thrash\". The band found the review amusing. Homem-Christo said, \"We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and [this name] happened so quickly.\"\n\n\n=== 1993–1996: First performances and singles ===\n\nIn September 1993, Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, the co-founder of the Scottish label Soma Quality Recordings. They gave him a demo tape, which formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, \"The New Wave\", a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of \"The New Wave\" called \"Alive\", which appeared on Daft Punk's first album.\nDaft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record \"Da Funk\". After it became their first commercially successful single, they hired a manager, Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype nightclubs. They signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal to license tracks through their production company, Daft Trax. Bangalter said that while they received numerous offers from record labels, they wanted to wait and ensure that they did not lose creative control. He considered the deal with Virgin more akin to a partnership.\nIn the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live at various events, without the costumes they later became known for. In 1996, they made their first performance in the United States, at an Even Furthur event in Wisconsin. In addition to live original performances, they performed in clubs using vinyl records from their collection. They were known for incorporating numerous styles of music into their DJ sets.\n\n\n=== 1997–1999: Homework ===\nDaft Punk released their debut album, Homework, in 1997. That February, the UK dance magazine Muzik published a Daft Punk cover feature and described Homework as \"one of the most hyped debut albums in a long long time\". According to The Village Voice, the album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula. The critic Alex Rayner wrote that it combined established club styles and the \"burgeoning eclecticism\" of big beat. In 1997, Daft Punk embarked on an international concert tour, Daftendirektour, using their home equipment for the live stage. On 25 May, they headlined the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, with Orbital and Kraftwerk.\nThe most successful single from Homework was \"Around the World\". \"Da Funk\" was also included on The Saint film soundtrack. Daft Punk produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The videos were collected in 1999 as D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes.\nBangalter and Homem-Christo created their own record labels, Roulé and Crydamoure, after the release of Homework, and released solo projects by themselves and their friends. Homem-Christo released music as a member of Le Knight Club with Eric Chedeville, and Bangalter released music as a member of Together with DJ Falcon and founded the group Stardust with Alan Braxe and Benjamin Diamond. In 1998, Stardust released their only song, the chart hit \"Music Sounds Better With You\".\n\n\n=== 1999–2003: Discovery ===\nDaft Punk's second album, Discovery, was released in 2001. They said it was an attempt to reconnect with the playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. The album reached No. 2 in the UK, and its lead single, \"One More Time\", was a hit. The song is heavily autotuned and compressed. The singles \"Digital Love\" and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" were also successful in the UK and on the US Dance Chart, and \"Face to Face\" hit number one on the US club play charts.\nDiscovery created a new generation of Daft Punk fans. It also saw Daft Punk debut their distinctive robot costumes; they had previously worn Halloween masks or bags for promotional appearances. Discovery was later named one of the best albums of the decade by publications including Pitchfork and Resident Advisor. In 2020, Rolling Stone included it at number 236 in its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2021, Pitchfork cited Discovery as the centrepiece of Daft Punk's career, \"an album that transcended the robots' club roots and rippled through the decades that followed\".\nDaft Punk partnered with the Japanese manga artist Leiji Matsumoto to create Interstella 5555, a feature-length animation set to Discovery. The first four episodes were shown on Toonami in 2001, and the finished film was released on DVD in 2003. That December, Daft Punk released Daft Club, a compilation of Discovery remixes. In 2001, Daft Punk released a 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance as Alive 1997.\n\n\n=== 2004–2007: Human After All and Alive 2007 ===\n\nIn March 2005, Daft Punk released their third album, Human After All, the result of six weeks of writing and recording. Reviews were mixed, with criticism for its repetitiveness and darker mood. \"Robot Rock\", \"Technologic\", \"Human After All\" and \"The Prime Time of Your Life\" were released as singles. A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD, Musique Vol. 1 1993–2005, was released on 4 April 2006. Daft Punk also released a remix album, Human After All: Remixes.\nOn 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered a film, Daft Punk's Electroma, at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight. The film does not include Daft Punk's music. Midnight screenings were held in Paris theaters from March 2007.\nFor 48 dates across 2006 and 2007, Daft Punk performed the Alive 2006/2007 world tour, performing a \"megamix\" of their music from a large LED-fronted pyramid. The tour was acclaimed and is credited for bringing dance music to a wider audience, especially in North America. The Guardian journalist Gabriel Szatan likened it to how the Beatles' 1964 performance on The Ed Sullivan Show had brought British rock and roll to the American mainstream.\nDaft Punk's performance in Paris was released as their second live album, Alive 2007, on 19 November 2007. The live version of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" was released as a single, with a video by Olivier Gondry comprising audience footage of their performance in Brooklyn. In 2009, Daft Punk won Grammy Awards for Alive 2007 and its single \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\".\n\n\n=== 2008–2011: Tron: Legacy ===\n\nIn 2007, Kanye West sampled \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" in his single \"Stronger\". Daft Punk made a surprise appearance at the 50th Grammy Awards on 10 February 2008, and performed a reworked version of \"Stronger\" with West at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. It was the first televised Daft Punk live performance.\nIn 2008, Daft Punk returned to Paris to work on new material. Winter also stepped down as their manager to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He said later that Daft Punk were working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles. Daft Punk held their Daft Arts production office at the Jim Henson Studios complex in Hollywood. Daft Punk provided new mixes for the 2009 video game DJ Hero, and appeared as playable characters.\nAt the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that Daft Punk had composed 24 tracks for the film Tron: Legacy. Daft Punk's score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. The band collaborated with him for two years on the score, from pre-production to completion. The score features an 85-piece orchestra, recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Studios in London. Joseph Kosinski, director of the film, referred to the score as a mixture of orchestral and electronic elements. Daft Punk also make a cameo as disc jockey programs wearing their trademark robot helmets within the film's virtual world. The soundtrack album was released on 6 December 2010. A music video for \"Derezzed\" premiered on the MTV Networks on the same day the album was released. The video, which features Olivia Wilde as the character Quorra in specially shot footage, along with images of Daft Punk in Flynn's Arcade, was later made available for purchase from the iTunes Store and included in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film. Walt Disney Records released a remix album, Tron: Legacy Reconfigured, on 5 April 2011.\nIn 2010, Daft Punk were admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an order of merit of France. Bangalter and Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of Chevalier (knight). On October of that year, Daft Punk made a surprise guest appearance during the encore of Phoenix's show at Madison Square Garden in New York City. They played a medley of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" and \"Around the World\" before the song segued into Phoenix's song \"1901\". They also included elements of their tracks \"Rock'n Roll\", \"Human After All\", and \"Together\", one of Bangalter's releases as a member of Together. They produced N.E.R.D.'s 2010 song \"Hypnotize U\".\n\n\n=== 2011–2015: Random Access Memories ===\n In 2011, Soma Records released a previously unpublished Daft Punk track, \"Drive\", recorded while they were signed to Soma in the 1990s. It was included in a 20th-anniversary compilation of the Soma label. In October 2012, Daft Punk provided a 15-minute mix of songs by blues musician Junior Kimbrough for Hedi Slimane's Yves Saint Laurent fashion show. Daft Punk recorded their fourth studio album, Random Access Memories, with musicians including Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Panda Bear, Chilly Gonzales, Paul Williams, Pharrell Williams, Chic frontman Nile Rodgers and Giorgio Moroder. Daft Punk left Virgin for Sony Music Entertainment through the Columbia Records label.\nRandom Access Memories was released on 17 May 2013. The lead single, \"Get Lucky\", became Daft Punk's first UK number-one single and the most-streamed new song in the history of Spotify. At the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, Daft Punk debuted a trailer for their single \"Lose Yourself to Dance\" and presented the award for \"Best Female Video\" alongside Rodgers and Pharrell. In December, they revealed a music video for the song \"Instant Crush\", directed by Warren Fu and featuring Casablancas.\nAt the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, Random Access Memories won the Grammy for Best Dance/Electronica Album, Album of the Year and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, while \"Get Lucky\" received the Grammy for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year. Daft Punk performed at the ceremony with Stevie Wonder, Rodgers, Pharrell, and the Random Access Memories rhythm players Nathan East, Omar Hakim, Paul Jackson, Jr. and Chris Caswell. That night, Daft Punk hosted a large Grammys afterparty at the Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, with many celebrities and no photography allowed.\nDaft Punk co-produced Kanye West's sixth studio album, Yeezus (2013), creating the tracks \"On Sight\", \"Black Skinhead\", \"I Am a God\" and \"Send It Up\" with West. They provided additional vocals for Pharrell's 2014 single \"Gust of Wind\". On 10 March 2014, an unreleased Daft Punk song, \"Computerized\", leaked online. It features Jay-Z and contains \"The Son of Flynn\" from the Tron: Legacy soundtrack; it was once intended to be a single promoting Tron: Legacy. In April 2015, Daft Punk appeared in a short tribute to Rodgers as part of a documentary on his life, Nile Rodgers: From Disco to Daft Punk. In June, a documentary, Daft Punk Unchained, was released.\n\n\n=== 2016–2020: Final projects and appearances ===\n\nDaft Punk appeared on the 2016 singles \"Starboy\" and \"I Feel It Coming\" by Canadian R&B singer the Weeknd; \"Starboy\" topped the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Daft Punk's only US number-one song, and \"I Feel It Coming\" reached number four. In 2017, Soma Records released a remix of \"Drive\" by Slam as part of a compilation featuring various artists. In February 2017, Daft Punk launched a pop-up shop in Hollywood, California, featuring memorabilia, artwork, and a display of their costumes. They also performed with the Weeknd at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards on 12 February 2017.\nIn the years following the Starboy collaborations, Bangalter and Homem-Christo worked solo as producers appearing on several projects. On 21 June 2017, the Australian band Parcels released the song \"Overnight\", produced and co-written by Daft Punk. It was written after Daft Punk saw Parcels perform and invited the members to their studio. This became Daft Punk's final production together. \nBetween 9 April and 11 August 2019, an electronic exhibition based on Daft Punk's song \"Technologic\" was displayed at the Philharmonie de Paris, featuring costumes, guitars and other elements. In early 2024, W. F. Quinn Smith, who played percussion on Random Access Memories, said he had participated in experimental recording sessions for a new Daft Punk album in early 2018, but that the project was in limbo.\n\n\n=== 2021–present: Disbandment and aftermath ===\nOn 22 February 2021, Daft Punk released a video on their YouTube channel titled \"Epilogue\". The video features a scene from their 2006 film Electroma, in which one robot explodes and the other walks away into the sunset; a title card created with Warren Fu reads \"1993–2021\" while an excerpt of Daft Punk's song \"Touch\" plays. Later that day, Daft Punk's longtime publicist, Kathryn Frazier, confirmed that they had split, but did not give a reason. The news led to a surge in Daft Punk sales, with digital album purchases rising by 2,650%. Their friend and collaborator Todd Edwards confirmed that Bangalter and Homem-Christo remained active separately. He later said they were \"going in different directions\", and that Homem-Christo was more drawn to hip-hop and Bangalter was interested in film. As of 2023, Bangalter and Homem-Christo still shared a studio and equipment.\nOn 22 February 2022, one year after their disbandment, Daft Punk announced a 25th-anniversary edition of Homework. It included a remix album, Homework (Remixes), which was also released separately. Daft Punk also broadcast a Twitch stream of their performance at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles from their 1997 Daftendirektour. The video featured previously unreleased footage of the duo without costumes. Daft Punk released behind-the-scenes \"archives\" from the D.A.F.T. DVD and album reissues throughout 2022.\nOn 12 May 2023, Daft Punk released a 10th-anniversary edition of Random Access Memories, with 35 minutes of previously unreleased outtakes and demos. \"Infinity Repeating (2013 Demo)\", featuring Casablancas and the Voidz, was released as a single. It was released alongside a music video and was called Daft Punk's \"last song ever\" in press releases. On 17 November, Daft Punk released a version of Random Access Memories with no drums or percussion.\nIn April 2023, Bangalter released a solo work, the orchestral ballet score Mythologies. He gave interviews about the project and allowed himself to be photographed without a mask. He cited concerns about the progress of artificial intelligence and other technology as to why Daft Punk split, saying: \"As much as I love this character, the last thing I would want to be, in the world we live in, in 2023, is a robot.\" Bangalter said Daft Punk had wanted to not \"spoil the narrative\" while they were active, but now felt more comfortable revealing parts of their creative process. Reflecting on the split, Bangalter said he was \"relieved and happy to look back and say: 'Okay, we didn't mess it up too much.'\"\nOn 22 February 2024, the third anniversary of their split, Daft Punk announced a Twitch broadcast of Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. A vinyl repress of the Discovery single \"Something About Us\" was released on Record Store Day in April 2024. A 4K remaster of Interstella 5555 premiered in June at Tribeca Festival. The remaster will be shown in global theaters for one day only in December.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Musical style ===\nDaft Punk's musical style has been described as house, French house, electronic, dance, and disco. Sean Cooper of AllMusic described it as a blend of acid house, techno, pop, indie rock, hip hop, progressive house, funk, and electro. \nThe Guardian critic Alexis Petridis described their approach as magpie-like, with extensive sampling. Homem-Christo described it as bricolage, the art of using found sounds to create new work. Bangalter said in 2008: \"I think that sampling is always something that we've completely legitimately done. It's not something we've hidden, it's almost a partisan or ideological way of making music, sampling things and being sampled ... It's always been a way to reinterpret things—sometimes it's using [an] element from the past, or sometimes recreating them and fooling the eyes or the ears, which is just a fun thing to do.\" \nAccording to Pitchfork, some fans were disappointed to discover that Daft Punk used samples. In 2007, Rapster released Discovered: A Collection of Daft Funk Samples, a compilation of tracks sampled by Daft Punk. Pitchfork wrote: \"If [the compilation] proves anything, it isn't that Daft Punk are surreptitious thieves — it's that they're transformative reinterpreters, and in more than a few cases, flat-out miracle workers.\" Daft Punk also used vintage equipment to recreate sounds by older artists, such as the use of a Wurlitzer piano to evoke Supertramp on \"Digital Love\". They saw their style as retrofuturist, incorporating genres from earlier decades into what the New York Times described as \"an increasingly grand vision of joyful populism\".\nIn the early 1990s, Daft Punk drew inspiration from rock and acid house in the UK. Homem-Christo referred to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as the record that \"put everything together\" in terms of genre. In 2009, Bangalter named Andy Warhol as one of Daft Punk's early influences. On the Homework track \"Teachers\", Daft Punk list musicians who influenced them, including the funk musician George Clinton, the rapper and producer Dr Dre, and Chicago house and Detroit techno artists including Paul Johnson, Romanthony and Todd Edwards. Homem-Christo said: \"Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions—the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul—is part of how we sound today.\"\nDiscovery integrates influences from 70s disco and 80s crooners, and featured collaborations with Romanthony and Edwards. A major inspiration was the 1999 Aphex Twin single \"Windowlicker\", which Bangalter said was \"neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track\". For the Tron: Legacy soundtrack, Daft Punk drew inspiration from Wendy Carlos, the composer of the original Tron film, as well as Max Steiner, Bernard Herrmann, John Carpenter, Vangelis, Philip Glass and Maurice Jarre. For Random Access Memories, Daft Punk sought a \"west coast vibe\", referencing acts such as Fleetwood Mac, the Doobie Brothers and the Eagles, and the French electronic musician Jean Michel Jarre.\nMany Daft Punk songs feature vocals processed with effects and vocoders including Auto-Tune, a Roland SVC-350 and the Digitech Vocalist. Bangalter said: \"A lot of people complain about musicians using Auto-Tune. It reminds me of the late '70s when musicians in France tried to ban the synthesiser. They said it was taking jobs away from musicians. What they didn't see was that you could use those tools in a new way instead of just for replacing the instruments that came before. People are often afraid of things that sound new.\"\n\n\n=== Image ===\nFor most public and media appearances, Daft Punk wore costumes that concealed their faces. Bangalter said they wanted the focus to be on their music, and that masks allowed them to control their image while retaining their anonymity and protecting their personal lives. He said that the 1974 film Phantom of the Paradise, in which the main character prominently wears a mask, was \"the foundation for a lot of what we're about artistically\". Daft Punk were also fans of the 1970s band Space, who wore space suits with helmets that hid their appearance. The mystery of Daft Punk's identity and their elaborate disguises added to their popularity.  \nDaft Punk wore masks during promotional appearances in the 1990s. Although they allowed a camera crew to film them for a French arts program at the time, Daft Punk did not speak on screen. According to Orla Lee-Fisher, the head of marketing at Virgin Records UK, in their early career Daft Punk would only consent to photographs without masks while they were DJing. In 1997, Bangalter said they had a rule to not appear in videos.\n\nIn 2001, Daft Punk began wearing robot costumes for promotional appearances and performances for Discovery, debuted in a special presentation during Cartoon Network's Toonami block. The helmets were produced by Paul Hahn of Daft Arts and the French directors Alex and Martin, with engineering by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc. They were capable of various LED effects. Wigs were originally attached to both helmets, but Daft Punk removed them moments before unveiling them. Bangalter said the helmets were hot but that he became used to this. Later helmets were fitted with ventilators to prevent overheating. The costumes were compared to the makeup of Kiss and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. \nWith the release of Human After All, Daft Punk wore simplified helmets and black leather jackets and trousers designed by Hedi Slimane. Bangalter said Daft Punk did not want to repeat themselves and were interested in \"developing a persona that merges fiction and reality\". On the set of Electroma, Daft Punk were interviewed with their backs turned, and in 2006 they wore cloth bags over their heads during a televised interview. They said the use of cloth bags had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their image. Daft Punk wore their robot costumes in their performances at the 2008, 2014, and 2017 Grammy Awards. During the 2014 ceremony, they accepted their awards on stage in the outfits, with Pharrell and Paul Williams speaking on their behalf.\nDaft Punk used the robot outfits to merge the characteristics of humans and machines. Bangalter said that the personas were initially the result of shyness, but that they became exciting for the audience, \"the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower\". He described it as an advanced version of glam, \"where it's definitely not you\". After Daft Punk's split, Bangalter likened the robot personas to a \"like a Marina Abramović performance art installation that lasted for 20 years\". He denied that the robots represented \"an unquestioning embrace of digital culture\", and said: \"We tried to use these machines to express something extremely moving that a machine cannot feel, but a human can. We were always on the side of humanity and not on the side of technology.\"\n\n\n=== Media appearances ===\n\nDaft Punk's popularity has been partially attributed to their appearances in mainstream media. They appeared with Juliette Lewis in an advertisement for Gap, featuring the single \"Digital Love\", and were contractually obliged to appear only in Gap clothing. In 2001, Daft Punk appeared in an advertisement on Cartoon Network's Toonami timeslot, promoting the official Toonami website and the animated music videos for their album Discovery. The music videos later appeared as scenes in the feature-length film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, in which Daft Punk make a cameo appearance as their robot alter-egos. They appeared in a television advertisement wearing their Discovery-era headgear to promote Sony Ericsson's Premini mobile phone. In 2010, Daft Punk appeared in Adidas advertisements promoting a Star Wars clothing line. Daft Punk made a cameo in Tron: Legacy as nightclub DJs.\n\nIn 2011, Coca-Cola distributed limited edition bottles designed by Daft Punk. Daft Punk and Courtney Love were photographed for the \"Music Project\" of the fashion house Yves Saint Laurent. They appeared in their new sequined suits custom-made by Hedi Slimane, holding and playing instruments with bodies made of lucite. In 2013, Bandai released Daft Punk action figures coinciding with the release of Random Access Memories in Japan. Daft Punk made a rare public appearance at the 2013 Monaco Grand Prix in May on behalf of the Lotus F1 Team, who raced in cars emblazoned with the Daft Punk logo.\nFootage of Daft Punk's 2006 performance at the Coachella Festival was featured in the documentary film Coachella: 20 Years in the Desert, released on YouTube in April 2020. Daft Punk were scheduled to appear on 6 August 2013 episode of The Colbert Report to promote Random Access Memories, but this was canceled because of contractual obligations regarding their appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk were unaware of the agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. In 2015, Daft Punk appeared alongside several other musicians to announce their co-ownership of the music service Tidal at its relaunch.\nEden, a 2014 French drama film, has as its protagonist a techno fan-turned-DJ-turned recovering addict. It features Daft Punk (portrayed by actors) during different stages of their careers. Daft Punk are set to appear in Pharrell Williams's 2024 biographical film Piece by Piece.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nDaft Punk are regarded as one of the most influential dance acts. The chief Guardian music critic Alexis Petridis named them the most influential pop artists of the 21st century. Their collaborator Pharrell Williams said they were responsible for the rise of contemporary EDM, though Bangalter was noncommittal about this, saying only that other acts were using \"gimmicks that at the time [Daft Punk used them] were not really gimmicks\". The New York Times credited Daft Punk with helping make dance music mainstream. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Daft Punk the 12th-greatest musical duo. In 2008, Daft Punk were voted the 38th-greatest DJs in a worldwide poll by DJ Mag.\nIn \"Losing My Edge\", the first single by LCD Soundsystem, the singer James Murphy jokingly bragged about being the first to \"play Daft Punk to the rock kids\". LCD Soundsystem also recorded the song \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House\", which reached No. 29 in the UK and was nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 2006 Grammy Awards.\nDaft Punk tracks have been sampled or covered by other artists. \"Technologic\" was sampled by Swizz Beatz for the Busta Rhymes song \"Touch It\". In a later remix of \"Touch It\" the line \"touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it, turn it, leave it, start, format it\" from \"Technologic\" was sung by the rapper Missy Elliott. Kanye West's 2007 song \"Stronger\" from the album Graduation borrows the melody and features a vocal sample of Daft Punk's \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". Daft Punk's robotic costumes appeared in the music video for \"Stronger\". The track \"Daftendirekt\" from Daft Punk's album Homework was sampled for the Janet Jackson song \"So Much Betta\" from her 2008 album Discipline.\nThe track \"Aerodynamic\" was sampled for Wiley's 2008 single \"Summertime\". \"Veridis Quo\" from Discovery was sampled for the Jazmine Sullivan song \"Dream Big\" from her 2008 album Fearless. Daft Punk's \"Around the World\" was sampled for JoJo's 2009 song \"You Take Me (Around the World)\". The song \"Cowboy George\" by the Fall contains a clip of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". The a cappella group Pentatonix performed a medley of Daft Punk songs. As of November 2021, the video had been viewed over 355 million times.

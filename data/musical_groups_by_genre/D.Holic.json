In February 2017, it was confirmed through a performance that members Hami and Hwajung had departed from the group. They were temporary replaced with new members, Nayoung and Youjin, although they never officially made their debut. In July 2017, EJ announced that she would be leaving the group to pursue a modelling career. The group informally disbanded after the departure of all but one member, with the aim of re-debuting the remaining member, Rena, into a new girl group within a year. The group has released one mini-album: Chewy (2015) and three single albums: D.Holic Dark With Dignity (2014), Murphy & Sally (2015), and Color Me Rad (2016).\n\n\n== Former members ==\nNine (나인)\nDanbee (단비)\nDuri (두리)\nHami (하미) [Xu Xiaohan (Chinese: 许晓晗)]\nRena (레나)\nHwajung (화정)\nEJ (이제이)\nNayoung (나영)\nYoujin (유진)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Single albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

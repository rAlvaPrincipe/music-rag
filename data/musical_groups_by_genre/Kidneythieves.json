    "text": "Kidneythieves are an American industrial rock duo from Los Angeles, California. It was founded in 1997 by vocalist Free Dominguez  and guitarist/engineer Bruce Somers, and throughout their existence have worked with a revolving door of session musicians and live band members. After releasing two albums, Trickster (1998) and Zerøspace (2002), Kidneythieves went on hiatus in late 2004, but regrouped again in late 2007.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1998, Kidneythieves released their first single, \"S+M (A Love Song),\" as well as their first album, Trickster. They followed up their initial releases with the remix EP Phi in the Sky in 2001, and their second album Zerøspace in 2002. The album's title track was released as a single. Their song \"Before I'm Dead\" was featured in the 2002 film Queen of the Damned. In 2004, they re-released Trickster as Trickstereprocess, with digitally remastered tracks, five bonus tracks and a bonus DVD. After the release of Trickstereprocess, Free Dominguez went on to create an indie project while Bruce Somers created the band ShockNina.\nIn January 2007, Dominguez sent out a newsletter via email stating that she and Somers were collaborating once again on brand new Kidneythieves material. Mid-2010 saw the release of their long-awaited third album, Trypt0fanatic.\nIn 2011 Kidneythieves released a 5-track EP, The Invisible Plan. (Both Trypt0fanatic & The Invisible Plan are only available on CD through the band's official website store, also including a pre-order bonus track for each release).\nIn December 2015, the band launched a Kickstarter to fund their new album, The Mend, which was released in September 2016.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\n\nFree Dominguez - vocals, songwriting (1998–2004, 2007–present)\nBruce Somers - guitars, programming, production, instruments, songwriting (1998–2004, 2007–present)\nTouring members\n\nChristian Dorris - bass (1998–2004); drums (2007–2008)\nMoni Scaria - guitars (2001–2004, 2007–2009)\nJon Siren - drums (2008)\nChris Schleyer - guitars (1998–2001)\nMirv Douglas - bass (2011–2014)\nSean Sellers - drums, percussion (1998–2004)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nTrickster (1998)\nZerøspace (2002)\nTrypt0fanatic (2010)\nThe Mend (2016)\nRemastered albums\n\nTrickstereprocess (2004)\n\n\n=== EPs and special editions ===\nPhi in the Sky (2001)\nThe Invisible Plan (2011)\nLick U Clean E4M (2011)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nKidneythieves Live in Chicago 2002 (2002)\nTrack Listing\n\nTake a Train (Intro)\nBlack Bullet\nTaxicab Messiah\nBefore I'm Dead\nCrazy\nGlitter Girl\nZerospace\nDyskrasia\nBefore I'm Dead Acoustic\nRed & Violet\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nS+M (A Love Song) (1998)\nZerospace (2002)\nFreeky People (2010)\n\n\n== Media appearances ==\n\n\n=== Soundtrack contributions ===\nBride of Chucky (1998)\n\"Crazy\" (cover of a Willie Nelson song made popular by Patsy Cline)\nQueen of the Damned (2002)\n\"Before I'm Dead\"\nDissidia 012 Final Fantasy (2011)\n\"God in Fire\"\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance (2013)\n\"A Stranger I Remain\"\n\n\n=== Television series ===\nFirst Wave (TV series) (1998)\n\"S&M (a Love Song)\" in Episode 10, Marker 262\nWolf Lake (2001)\n\"Black Bullet\" in Episode 1, Meat the Parents\nCSI: Miami (2003)\n\"Arsenal\" in Episode 209 (Season 2, Episode 09), Bait\nWarehouse 13 (2010)\n\"Taxicab Messiah\" in Season 2, Episode 2, Mild Mannered\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nSelected songs from the album Trickster were featured in Deus Ex: Invisible War.

In 2013, Free Dominguez sang on the soundtrack to Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance on the track A Stranger I Remain (Maniac Agenda Mix).\n\n\n=== Guest appearances and collaborations ===\nFree Dominguez has contributed vocals to the third Conjure One album, Exilarch on the song \"Run For Cover\", as well as on Beat Ventriloquists EP, Goodnight Memory on the song \"Unfolding\", and will collaborate with them again on their forthcoming debut album. In 2004, Free's vocals were also featured on a number of songs, including \"Geisha Superfly\", \"War of Love\", \"Invisible\", \"Kickstand\" & \"Rhinestone Halo\" which she wrote for \"The Insider project\", a joint venture project with Matt \"Dr.\" Fink of The Revolution and DJ Insider. Free's backing vocals can be heard on Zeromancer's album, Clone Your Lover on songs \"Flirt (with Me)\" & \"Houses Of Cards\". She sang the latter live on stage with Zeromancer in Germany. Free also fronted for Conjure One in Germany around the same time, then performed again with them in London shortly afterwards. (May 2010). Free Dominguez was featured on KMFDM's 2011 album, WTF?!, on the song, \"Take It Like A Man\". \nAside from collaborations, Free has released solo material, the first being her debut album, \"freedoming\", which is currently Sold Out. A music video, \"Questions & Lies\" was made too which sounded different from the album version being more upbeat, titled \"Questions & Lies (With Drums)\" later being released as part of the iTunes exclusive \"Freedoming - EP\". For her second solo effort she recorded many songs, which were to be released on the album, \"Core: A Zone\", which was postponed due to kidneythieves being brought back together, and has since been unreleased, however in 2006 Free released a taster of the album in the form of the 5-track \"Core: A Zone - EP\". Free also recorded a cover of \"Heart Of Gold\" during this time. In late 2011 and early 2012 Free performed solo gigs, as well as opening for Jimmy Gnecco. Free sent out newsletters indicating that her third solo album, \"Volcano + The Sea\" would get a Spring 2012 release, delighting many fans worldwide. Also she had been planning on repackaging a selection of songs from her first two solo records for sometime, and finally announced an early 2012 release for them.\nBruce Somers has been working with the band Good Charlotte on their live production for their current world tour. Bruce mastered the latest releases from Richard Patrick's band Filter as well as the latest CD's by former Marilyn Manson and current Rob Zombie guitarist John 5. Bruce composed the music for \"Coming Up Roses,\" a new film featuring Bernadette Peters. The feature was directed by Lisa Albright. Look for a theatrical release in 2011. Bruce recently composed the music for the 27th Northrop Grumman National Space Symposium.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nKickstarter for The Mend\n\"Reconfigured Kidney Thieves Rebounding With Extasy EP, New Album,\" Billboard, Dec. 15, 2001"

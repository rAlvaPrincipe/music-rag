    "text": "Moev is an electronic band based in Vancouver, British Columbia that recorded on Atlantic Records, Nettwerk Records, Go! Records and Cop International.\n\n\n== History ==\nMoev was formed in 1981 by Tom Ferris and Cal Stephenson. The band released an EP in 1982, and later that year the electro/techno pop album Zimmerkampf.\nIn an interview with Dean Russell at Lee's Palace back in the early 80's he explained what the name of the band meant. \nHe Stated that \" Mauve - M.A.U.V.E is a pretty purplish pink, and Moev - M.O.E.V. is the colour of insanity\"\nStephenson, along with early members Mark Jowett and Michela Arichiello, left the band before the recording of its best-known album Yeah Whatever in 1988. Kelly Cook, Anthony Valcic and Dean Russell contributed to the album, which combined dark, solemn, anthemic lyrics with disjointed beats, trickling electronics, and occasional spoken-word samples.  Singles from the album include \"Yeah Whatever\", \"Wanting\", and \"Crucify Me\", the only lyrics to which are \"Why would you / Crucify me?\" (Other than isolated spoken-word samples \"Properly sedated\", \"Take four red capsules, help is on the way\" and \"For the masses\", which are all taken from George Lucas' 1971 film THX 1138.)  \"Crucify Me\" rose to number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine's Top Dance Tracks.\nOver the band's lifetime, other members included Madeleine Morris, Julie Ferris and Drew Maxwell. In conjunction with Terry McBride, Jowett formed the record label Nettwerk to release the band's albums.\nSarah McLachlan sang backup on a few tracks on the Head Down album, including the tracks \"Head Down\", \"In & Out\", and \"Noise\".\nDean Russell died in 1994 of complications due to AIDS, and the band broke up.\nMichela Arrichiello (vocals) died in 2011.\nTom and Julie Ferris reformed Moev in 1999.\nIn January 2007 the latest incarnation of Moev, Tom and Julie Ferris, released the single \"A Thousand Lashes\" from a forthcoming album Ventilation, which was released January 19, 2010 as a download only album.\nJulie and Tom Ferris are also members of the Vancouver band Lazarazu with Kevin Kane of The Grapes of Wrath.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n Zimmerkampf  (1982) GO!

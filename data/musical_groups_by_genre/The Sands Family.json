And Ben ** For coverage of solo careers of some band members, see Tommy Sands and Colum Sands\n \n\nThe Sands Family is a Northern Irish musical family band originating from Mayobridge, County Down, Northern Ireland. Their repertoire largely consists of their own compositions as well as traditional Irish songs. The band is considered one of the most influential folk groups. It showcases the famous Northern Irish folk singer-songwriter Tommy Sands as lead singer and songwriter and his brothers Ben Sands, Colum Sands and Eugene Sands and sister Anne Sands. Eugene was killed in a car accident in 1975  and the formation became a 4-member band. Tommy, Colum and Ben Sands have also successful solo careers as singers and musicians.\nThe Sands came from a very musical and artistic family. Their parents both came from families of singers, musicians and storytellers and encouraged a love of Irish culture and tradition in their seven children, Mary, the eldest, Hugh, Ben, Tommy, Colum, Eugene and Anne. Their mother Bridie Connolly, was an accordionist, and the daughter of the 'Burren poet', Owen Connolly, and her mother was related to the Brontë family.\nThe Sands family grew up in farm on the Ryan Road, a townland of Ryan, near Mayobridge.  Their Céilidh house on the Ryan Road, in the foothills of the Mourne Mountains  was a focal point for Catholic and Protestant neighbours from nearby farms to enjoy music and craic.\nThe Sands Family started public performing in local halls and pubs, then they won a 'Folk Group' contest in \"Old Shieling Hotel\" in Raheny, Dublin. This led to booking in New York in early 1971 followed by further tours in the US and Canada. They also performed a Saint Patrick's Day concert appearance in Carnegie Hall. Their almost 4-decade touring career includes regular tours throughout continental Europe, especially Germany, as well as the UK and Ireland. One notable highlight was performing in Moscow's Luzhniki 'Olympic' Stadium. Since the early 2000s however, the Sands Family have restricted touring to an annual tour of Germany and Ireland.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nHope is in The Morning – Recorded \"live\" in Ravensburg and Obing, Germany in January 2000.\nFolk from the Mournes (1968) Outlet OAS 3004 (Ireland)\nFirst day and the second day, Autogram FLLP 501 (Germany)\nThe third Day, Autogram ALLP\\233 (Germany)\nAs I roved out.

    "text": "Jakarta is a French EDM and electro house production team, consisting of Danny Wild, Alan Pride, David Kane, and Dave King. Their work is available on Hypetraxx Records, and has been remixed by Mondotek. Their music is in the tribal house style, but with a childlike voice sung by Sirko Falke (AKA Dookey Mackey), who did other vocal work on other dance tracks during the time. Their most relevant tracks are \"Superstar\" and \"One Desire\", which did well on the French charts in 2008.\nTheir first single, \"One Desire\", was distributed by Airplay Records for France, Universal (Belgium, Spain), Dancestreet (Germany), Sony BMG (Mexico), TMC Nordic (Scandinavia), Magic Records (Poland), and Teta (Israel). \"One Desire\" stayed at number 2 on the charts for four months in 2008.\nThe group created two 3D animated video clips with characters that are mostly babies. Their main character is Totosse, a dancing baby with a red Mohawk haircut.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n== References =="

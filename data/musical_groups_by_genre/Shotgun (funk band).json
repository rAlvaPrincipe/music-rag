    "text": "Shotgun were an American funk band from Detroit, Michigan, that recorded six albums between 1977 and 1982.  They also had eight hit records on the Billboard R&B chart, the most successful being \"Don't You Wanna Make Love\" which reached #35 on the R&B chart in 1979. The band was formed by 24-Carat Black band members William Talbert, Tyrone Steels, Ernest Lattimore and Gregory Ingram.\nOf the band's 1977 debut album Shotgun, Dusty Groove said, \"This first album by Shotgun — one of the many major label funk groups who flourished briefly at the end of the 70s has a harder sound than most of this nature — with plenty of guitars in the mix, and an overall heavier sound than you'd expect from an effort of this type. In fact, there's almost a rock/funk kind of groove going on — one that would be more typical of early 70s crossover efforts on Epic, in the wake of Sly Stone and other artists like that.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nRichard Sebastian (trumpet)\nGreg Ingram (saxophone)\nBilly Talbert (keyboards, guitars)\nErnest Latimore (guitars, vocals)\nLarry Austin (bass)\nTyrone Steels (drums, vocals)\nLeslie Carter (percussion)\nRobert Resch (drums)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nShotgun (ABC 1977)\nGood, Bad & Funky (ABC 1978)\nShotgun III (ABC 1979)\nShotgun IV (MCA 1980)\nKingdom Come (MCA 1980)\nLadies Choice (Montage 1982)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of funk rock bands\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShotgun at discogs.com"

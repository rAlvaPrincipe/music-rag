    "text": "Mr. Smith & The B Flat Band is a London-based ska pop funk band. Led by the soulful tone of English vocalist, Ryan Smith, the group has appeared on T4 for Popworld and played the world-famous main stage at The Cavern Club in Liverpool. With infectious melodies, relatable lyrics, and well-balanced instrumental backings, the band is responsible for catchy tunes such as \"Stuff That Makes Me Smile\", \"Jackie Love\", and \"Them Two Girls\". They credit influences ranging from Marvin Gaye to George Michael for their unique sound.\nThe group stopped playing together in 2007.  Guitarist and producer Nigel R Glasgow, has since gone on to work with a number of artists and write for adverts and films through his company B Flat Productions.  He is currently touring with UK artist Ghostpoet.\n\n\n== Members ==\nNigel R Glasgow (Mr. B Flat) - guitar / producer\nRyan Smith (Mr. Smith) - lead vocals\nScarlett Rose -backing vocals\nSam Bremner - drums (now with The Evidents)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Myspace Page\nB Flat Productions"

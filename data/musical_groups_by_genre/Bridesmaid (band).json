    "text": "Bridesmaid are an instrumental stoner rock band from Columbus, Ohio consisting of two bass players and two drummers.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 2010, the band was initially a trio. The original members were Bob Brinkman and Scott Hyatt on bass guitars and Cory Barnt on drums. Barnt eventually moved and during the transition period both Ricky Thompson and Barnt were drummers and the larger sound inspired Brinkman and Hyatt to keep two drummers. Adam Boehm was added when Barnt left.\nEventually, Thompson left and Barnt returned maintaining the two bass and two drums lineup.\n\n\n=== Band members ===\nCurrent\nBob Brinkman, bass\nScott Hyatt, bass\nCory Barnt, drums\nAdam Boehm, drums\nPast\nRicky Thompson, drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSplits and Compilations\nSun Splitter/Bridesmaid Split 7\" (2011)\nHeavy Haze Wax Mage Records Collection 1 (2016)\nEPs\nDavy Jones Industrial Average (2011)\nFull-length LPs\nBreakfast At Riffany's (2013)\nInternational House Of Mancakes (2016)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBridesmaid at Bandcamp\nBridesmaid at Facebook\nBridesmaid at Blogspot"

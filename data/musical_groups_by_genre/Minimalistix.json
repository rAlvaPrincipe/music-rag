The group first gained mainstream recognition with the white label single, \"Struggle for Pleasure\" (a remix of the 1983 Wim Mertens track) in Belgium dance clubs. In 2000 the track reached the Top 10 of European radio dance tracks. Two of the group's singles reached the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart. \"Close Cover\" peaking at #12 and \"Magic Fly\" (remix of Space's 1977 hit) at #36. Meanwhile \"Struggle For Pleasure\" reached #38 in the Dutch chart, and \"Close Cover\" made #34.\nMinimalistix's first album, Elements, was released in 2002.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2000 \"Struggle for Pleasure\" [Sphear]\n2000 \"Voices for Jana\" [Sphear]\n2001 \"A Forest\" [Sphear]\n2001 \"A Forest (Remixes)\" [Sphear]\n2001 \"Close Cover\" [Sphear]\n2001 Twin Peaks Theme \"Falling\" [Sphear]\n2002 \"Close Cover\" - Progressive and Hard Trance Mixes [Sphear/Data]\n2002 \"Magic Fly\" [Mostiko]\n2003 \"Magic Fly (Remixes)\"\n2007 \"Whistling Drive\" (aka Young Folks) [The Dance Division/Liberator Music]\n2007 \"Whistling Drive\" / \"Struggle for Pleasure\" [Hardstylers/Mostiko]\n2008 \"Code to Blue (MP3 release)\n2010 \"Ashk\"\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2002 Elements [Moskito]\n2002 Tranthem - Mixed By Minimalistix [Superb Trax]\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n2000 The Traveler & In Motion \"Believe\" [Five AM]\n2000 Trancid \"I Would Stay\" [Sphear]\n2001 Lost Witness \"Did I Dream\" (Song to the Siren)\" [Data]\n2001 Montini \"The Sound of Innocence Goes On\" [Sphear]\n2002 Tillmann Uhrmacher \"On the Run\" [Telstar TV]\n2002 Flesh & Bones \"My Time Has Come\" [Mostiko]\n2002 Posion I.V. \"Adagio for Strings\" [Sony Music Entertainment]\n2002 CREA & D.A.I. \"Free And Easy\" [Avex Trax]\n2002 DJ Sammy \"Sunlight\" [Polystar]\n2002 4 Strings \"Diving\" [Poylstar]\n2002 Sushi \"The Earthshaker\" [Bang On!]\n2002 Flesh & Bones \"I Love You\" [Telstar TV]\n2002 DJ Gert \"Give Me Some More\" [Y2K]\n2002 Kira \"I'll Be Your Angel\" [Multiply]\n2002 Redd Square ft.

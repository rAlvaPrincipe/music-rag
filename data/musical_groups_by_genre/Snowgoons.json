    "text": "Snowgoons is a German underground hip hop production team composed of DJ Illegal (Manuu Rückert) and Det Gunner (D. Keller). In 2011, producers Sicknature (Jeppe Andersen) from Denmark and J.S. Kuster (Johann Sebastian Kuster) from Germany joined the group. \n\n\n== History ==\nDet and DJ Illegal first started in 1999 as the two original members. In 2006, they decided to add a third  member, Torben from Germany, who was a part of the group until 2008. After Torben left, they decided to add a third member again in the same year, DJ Waxwork from Germany, who was a part of the group until 2009.\nThe Snowgoons are known for using orchestral/epic samples and for working with underground MCs, like members of Wu-Tang Clan, AOTP, Boot Camp Click and La Coka Nostra. The team cite DJ Premier, Alchemist and RZA as influences. They have released several Snowgoons albums. They also did several collaboration albums with artists like Reef the Lost Cauze, M.O.P., PMD and Sean Strange (as Goondox) and Onyx. They planned to release an album with the hiphop group Krush Unit for several years, but the album was never released. \nIn 2011, they launched their own record label called Goon MuSick.\nIn 2020, J.S. Kuster departed from Snowgoons and then started to go by the name Tengo and formed a duo rap group with the German rapper named BX under the name “Tengo & BX”.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nCurrent members\n\nDet Gunner (1999–present)\nDJ Illegal (1999–present)\nSicknature (2011–present)\nFormer members\n\nTorben (2006–2008)\nDJ Waxwork (2008–2009)\nJ.S.

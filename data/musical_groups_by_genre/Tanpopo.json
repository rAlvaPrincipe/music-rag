    "text": "Tanpopo (タンポポ, lit. \"Dandelion\") was a sub-group of the Japanese idol girl group Morning Musume and associated with Hello! Project. It was formed by Up-Front Promotion in November 1998 as Morning Musume's first sub-group. While the main group Morning Musume features predominantly upbeat songs with a fast tempo,  Tanpopo featured slower tempo, sentimental and retro-style songs.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was founded in November 1998, consisting of three Morning Musume members: Aya Ishiguro, Kaori Iida, and Mari Yaguchi. After the formation, the group immediately released their first single, \"Last Kiss,\" which was used on the anime Sorcerous Stabber Orphen. The single has a \"sexy\" vibe that they used on their second single and first album. However, they created a fresh image when they released \"Tanpopo\". This new image did not become as popular as the first image they had created.\nAfter the release of the group's fourth single, Aya Ishiguro graduated from Morning Musume and left the group. The remaining members continued performing their songs in concerts as Generation 1.5 Tanpopo.\nIn June 2000, Morning Musume 4th Generation members Rika Ishikawa and Ai Kago joined Tanpopo, making the two-member group a four-member group. The style of their songs changed also when the four released \"Otome Pasta ni Kandō.\" The style of this song became analogous to the songs Morning Musume had released. They also used this style on their next singles, which became popular and reached the number one spot on Oricon, and their second (and last) album.\nOn July 31, 2002, it was announced that Tanpopo was going to be completely reformed. Kaori Iida, Mari Yaguchi, and Ai Kago graduated from the group and were replaced by Morning Musume 5th Generation members Asami Konno and Risa Niigaki, with Ayumi Shibata of Melon Kinenbi. This newly formed group only released one single before they went on indefinite hiatus. All members except Niigaki graduated from Hello! Project as part of the Elder Club graduation concert in early 2009, rendering the group completely inactive.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== First generation ===\nAya Ishiguro (石黒彩)\nKaori Iida (飯田圭織)\nMari Yaguchi (矢口真里)\n\n\n=== Second generation ===\nKaori Iida (飯田圭織, Leader)\nMari Yaguchi (矢口真里)\nRika Ishikawa (石川梨華)\nAi Kago (加護亜依)\n\n\n=== Third generation ===\nRika Ishikawa (石川梨華, Leader)\nAsami Konno (紺野あさ美)\nRisa Niigaki (新垣里沙)\nAyumi Shibata (柴田あゆみ)\n\n\n=== Shuffle ===\nEri Kamei (亀井絵里, Leader)\nAika Mitsui (光井愛佳)\nYurina Kumai (熊井友理奈)\nChisato Okai (岡井千聖)\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nIn 2009, Tanpopo was revived as a Hello!

The sharp symbol was chosen to represent the kanji \"井\", which is the second character in each of the new members' surnames. The group released songs for Hello!

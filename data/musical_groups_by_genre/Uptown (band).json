The group's four original members were Chris Jung, Carlos Galvan, Steve Kim and Tasha Reid.\nThe group underwent several line-up changes during the 90s and disbanded in 2000 following drug charges against Jung, Galvan, and Kim.

Jung was the only remaining original member on the group's 2009 album, New Era, which featured new members Maniac, Snacky Chan, and Swings.

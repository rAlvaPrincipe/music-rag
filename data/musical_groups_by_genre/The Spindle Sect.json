    "text": "The Spindle Sect is an alternative metal band originally from Cape Town, South Africa, now based in the United Kingdom. They combine alternative metal, hip hop and various heavy subgenres, such as metalcore and hardcore punk, with elements of various electronic bass music genres, such as breakbeat, big beat, electronica, trance, industrial, drum and bass and dubstep.\nThe band played a key role in the revival of the live music scene in Cape Town circa 2002, drawing sell out crowds to their debut shows and often cited as \"ahead of their time\".\nAfter the band's relocation to the UK, they quickly earned themselves a spot on the Feedme Music roster alongside One Minute Silence, Senser, The Algorithm and Starseed. This led to the band supporting Ill Niño and Breed 77 at Kick Out The Jams Festival, two national tours with Hed PE and Senser, respectively, and a slot at Guernsey Festival alongside Hadouken. The band has since been playlisted on national radio with XFM, Kerrang!, and TotalRock Radio (Bloodstock Radio).\n2012 saw the release of the band's debut album Bubonic Tronic, which was mixed in L.A. by Dave Schiffman and mastered by Howie Weinberg.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nDarren Carikas – bass, programming, synthesizer\nGarreth Carikas – lead vocals, programming, synthesizer\nJerry Sudowski – drums\nAndy Czaplewski – guitars\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\"Episode One\" (2004)\nIs Your Planet Safe?

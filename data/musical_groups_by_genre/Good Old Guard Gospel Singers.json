They also play in a group called Defiance Stringband.\n\n\n== EnCana Controversy ==\nA song, EnCana Bluegrass Blues (a takeoff on the Dillards song, Old Home Place), written and performed by the Good Old Guard Gospel Singers, was critical of development and pollution said to have been caused by the EnCana Corporation.

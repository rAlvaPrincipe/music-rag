    "text": "Violadores del Verso (Spanish: Lyrical Molesters or Verse Rapists), formerly also known as Doble V, are a rap music group from Spain. \n\n\n== History ==\nVioladores del Verso was started in 1997 in Zaragoza, Spain by David Gilaberte (Lírico), Sergio Rodriguez (Sho-Hai/Hate), Rubén Cuevas (R de Rumba) and brothers Javier (Kase.O) and Sergio Ibarra (Brutal). \nThey released their first LP Genios in 1999. In 2001 they released two further albums as Doble V, a name they used until asked to desist to avoid association with Doble V whisky, a trademark owned by the Pernod Ricard drinks concern. In 2006, they released their fourth LP Vivir para contarlo, which went gold after ten days. In 2007 the group won the regional award for Spain in the MTV Europe Music Awards. \nThe group has been on hiatus since 2010 while its members pursue solo projects. The group's last concert before the pause was aired in August 2011 as a 3D transmission by national TV broadcaster Televisión Española (TVE), to pilot of the 3D technology involved.\nIn 2022, the group rejoined to record the track Únicos that appeared on Sho-Hai's solo album Polvo.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nVioladores del verso (Bufank Records, 1997)\nVioladores del verso (EP) (Avoid Records, 1998)\nVioladores del Verso presentan a Kase-O en: Mierda (Maxi) (Avoid Records, 1998)\nGenios (LP) (Avoid, 1999)\nAtrás (Maxi) (Rap Solo, 2001)\nVioladores del Verso + Kase-O Mierda (Reissue, (Boa Music, 2001)\nVicios y Virtudes (LP) (Rap Solo/Boa Music, 2001)\nTú eres alguien/Bombo clap (live DVD) (Rap Solo/Boa Music, 2002)\nVivir para contarlo / Haciendo lo nuestro (Maxi) (Rap Solo/Boa Music, 2006)\nGira 06/07 Presente (LP/DVD) (Rap Solo/Boa Music, 2007)\n\n\n== See also ==\nSpanish hip hop\nSFDK\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Spanish)"

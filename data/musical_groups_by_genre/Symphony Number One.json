SNO performs each year in musical venues in Mount Vernon, Baltimore, at Morgan State University, and across the city. Jordan Randall Smith is Symphony Number One's founder and current music director.\n\n\n== History ==\nSymphony Number One was founded in 2015 by Jordan Randall Smith, Nicholas Bentz, and Sean Meyers, all of whom were graduate and undergraduate students at the Peabody Institute. Symphony Number One is a chamber orchestra devoted to performing works by emerging composers. A non-profit performing arts organization, SNO maintains close relationships with the other independent classical music organizations of Baltimore, and is a part of Maryland's classical arts space. With its focus on contemporary music, SNO can also be classified as a contemporary classical ensemble.\nThe orchestra's president is Dr. Janan Broadbent and Ben Goldberg is SNO's composer-in-residence. The orchestra's current concertmaster is Nikita Borisevich. Founder Jordan Randall Smith and co-founder Nicholas Bentz are current members of the collective.

In 2017, SNO appointed Brian Tracey as executive director.\nSNO was invited to perform at the inaugural Light City festival on April 2, 2016, in Baltimore.

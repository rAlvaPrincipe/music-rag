    "text": "Skrew is an American industrial metal band. Formed in 1990 and disbanded in 1998, the group announced its return in 2009.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSkrew was formed in 1990 in Austin, Texas, by Adam Grossman and Danny Lohner.  The band emerged from the demise of crossover thrash band Angkor Wat, of which Grossman and Lohner were members. Skrew recruited Al Jourgensen of Ministry, to record and produce its 1991 debut album Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame. The album fared well commercially (out-selling every debut on the Metal Blade catalog) and received high praise from critics. It was during this period that Lohner left the band initially auditioning for the Red Hot Chili Peppers before being hired by Nine Inch Nails.\nSkrew proceeded to work on its second release, Dusted, which was released in 1994. This album saw the addition of keyboardist Jim Vollentine, who would remain with the band until 1998. Like its predecessor, Dusted was highly praised by critics and fans, and is still considered a classic in field of industrial metal by many fans of the genre. Commercially, however, it was less successful than Burning.\nThe band's music then underwent significant change, probably due to a head-on automobile collision that Grossman experienced in 1995, the result of which was the 1996 album Shadow of Doubt. The album largely moved away from the band's previous sound, featuring more of a slow, extreme thrash metal sound somewhat similar to other 1990s metal bands such as Machine Head. The band went through several member changes in the next year, but by 1997, Grossman had a stable line-up and released the band's final album, Angel Seed XXIII, which featured a style somewhat reminiscent of the then-emerging nu metal genre. The album received even less attention than its predecessor due to a lack of support from their label. Skrew went on hiatus in 1998.\nIn late 2009, Grossman began putting the pieces of Skrew back together again. The reformed band debuted on February 12, 2011, in Austin, Texas with a follow-up appearance in March 2011 at the SXSW music festival. The new material was much more politically oriented in terms of lyrics and musically might be more comparable to the Scandinavian extreme metal scene, all the while maintaining the roots of their distinctive sound.\nIn July 2014, Skrew digitally released Universal Immolation, their first album in 17 years. Worldwide touring commenced in 2015.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nAdam Grossman – vocals, guitars, programming (1990–1998, 2009–present)\nRicktor Ravensbrück – guitars (2014–present)\nLaurent Le Baut – drums (1990–1998, 2009–present)\n\n\n=== Former ===\nDanny Lohner – guitars, vocals (1990–1991)\nRick Weir – keyboards, programming (1990–1991)\nTony Maingot – keyboards, programming (1990–1991)\nDusty Kohn – guitar\nMyke Bingham – bass\nMike Robinson – guitars\nClay Campbell – guitars\nBobby Gustafson – guitars (1996)\nMike Peoples – bass\nBrandon Workman – bass\nRobb Lampmann – guitars\nChris Ault – keyboards, programming\nMark Dufour – drums\nChadwick Davis – bass\nEddie Travis – drums\nSteve \"Snake\" Green – guitars\nMarc \"Frap\" Frappier – bass\nJim Vollentine – keyboards, programming (1994–1998)\nBarry Adelman – drums\nChris Istas – drums\nKyle Sanders – bass\nPaul Gooch – programming\nJason Lindgren – guitars\nWilliam Ables – guitars\nDoug (Snide) Chapius – guitars\nBret Munk - guitars\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nBurning in Water, Drowning in Flame (1991, Metal Blade)\nDusted (1994, Metal Blade)\nShadow of Doubt (1996, Metal Blade)\nAngel Seed XXIII (1997, Metal Blade)\nUniversal Immolation (2014, Awesome Kickass Records)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Skrew | Biography & History\".

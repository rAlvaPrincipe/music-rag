    "text": "The Pastels are an indie rock group from Glasgow formed in 1981. They were a key act of the Scottish and British independent music scenes of the 1980s, and are specifically credited for the development of an independent and confident music scene in Glasgow. The group have had a number of members, but currently consists of Stephen McRobbie, Katrina Mitchell, Tom Crossley, John Hogarty, Alison Mitchell and Suse Bear.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\n\nThe group formed in 1981 amid the peak of the Postcard Records era of independent music in Glasgow. Brian Taylor, a friend at the time of Postcard's Alan Horne, recruited McRobbie, Hayward, and Simpson for his new band. The band first performed at Bearsden Burgh Hall, booked by McRobbie after he attended a Crass gig at the same venue.\nThe band released their first single, \"Songs for Children,\" on Whaam! Records in 1982, followed by their tape \"Entertaining Edward\" that same year on Action Tapes.\nThe band released a series of singles from 1982–1986, starting with \"Something Going On\" and B-side \"I Wonder Why\" in 1983. The latter record was later separately released by Rough Trade after McRobbie travelled to see Geoff Travis at the label's office in London, where he insisted that they were \"the next big thing out of Scotland.\" The band then released \"Million Tears\" in 1984, \"I'm Alright With You\" in 1985, and \"Truck Train Tractor\" in 1986, all on other labels after their relationship with Rough Trade declined as the label focused  more heavily on their other artists such as \"shinier new signings\" Scritti Politti and the Smiths.\nThese releases were published on a variety of labels including Whaam!, Creation, and Glass Records, and all had a raw and immediate sound, melodic and amateur, which seemed at odds with the time.\nDespite their contrarian musical approach, they soon enjoyed an emerging fanzine culture identified with the group's sound and image, and slowly started to influence a new wave of groups, as well as gathering the attention of NME and other UK media. Prior to their breakout album, the band appeared in a John Peel session, as well as a variety of zines. McRobbie at this period undertook a master's degree in librarianship at Glasgow University, which would ensure the band remained rooted in Glasgow during their newfound fame.\nThe Pastels' sound continued to evolve and, although part of NME's C86 compilation, in interviews they always sought to distance themselves from both twee and shambling developments.\n\n\n=== Up for a Bit with the Pastels ===\nTheir debut album, Up for a Bit with The Pastels (Glass, 1987; re-issue Paperhouse, 1991) moved from garage pop-punk through to ballads with synth orchestra splashes. The album launched to industry praise, with praise from acts including Jesus and Mary Chain, Primal Scream, Sonic Youth, Yo La Tengo, and Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, but the record did not \"set the world alight\" as some had expected. In 2003, it was named the 37th best Scottish album by The Scotsman. The Guardian describe the album as integral in helping \"to inspire confidence in the Glasgow scene (showing) that bands didn’t have to move south but could let the record industry come to them.\" The album is attributed by the paper as attributable to the later release of Glaswegian output including Belle and Sebastian's Tigermilk, Mogwai's Young Team, Franz Ferdinand's self-titled arrival, and even Chvrches.\n\n\n=== Departures and Sittin' Pretty ===\nThe band's 1989 follow-up, Sittin' Pretty (Chapter 22, 1989) was harder but less eclectic. Reports started to appear in the UK music press that the group was splitting up, and Taylor, Hayward and Simpson all departed.\nEventually it became clear that a new line-up was configuring around original members, McRobbie and Wright (Aggi), now joined by Katrina Mitchell. This line-up is probably the best known of The Pastels' various phases, and often featured either David Keegan (of Shop Assistants) or Gerard Love (of Teenage Fanclub) on guitar. They signed with the then emerging Domino Records and completed two albums, Mobile Safari (1995) and Illumination (1997), with the musical approach of the latter described as \"mellowed and evolved into a form of gently psychedelic off-kilter pop, adorned with orchestral instrumentation.\" A remix set featured My Bloody Valentine, Jim O'Rourke and others on the album, Illuminati (1998). The band also featured that year on the soundtrack for the film The Acid House.\nIn 2000, Wright left the group to focus on her career as an illustrator though she still provides artwork for the group. Their next release was the soundtrack to David Mackenzie's The Last Great Wilderness (Geographic, 2003). It featured a track recorded in collaboration with Pulp's Jarvis Cocker. In 2006 The Pastels developed and completed new music for a theatre production by Glasgow-based company, 12 Stars.\nDuring the early 2000s the band continued to receive attention, particularly in Japan where they became \"incongruously wrapped up in the hype surrounding Britpop in Japan, jostling for position in magazines with the likes of Blur and Manic Street Preachers.\"\nIn 2009, The Pastels, in collaboration with Tenniscoats from Tokyo, Japan, released an album called Two Sunsets, which critics called \"a playful, spontaneous and spellbinding must-hear.\"\nIn 2013 they released their first album proper in sixteen years, Slow Summits, again through Domino. The Guardian described the album as \"their most complete set since Up for a Bit, with its 10 summery, groovy flute and french-horn-licked songs, trippy in the sense of the kind of trip that lands in a pile of freshly mown grass.\" The album was shortlisted for the 2013 Scottish Album of the Year Award.\nThe Pastels now operate their own Geographic Music label through Domino, and are partners in Glasgow's Monorail Music shop.\nThe band features in the book Postcards From Scotland detailing the 1980's and 1990's independent music scene in Scotland.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nStephen McRobbie (or Stephen Pastel) – guitar, vocals (1981–present)\nKatrina Mitchell – drums, vocals, guitar, keyboards (1989–present)\nTom Crossley – flute, keyboards (1990s–present)\nAlison Mitchell – trumpet (2003–present)\nJohn Hogarty – guitar (late 2000s–present)\nSuse Bear – bass (2010s–present)\n\n\n=== Former ===\nBrian Taylor (or Brian Superstar) – guitar (1981–1992)\nMartin Hayward  – bass, vocals (1982–1989)\nBernice Simpson – drums (1983–1989)\nAnnabel Wright (or Aggi) – vocals (1984–2000), keyboards (1984–1990), bass (1990–2000)\nEugene Kelly – backing vocals, violin, guitar, autoharp (1987–1989)\nDavid Keegan – guitar (1992–2000)\nGerard Love – guitar / bass \nJonathan Kilgour – guitar (1994–1997)\nNorman Blake – guitar, bass\n\n\n=== Contributors ===\nGerard Love – guitar, bass guitar, drums\nNorman Blake – guitar, bass guitar, vocals\nColin McIlroy – guitar\nCharlie Dinsdale – drums\nChris Gordon – drums\nMichael Giudici – bass guitar\nSandy Forbes – drums\nDean Wareham – guitar\nMaureen McRoberts – saxophone\nDarren Ramsay – trumpet\nFrancis MacDonald – drums\nLiz Dew – bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nUp for a Bit with The Pastels (1987)\nSittin' Pretty (1989)\nMobile Safari (1995)\nIllumination (1997)\nSlow Summits (2013)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nSuck On (1988)\nTruckload of Trouble (1994)\nIlluminati (1998)\nSummer Rain (2013)\n\n\n=== Soundtracks ===\nThe Last Great Wilderness (2003)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== With Jad Fair ===\nJad Fair and The Pastels – This Could Be the Night EP (Paperhouse, 1991)\nJad Fair and The Pastels – No. 2 EP (Paperhouse, 1992)\n\n\n=== With Tenniscoats ===\nThe Pastels and Tenniscoats – Two Sunsets (Geographic, 2009)\nThe Pastels and Tenniscoats – Vivid Youth / About You (Geographic, 2009)\n\n\n=== With Sonic Youth ===\nThe Pastels and Sonic Youth – Sonic Youth and the Pastels Play The New York Dolls (Glass Modern, 2021)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCulture in Glasgow\nMusic of Scotland\nCreation (record label)\nGlass Records\nC86 compilation\nNME\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Pastels at AllMusic"

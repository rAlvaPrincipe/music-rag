    "text": "Tunng are an English folk music band. They are often associated with the folktronica genre, due to the electronic influences evident in some of their work. Tunng are often noted for their use of unconventional instruments, including seashells and percussive electronic samples.\n\n\n== History ==\nSam Genders and Mike Lindsay, two of the founding members of Tunng, began their musical careers together after meeting at one of Genders's early London solo gigs.\nBesides releasing five albums and numerous singles since 2004, Tunng have covered Bloc Party's song \"The Pioneers\". Both the original and cover were featured in the third season of The O.C. (\"The Man of the Year\", Episode 24).  They also covered Tim Buckley's \"No Man Can Find The War\" for the 2006 tribute album Dream Brother: The Songs of Tim and Jeff Buckley.\nThey supported Doves on dates at the end of their 2005 tour.  Member Becky Jacobs is the younger sister of electronic musician Max Tundra.\nIn 2007, the band were included on The Imagined Village album, with a retold version of \"Death and the Maiden\".  In 2008, Tunng remixed the song \"Hoko Onchi\" on Dive Index's Collisions – The Mid/Air Remixes. Their song \"Bullets\" was played during the end credits of the Weeds season four episode, \"Till We Meet Again\", in September 2008.\n\"Jenny Again\" from Comments of the Inner Chorus was used as the soundtrack for the TV ad from the NSPCC to launch the NSPCC Child's Voice Appeal.\nIn March 2009, Tunng played together with a trio from the Tuareg desert blues band Tinariwen on a UK tour, and they also played together at Glastonbury in June 2009 and 2010. In May 2010, Tunng headlined at the Wood Festival in Oxfordshire, England. Tunng's appearance at Truck Festival in July 2011 was their only UK performance of the summer.\nIn August 2011, Tunng remixed Gnomes by Sea of Bees. On 5 December 2011, the band released This Is Tunng ...

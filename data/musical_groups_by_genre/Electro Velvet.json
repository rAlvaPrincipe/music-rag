In the Eurovision final they received 5 points and were placed 24th out of 27.\nThe staging of the song included two pairs of additional dancers, two of whom performed breakdance and acrobatic moves. The television production involved some Busby Berkeley-style shots from above and darkened sequences during which the performers' costumes were illuminated with integral LED strip light.\nOn 22 June, their debut EP was launched on PledgeMusic where it was available to pre-order, along with many other exclusives. It was cancelled due to Nicholas' continued ill-health.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial PledgeMusic page\nOfficial Facebook page"

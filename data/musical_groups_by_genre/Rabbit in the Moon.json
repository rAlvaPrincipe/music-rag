    "text": "Rabbit in the Moon is an American electronic music group that formed in 1991. Their style draws from psychedelic trance, house music and breakbeat, along with other diverse influences. They were among the first to mix theatrical stage performance with rave music.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed in 1992 in Tampa, Florida, the group consisted of performer/singer Bunny and producer David Christophere. \nAfter several singles released on Monk and David Christophere's Hallucination Recordings label under the name Anarch-E, their first success as producers came in 1993 with the release of the \"Phases of an Out of Body Experience\" single on Hardkiss Records.  As remixers, Rabbit in the Moon has reworked songs by artists such as Garbage (\"Queer\" and \"Milk\"), Tori Amos (\"Precious Things\"), Sarah McLachlan (\"Fear\", \"Possession\"), Orbital (\"Are We Here?\"), Smashing Pumpkins (\"The End Is the Beginning Is the End\"), Goldie (\"Inner City Life\"), White Zombie (\"Blood, Milk and Sky\") and Delerium (\"Euphoria\").\nRabbit in the Moon has also collaborated with Humate and in 1994 they released the Hemispheres E.P.\nThroughout their career, Rabbit in the Moon toured extensively in the United States playing shows at venues and raves.\nIn 1999, Rabbit in the Moon performed in the first Ultra Music Festival.\nThe Rabbit in the Moon Remixes Volume 2 CD came with a liner note stating that there was a new album to be released in summer of 2001. The album never materialized. Because of Monk's departure, questions were raised as to whether the group was breaking up, but this was not the case.\n\n\n=== DJ Monk leaves ===\nDJ Monk left the group in 2002. A new song called \"Time Bomb\" surfaced in 2003, with David Christophere and Bunny as the only producers on the track.\nIn 2005, they made the song \"Came and Conkered\", inspired by and featured in the soundtrack of the 2005 video game Conker: Live & Reloaded. They were asked by Nile Rodgers to create music for the Xbox remake of the game.\nEarly in 2007, a countdown to a new album appeared on the band's MySpace page, putting the release date in April 2007. The album was ultimately released on July 10, 2007. It features two discs: one, a collection of past singles and newer material in audio CD format; the other, a collection of music videos and live performances from various festivals and concerts in DVD format. The record is called \"Decade\", and was released on Contagious Musiq / Southbeat Records.\nIn 2008, on the second night of the Annual World DJ Festival in Seoul, South Korea, frontman Bunny was injured when a glass bottle thrown by someone in the crowd hit his left eye, lacerating his retina, lens, and skin, and severely damaging his vision. Friends and fans throughout the electronic dance music community rallied to raise money to help him pay for his medical expenses.\nAs of 2010, Rabbit in the Moon announced on their MySpace page that they were working on a new double album.\nOn March 27, 2010, Rabbit in the Moon performed at the Ultra Music Festival in Miami. David Christophere was not seen at this show, fueling rumors he left the band and of an imminent band break up.  \nBunny has been performing in several countries under the title BUNNY or Bunny Live.\nDavid Christophere produces music and DJ from his home base in Los Angeles.\n\n\n=== Reunion ===\nOn August 31, 2013, the group played Firestone Live in Orlando, FL.\nOn December 16, 2015, Ultra Music Festival in Miami announced on their lineup of 2016 edition the appearance of Rabbit in the Moon. The group performed at Electric Daisy Carnival in Orlando in November, 2016.\nThe group played at Ultra Music Festival Miami  2017 and 2018. As well as Ultra Korea, Insomniac Countdown , Freaknight Seattle, and the great salt air Utah Das Energi festival.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\nOriginal productions and singles:\n\nOut of Body Experience/Freak to the Beat (Hallucination 12\") (1993)\nPhases of an Out Of Body Experience (Hardkiss 12\") (1994)\nUntitled/The EP that Never Was (Limited Edition Hallucination 12\") (1995)\nDeeper (Limited Edition Hallucination 12\") (1997)\nRabbit in the Moon Remixes Volume 1 (Hallucination 3x12\" and CD) (1998)\nAppears on 'For the Masses' Depeche Mode Tribute  (Waiting for the Night) (1998)\nFloori.d.a (Hallucination 2x12\" and CD Maxi) (1999)\nRabbit in the Moon Remixes Volume 2 (Hallucination 3x12\" and CD) (1999)\n9ine Eleven Dub (White Label) (2002)\nTime Bomb (Rabbit in the Moon Song)|Time Bomb (White Label) (2002)\nDecade (Rabbit in the Moon album)|Decade Southbeat Records (2007)\nBlue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday on Ceremony â€“ A New Order Tribute (24 Hour Service Station) (2009)\nPheet Original release (dec 2016)\nLet's Dance Remake release with live video (Jan 2017)\nSeven Loves Electro EP (Insomniac Music / Thumper Music - limited Release vinyl 12\" and Digital)(August 2017)\nVibration EP (January 2018)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nVelocity, \"Lust\" Desirable mix (Superstition)\nOrbital, \"Are We Here\" RITM's Oral Mix & Laconic Dub (London/FFRR)\nSarah McLachlan, \"Possession, Fear & Fear of Possession\" R.I.T.M. rmxs (Arista)\nGod Within, \"The Phoenix\" R.I.T.M. river & rain rmx (Hardkiss)\nAquarhythms, \"Heart Sequence\" RITMs Moveable Feast Mix ) (Astralwerks)\n(orig. released as Ether \"BodyJazz / Bodyfusion\" on Aquarhythms\nRabbit in the Moon/Humate, \"East\" R.I.T.M.'s southern stimulation (Superstition/RisingHigh)\nCosmic Baby, \"Cosmic Greets Florida\" R.I.T.M. greets berlin & 7 am pacific rmxs (Logic)\nNightripper, \"Tone Exploitation\" R.I.T.M. exploitation rmx (ESP)\nAstral Pilot, \"Electro Acupuncture\" RITM's Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (Harthouse)\nGarbage, \"Queer\" R.I.T.M.'s Heftybag mix and F.T.F.O.I. mix (Geffen/Almo Sounds)\nPlanet Soul, \"Set U Free\" R.I.T.M.'s Moon Spirits dub (Strictly Rhythm)\nGoldie, \"Inner City Life\" R.I.T.M. mixes (London/FFRR)\nWhite Zombie, \"More Human Than Human\" (Geffen)\nWhite Zombie, \"Blood, Milk & Sky\" RITM's Subterranean Mix (Geffen)\nGarbage, \"Stupid Girl\" (Geffen/Almo Sounds)\nKeoki, \"Caterpillar\" R.I.T.M.'s disco 2001 mix (Moonshine)\nBT & Tori Amos, \"Blue Skies\" R.I.T.M.'s Fathomless mix (Kinetic/Perfecto)\nGarbage, \"Milk\" R.I.T.M.'s Got It, Butchered Vegas and Udder mixes (Geffen/Almo)\nDelerium, \"Euphoria\" (firefly) R.I.T.M.'s Divine Gothic Disco Mix & Dub (Netwerk)\nHealy & Amos, \"Argentina\" R.I.T.M.'s Helium mix (Positiva)\nTDF (feat.

    "text": "The Divine Horsemen are an American punk/roots band founded in 1983 by Chris D. (Desjardins), formerly of L.A. punk rock band the Flesh Eaters. The band developed a distinctive (and at the time, very new) alt country- type sound. They took their name from a voodoo term; a worshiper who is possessed by loa during a ceremony is said to be being ridden by \"the divine horsemen\". The term was also used as a song title by the Flesh Eaters\nDesjardins re-worked several old songs by the Flesh Eaters, notably \"Poison Arrow\", and exercised his literary side by namechecking Chester Himes, Jim Thompson, Donald Goines, James Ellroy, Harry Crews, Ambrose Bierce and James Joyce amongst others on the track \"What Is Red\" from the Snake Handler LP.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nOther band members included Julie Christensen (Chris' then-wife), Matt Lee and Peter Andrus, as well as the Flesh Eaters stalwart Robyn Jameson. They were joined at times by members of L.A. punk bands like Kid Congo Powers of The Gun Club and the Cramps and Jeffrey Lee Pierce of The Gun Club. \nDivine Horsemen broke up in 1988. However, more than three decades later, the band reformed. A new album called Hot Rise of an Ice Cream Phoenix was released in 2021. Bitter End of a Sweet Night followed in 2023.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Note on Record Labels ===\nThe information below provides the record label at the time the album was released.

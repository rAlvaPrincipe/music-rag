The group's first appearance was the \"We Got It Goin' On\" remix by R&B group Changing Faces in 1995. Two years later the group released their debut album, Da Dirty 30, which featured two singles \"Just Another Case\" and \"Bubblin'\". After the release of the album, the group disbanded with Yogi becoming a hip hop producer when he joined Puffy Combs's Hitmen Production Team. After a long hiatus, The One Chadio resumed his career, this time as a solo artist, releasing an album titled Internal Insurgency and soon thereafter releasing an album titled External Insurgency. During an online interview, The One Chadio said he was working on another project titled And Still. The project titled And Still was released in May of 2023 on Digital Streaming Platforms and was produced entirely by Talat ILgar. Recently, The One Chadio stated he was finished with another project where he was bringing it back to his Boom Bap roots. The name of that project is The One Chadio.

That same day, their first album was released along with a music video for \"No Way\", the lead single. The album also included a second song, \"Oh My Boy\" (왜이래; Wae Irae, lit. \"Why This Way\"). The group made its debut on the music show M! Countdown on June 12. On July 30, promotions began for \"Oh My Boy\" with a performance on Show Champion. The next day, Bob Girls' album was re-released as Summer Repackage, with summer remixes of both songs.\nIn late 2014, Bob Girls participated in the first Chrome Family project, a single album titled 2014 Chrome Family – A Very Special Christmas . The album was released digitally on December 3, as well as a music video for the single, \"Love Christmas\".\nOn February 24, 2015, it was reported that member Jina was recently diagnosed with encephalitis and her contract with the label was terminated to undergo treatment.

    "text": "CCMC is a Canadian free improvisation group founded in 1974.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe CCMC was founded by Peter Anson, Graham Coughtry, Larry Dubin, Greg Gallagher, Nobuo Kubota, Allan Mattes, Casey Sokol, Bill Smith and Michael Snow. Three of the founding members (Graham Coughtry, Nobuo Kubota, and  Michael Snow) were members of Artists' Jazz Band, a seminal Toronto free-jazz ensemble. In 1976, the group founded The Music Gallery as an artist-run centre  where they performed twice-weekly. The group was formally associated with The Music Gallery until 2000. Members of the group were also founders of the Music Gallery Editions record label, which issued CCMC's first six albums.\nThe group remains active to the present day, though through its various incarnations Michael Snow has been the group's only constant member. The group currently performs as a quartet of Snow (piano/Octave Cat synthesizer), John Oswald (alto sax), Paul Dutton (soundsinging, mouth harp) and John Kamevaar (electronic percussion/electroacoustic sounds).\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nCCMC's music is based on \"improvisation-as-composition\" (p. 40)  inspired by free jazz.  \n\nWe came to it because... we wanted to create not only a new work or a new instrument, but a new composer, a six-brained, twelve-handed individual, to see what it would come up with.\nWith no pre-existing compositions, live performance is central to the band's identity, and their early recordings were all recorded live in concert. (\"Interviewer: Since the very beginning CCMC has recorded every concert, is that true? Michael Snow: Yes, that's, whatever it is, thirteen years of at least twice a week, plus all the tours. A lot of tape, yes.\"\n\nFrom 1974 until the early 1980s CCMC played at least two concerts a week, most of which took place in their own venue, The Music Gallery, in Toronto. The band was and continues to be a ‘free music orchestra’ devoted to spontaneous composition. One look at the cover of the Vol 1 LP and it’s apparent that CCMC are not your typical hippy free-rock group, slick-suited jazz cats, nor tweed academic weekend composers. In fact, CCMC never really look like typical musicians at all, but rather like visual artists, family men, scholars, Canucks, ecologists, sculptors and radical adults they are. Similarly, their sound can never really be pinned down in the way that other devotees of ‘free’ music usually are; never as dogmatic as AMM, as angry as American free jazz, as bleak as Japanese free jazz or as humorless as European free improv. CCMC are as comfortable playing toys and melodies as they were noise electronics and torrential freak-outs. In the truest sense CCMC were sonic explorers devoted to spontaneous free music, uninhibited by any restriction, be it melody, silence, genre, volume or instrumentation.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe abbreviation CCMC originally stood for Canadian Creative Music Collective. By 1978, and the release of the Volume Three LP, the group had collectively gathered several hundred alternate associations, many of which were reproduced as the cover art of that record.

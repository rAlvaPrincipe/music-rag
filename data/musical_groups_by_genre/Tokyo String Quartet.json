The founding members attended the Toho Gakuen School of Music in Tokyo, where they studied with Professor Hideo Saito. Soon after its formation the Quartet won First Prizes at the Coleman Competition, the Munich Competition and the Young Concert Artists International Auditions. This resulted in a recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon.\nThe quartet recorded over 40 albums, covering a wide range of classical music. They won the Grand Prix du Disque Montreux, \"Best Chamber Music Recording of the Year\" awards from both Stereo Review and Gramophone magazines, and seven Grammy nominations. In addition to Deutsche Grammophon, for many years they recorded for RCA Victor Red Seal, also for Angel-EMI, CBS Masterworks, and for the last decade for Harmonia Mundi.\nDuring their 25th anniversary international tour in 1994, the quartet performed the complete Beethoven String Quartets.\nOn television, the quartet appeared on \"Sesame Street,\" \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" PBS's \"Great Performances,\" \"National Arts,\" and a national broadcast from the Corcoran Gallery of Art.\nThe members of the quartet served on the faculty of the Yale School of Music from 1976.\nThe group played on a collection of instruments made by the famous luthier, Stradivari. The collection is known as the Paganini Quartet.\nThe quartet disbanded at the end of the 2013 season, following the decision by the violist Kazuhide Isomura, an original member, and the 2nd violinist Kikuei Ikeda to retire.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== First violin ===\n1969 Koichiro Harada\n1981 Peter Oundjian\n1995 Andrew Dawes\n1996 Mikhail Kopelman\n2002 Martin Beaver\n\n\n=== Second violin ===\n1969 Yoshiko Nakura\n1974 Kikuei Ikeda\n\n\n=== Viola ===\n1969 Kazuhide Isomura\n\n\n=== Cello ===\n1969 Sadao Harada\n2000 Clive Greensmith\n\n\n== References ==\n\nhttp://www.tokyoquartet.com/artist.php?view=bio\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nThe Tokyo String Quartet Performs In-depth essay on concert performance of 6 March 2011."

    "text": "Cindytalk is an experimental music project, founded in 1982. Cindytalk operated as a group for many years, but more recently has been a solo project by Cinder, a Scottish performer and the only constant member since 1982. Cinder was also credited as Gordon Sharp and Cindy Sharp. \n\n\n== 1982–2003 ==\nCindytalk was formed in 1982 by vocalist Cinder (then credited as Gordon Sharp) and David Clancy (guitar, keyboards; formerly of Edinburgh-based punk/new wave band The Freeze).\nAfter re-locating to London in 1982, Cindytalk began to work towards their debut album Camouflage Heart, with a darker and more fractured sound that drew much from post-punk and early European industrial music. In 1983 Cinder and Clancy were joined by John Byrne who proved to be a crucial component in Cindytalk's deliberately disintegrating sound.\nThe album Camouflage Heart appeared to some critical acclaim in the UK music press. Shortly after Camouflage Heart, David Clancy left the band and was replaced by brother/sister team Alex and Debbie Wright. The colossal In This World was recorded over the next three years: two albums of the same name released simultaneously, featuring cover art by Kathy Patterson. The first of the albums, a broken and noisy affair, the second, an album of creaky ambience featuring Cinder's improvised piano experiments. In This World also featured an uncredited collaboration with feminist punk writer Kathy Acker (Janey's Love).\nDuring this period Cindytalk had also begun working in tandem with performance artist and film maker Ivan Unwin, providing sound for some of her short pieces. This led Cindytalk to scoring Unwin's \"Eclipse: An Amateur Enthusiasts Guide to Virus Deployment\", the record of which was released on Midnight Music in 1990 under the title The Wind Is Strong..., the album, following on from the second of the In This World albums, was based on piano improvisations and abstract/concrete experiments. At the time Cinder described it as \"Ambi-dustrial\" fusing her love of the early ambient releases on the EG label with the above-mentioned European Industrial music. Cinder was joined on this release by Ivan Unwin and long standing co-producer/engineer David Ros who then became a more active member of the band. Matt Kinnison and drummer/percussionist Paul Middleton also provided sounds and ideas to this mix. Secrets And Falling, a 4-track e.p. culled from the Wappinschaw sessions was released in 1991. At this point the band had become more of a collective, drawing on musicians from the current line-up as well as the past, John Byrne returned and was joined by Kevin Rich and Darryl Moore (Soul Static Sound).\nMidnight Music folded in 1992 and prevented the recently finished album Wappinschaw from being released until 1995 (on Cinder's own label Touched, distributed through World Serpent). Wappinschaw features a collaboration with Scottish artist and writer Alasdair Gray, who reads from his novel \"Lanark\" (Wheesht).\nBy 1993, Cindytalk had gone through more changes and was preparing to play live for the first time. Cinder, Middleton and Ros were joined by Paul Jones, Andie Brown, Mark Stephenson and Simon Carmichael to record and release 1994's \"Muster\"/\"Prince of Lies\" 7\" (Touched/World Serpent).\nIn early 1996, Cindytalk toured the US. They played two shows in Boston – one a \"secret\" show at the start of their tour under the name \"Lucinder\", and one at the end. In between, they played Washington DC, Cleveland, Detroit, Minneapolis, Portland OR, Seattle, Santa Clara, San Francsisco, Corona CA, Tempe AZ, Baton Rouge, Atlanta, Orlando, Miami, Charlotte NC and New York City. Bowery Electric and Trance to the Sun were opening acts at multiple dates.\nIn 2007, Cindytalk signed a licensing deal with Italian distributors Abraxas through a sub-label Wheesht, who were to re-issue the back catalogue up to Wappinschaw. However, this deal appears to have gone awry with Abraxas releasing the first two Cindytalk albums Camouflage Heart and In This World without complying with the contract. In 2021, Dais Records (USA) re-issued The Wind Is Strong... and Wappinschaw.\n\n\n== 2003 to present ==\n2003's Klang Galerie 7\" release \"Transgender Warrior/Guts of London\" saw Cindytalk move into more abstract areas, taking a closer look at the rhythms, tones and melodies of noise.\nSince 2004, Cinder has split her time between Japan and the UK, working on various projects. This has included Cindytalk performing live (solo or group), and a number of (mostly solo) recordings.\nMost notably, Vienna-based label Editions Mego have released a series of Cindytalk albums, mostly comprising solo work by Cinder: The Crackle of My Soul (2009), Up Here in the Clouds (2010), Hold Everything Dear (2011), and A Life Is Everywhere (repast) (2013). A vinyl double album The Poetry of Decay collects both The Crackle of My Soul and Up Here in the Clouds (2010). A 10-inch vinyl split release in tandem with Robert Hampson was released in 2010, featuring Cindytalk's \"Five Mountains of Fire\" and Robert Hampson's \"Antarctica Ends Here\".\nIn the summer of 2005, Cindytalk was invited to use tracks from The Crackle of My Soul as musical score for the UK independent film Madrigal (Rabblewise Films).\nIn summer 2006, based in London, Cindytalk started working on a new (band) album provisionally entitled In A World Without Hope. In Spring 2011, Jacob Burns of Lata (and former bass player with Scottish band Damn Shames) joined Cindytalk on electronics. Cindytalk were invited by Ray Davies of The Kinks to play at the Meltdown Festival on London's Southbank (June 2011).\nThe Indiana-based label BlueSanct released a Cindytalk 10\" called Silver Shoals of Light as part of their 10-year anniversary limited edition ART SINGLES club. Recorded 2006; released 2008.\nMatt Kinnison died from cancer on Wednesday 7 May 2008.\nHandmade Birds announced a new Cindytalk album for summer 2014 entitled touchedRAWKISSEDsour.\nIn 2014, they played the BBC Tectonics festival, sharing a billing with Thurston Moore.\nOf Ghosts and Buildings (2021) was released on the Japanese label Remodel, and Subterminal (2022) on the UK label False Walls, both continuing Cinder's integration of electronics with field recordings. \nIn 2024, the album >Born Trembling< by Tremble With Joy was released on the False Walls label, a new collaboration between Cinder, Michael Anderson (Drekka), Mark Trecka, and Michael Carlson (remst8).\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\nCamouflage Heart (1984) (UK Indie #22)\nIn This World (1988)\nThe Wind Is Strong...

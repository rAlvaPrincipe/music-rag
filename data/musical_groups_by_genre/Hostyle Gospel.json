Its members include Demetrius Morton (King Soloman), Raynard Glass (Proverb), and Fontaine Pizza (Big Job). Hostyle Gospel is best known for their aggressive Christian rap style. The group is also known for creating their own sound called Christian battle music, which also can be referred to as Christian war music or The Hostyle Gospel sound.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and Early Successes (2003–2015) ===\nHostyle Gospel was formed in 2003 from a central Illinois group known as Elite M.O.C. It originally only had two members: Raynard Glass and Demetrius Morton. However, Fontaine Pizza joined the band in 2005. It also has several other members who work on music production, graphic design, and website management.\nIn 2013, Hostyle Gospel got together with the Champaign School of Music and hosted the Family Rock Jam Session for the Community of Champaign/Urbana. The event was the first Christian hip hop performance for an educational program in a Champaign community. After the success of the Family Rock Jam Session, the group made their on-air and debut radio broadcast on 97.9 Jamz WJWZ with their single Break. Later that year, Hostyle Gospel's album Desperation was featured in the gospel magazine Gospel Synergy in a list of new artists and new music to watch out for.

In that same interview, the group talked about why they chose to make an aggressive song like Skittles and Iced Tea. Big Job explained that the group hated how the young black and brown people were being mistreatment in America and felt that it was their job to try to stop some of the bleeding that the country was experiencing at that moment. In an interview with Elna Govendor on praverb.net, Big Job explained Hostyle Gospel's lack of excitement about award shows. He convey that \"award shows are for people, not God. At award shows, people are expected to judge individuals on their art, which they put their blood, sweat and tears into — all to get praise from others, whose opinions shouldn’t matter anyway.\"\nHostyle Gospel has released four studio albums, four mixtapes and has worked with many of the top names in the Christian industry. The group is also being guided and mentored by Christian rap legend Fred Lynch from the Christian hip hop group P.I.D.\nThe group released a single entitled I Am Not The One on January 3, 2020.

The track was a reference to 1998 Chicago Bull's Championship team and Inspiration by Michael Jordan's quote from the ESPN The Last Dance (miniseries) film “They can’t win unless we quit!”, which was a celebration of the Bulls’ second defeat of the Utah Jazz.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2013, the group's album Desperation received a review of 3/5 from gospel music historian, Bob Marovitch, of the Journal of Gospel Music. Marovitch described the group as \"a no-nonsense battle axe who loves the world and its people enough to help them mightily\".

    "text": "Kirpichi (translated as 'Bricks') is an alternative music group from Russia. They originated in Saint Petersburg in the year 1995 as, \"Bricks are Heavy.\" Their last known setlist was at the venue: Urban in Moscow, Russia in the year 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years and rise to fame ===\nThe group's may have started on 15 May 1995, when its founder Vasya V. (Vasiliy Vasin), with Stas Sytnik and Kirill Solovyev, played a first concert in the Petersburg's House of Pioneers. All the song lyrics were in English. Because of heavy membership turnover, they disbanded in 1996.\nIn May 1996 Vasya's father gave them money to record some tracks and then he made a deal with SHOCK-Records label, and soon they published the album \"Kirpichi tyazhely\" ('Bricks are heavy'), which was compiled from translated versions of previous songs. \nIn 1997 and 1998 the group toured, played in many festivals and provided an opening show for Biohazard. As a result the album \"Smert' na reive\" ('Death at the party') was published in 1999, under the Gala Records label. The recording of the third album was fast in spite of the heavy alcohol and drug-using by the group members. However, tragically, the week before the release, on February 18, 2000, drummer Evgeniy Nazarov died from an overdose.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Boo & Gotti were an American hip-hop duo composed of Sabrian \"Boo\" Sledge and Mwata \"Gotti\" Mitchell. They are best known for their guest feature alongside Jay-Z on R. Kelly's 2001 single \"Fiesta (Remix),\" which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. It also spent five consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Their other notable appearances include Kelly's single \"I Wish (Remix)\" in 2000, Big Tymers's single \"Oh Yeah!\" in 2002, and The Fast and the Furious soundtrack in 2001.\nFollowing the success of \"Fiesta\", the duo signed a record deal with Cash Money Records to release their debut and only studio album Perfect Timing (2003). The album narrowly entered the Billboard 200 and was a commercial failure. Following this, the duo was released from Cash Money, and in 2005, Boo signed with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment as a solo artist, but parted ways with the label shortly after.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\n\n\n== References =="

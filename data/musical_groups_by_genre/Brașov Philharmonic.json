    "text": "Brașov Philharmonic (Romanian: Filarmonica Brașov) in Brașov, Romania, is a musical institution founded in 1878 under the name “Kronstaedter Philharmonische Gessellschaft,” with the aim of supporting classical music in Brașov.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince its early days, it has held a key role in the city's cultural sphere, bringing together individuals from diverse backgrounds, especially within the Transylvanian Saxon community. With their backing, the orchestra gained recognition and began to attract well-known artists, establishing a notable presence in the region's music scene.\nThroughout the interwar period, the Philharmonic encountered significant challenges, especially during the world wars, but managed to continue its activities. Following World War II, in 1945, Professor and conductor Dinu Niculescu restructured the Philharmonic, developing it into a stable symphonic orchestra. During this phase, the Philharmonic expanded its repertoire and engaged more with the public by offering symphonic and educational concerts designed for audiences of all ages.\nThe 1960s and 1970s were notable years for Filarmonica Brașov, guided by conductors I. Ionescu-Galați and Mircea Lucescu. Regarded as one of the most skilled provincial orchestras, the Brașov ensemble gained attention across Romania for its quality performances and varied repertoire, hosting unique concert events with established musicians.\nLocated in the renovated Patria Hall (Romanian: Sala Patria), Filarmonica Brașov remains an active part of the city's cultural life, with a program that includes symphonic concerts, recitals, and educational projects. It continues to reach a broad audience, contributing to the appreciation and preservation of both Romanian and international music traditions.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://filarmonicabrasov.ro/index"

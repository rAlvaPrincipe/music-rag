    "text": "The Other Two is an English dance band consisting of Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert of New Order. The band name refers to the fact that the other New Order members, Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook, had already embarked on side projects by the time the first The Other Two record was released. Their debut single \"Tasty Fish\" was released in 1991 and peaked at 41 in the UK Singles Chart.\nThe Other Two have released two albums, The Other Two & You (1993) and Super Highways (1999).\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== The Other Two and You ===\nInitially conceived from the remnants of unused soundtrack work and various studio experiments, The Other Two began during a hiatus in New Order activity. They decided to feature a female vocalist, and in early stages Kim Wilde was recruited as a potential singer for the group. Ultimately however, Gilbert would take over on vocals, and performs on both Other Two albums.\nLead single \"Tasty Fish\" was released in 1991 to positive reviews. However, due to the collapse of Factory Records, The Other Two & You could not be released as initially planned. The release of New Order's Republic in the meantime meant that The Other Two & You was delayed until November 1993, finally being released on London Records. \"Selfish\" was chosen as a second single, and \"Innocence\" was also released as a club 12-inch in the US.\n\n\n=== Super Highways ===\nA follow-up album, Super Highways was released by London in March 1999. The album featured guest vocalist and co-writer Melanie Williams from dance act Sub Sub on selected tracks (\"You Can Fly\", \"One Last Kiss\", \"Super Highways\").\n\n\n== Soundtracks ==\nThe Other Two have been involved in motion picture scoring; particularly TV soundtracks. Most notably they created a theme song for the TV series Common As Muck (the track \"New Horizons\" has elements of this theme tune), as well as the theme for America's Most Wanted. Other soundtrack work includes the series Cold Feet, Making Out and series two of Cracker.  The Other Two also created music for the UK TV programme Reportage, although this was credited as New Order and would be adapted into their 1990 World Cup song \"World in Motion.\"\n\n\n== Other work ==\nMorris and Gilbert reportedly considered assembling a third album around 2010 from other production work, although this did not materialise. The name was also used for Morris and Gilbert's 2014 remix of a Tim Burgess track. \nIn 2022, the duo did a remix of a LoneLady track, (There Is) No Logic.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Other Two on SoundCloud\nOther Two biography at LTM\n\n\n=== Videos ===\nVideo for \"Selfish\".\nVideo for \"Tasty Fish\".\nVideo for \"Super Highways\".\nVideo for \"You Can Fly\"."

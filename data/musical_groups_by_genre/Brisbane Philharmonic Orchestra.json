    "text": "The Brisbane Philharmonic Orchestra (BPO) is a community orchestra based in Brisbane, Australia, which performs a wide variety of orchestral works.\nThe BPO performs several concerts each year at venues including the Brisbane City Hall, and the Old Museum Building, Brisbane. The orchestra also tours regionally throughout Queensland on occasion.\nEntry to the BPO is by audition and it is the only community orchestra within the city that rotates guest conductors by invitation rather than establishing a permanent music director. The organisation is administered by an executive committee elected by the members each year. The members are involved voluntarily in all facets of the organisation such as concert production, marketing and promotion, auditions, and social events.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe orchestra was formed in 1999 with only 18 musicians. In 2000, the orchestra changed its name to the Brisbane Philharmonic Orchestra. The BPO started presenting annual subscription seasons from 2001. In 2005, the orchestra received an honourable recognition at the National Orchestral Awards, the first Queensland community orchestra to have received such a mention. The orchestra presented its 20th annual subscription season in 2020.\nIn addition to performing in its own right, the orchestra has also appeared in many popular music festivals. In May 2021, the ensemble performed with the Synthony touring show at the Brisbane Riverstage. The orchestra has regularly participated in the Queensland Music Festival, and is a long-standing contributor to the 4MBS Festival of Classics. In April 2022, the Ensemble premiered Queensland's first performance of  Shostakovich's Symphony number 4.\n\n\n== Past featured artists ==\n\n\n=== Conductors ===\nSusan Collins\nWerner Andreas Albert\nJohn Curro AM MBE\nPhilip Davis\nSean O'Boyle\nPaul Dean\nNicholas Cleobury\nEmily Cox\nChen Yang\nSimon Hewett\nPeter Luff\nStefanie Smith\nLeo McFadden\nNathan Aspinall\nSergei Korschmin\nDavid Law\nMichael Keen\nSteven Moore\nMichael Keen\nRussell Gray\n\n\n=== Musicians ===\nBrisbane Chorale\nCanticum Chamber Choir\nWilliam Barton (didgeridoo)\nJames Cuddeford (violin)\nDeborah Humble (mezzo-soprano)\nRosario La Spina (tenor)\nSara Macliver (soprano)\nKatie Noonan (singer-songwriter)\nMarkus Stocker (cello)\nMelinda Stocker (violin)\nRussell Powell (cello)\nKarin Schaupp (guitar)\nMalcolm Stewart (horn)\nAlex Raineri (piano)\nJohn Coulton (trumpet)\nJeremy Stafford (guitar)\nOscar Wong (piano)\nRebecca Cassidy (soprano)\nVivienne Collier-Vickers (horn)\nLauren Manuel (horn)\nOliver Boyd (baritone)\nAnna Stephens (soprano)\nAnnika Hinrichs (soprano)\nJonathan Henderson (flute)\nShaun Brown (baritone)\nLevi Hansen (piano)\nTijana Kozarčić (harp)\nRosa Guitar Trio (guitars)\nDavid Wakeham (baritone)\nHenry Choo (baritone)\nNatalie Christer Peluso (soprano)\nBrijette Tubb (flute)\n\n\n=== Other artists ===\nTama Matheson (actor)\nBarry Otto (actor)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCulture of Brisbane\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBrisbane Philharmonic Orchestra (BPO) Website"

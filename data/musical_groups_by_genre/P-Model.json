    "text": "P-Model (also typeset as P-MODEL and P. Model) was a Japanese electronic rock band started in 1979 by members of the defunct progressive rock band Mandrake. The band has experienced many lineup revisions over the years but frontman Susumu Hirasawa was always at the helm of operations. P-Model officially disbanded in 2000, although many of its members continue to release solo albums and collaborate with each other on different projects.\nHirasawa has since released work under the name \"Kaku P-Model\" (核P-Model, lit. 'nucleus of P-Model'), effectively a solo revival of the band.\n\n\n== Members ==\nSusumu Hirasawa (平沢　進) – guitar, vocals, synthesizer, Miburi, Heavenizer, Graviton, Amiga, programming (1 January 1979 – 20 December 2000; 2004–2005, 2013–2014, 2018 as KAKU P-MODEL)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live and Remix-Remake albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nP-Plant CD Vol. 1, 2000\nAshu-on [Sound Subspecies] in the solar system (太陽系亞種音, Taiyōkei Ashu-on), 2002\nGolden☆Best, 2004\nP-Model Warner Years Singles Box, 2012\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Art Mania\", 1979\n\"Kameari Pop\", 1979\n\"Missile\", 1980\n\"junglebed II\", 1981\n\"Index P-0\", 1983\n\"Soldi Air Dance Version\", 1983\n\"Ikari\", 1984\n\"Re;\", 1985\n\"P-Model Another Act 6\", 1985\n\"Another Day\", 1986\n\"Opening SE 1992\", 1992\n\"demo\", 1994\n\"SAKSIT North Passage MIX, 1996\n\">>>Unfix One>>> *Rocket Shoot*\", 1996\n\">>>Unfix Eight>>> *Ashura Clock*\", 1997\n\">>>Unfix Nine>>> *Layer-Green*\", 1997\n\n\n=== Other releases ===\nModel House Works, 1985\n\"Leak\"/\"Birds\", 1986\n\"Pre Drums\", 1986\nZebra Cassette (Zebraカセット, Zebra Kasetto), 1986\nChristmas Song, 1986\n\"SSS-Star Eyes\", 1987\n\"entro Pack\", 1987\n\"Legend of Sadatoshi Tainaka\", 1987\nCassette's Bravo!, 1988\nShut Up'N'Hit Your Stage', 1988\nMusic Industrial Wastes〜P-Model or Die Samples, 1999\nVirtual Live Samples, 1999\nDekikake, 1999\n\"Moon Plant-I (full)\", 1999\n\"Astro-Ho (narration Version)\", 1999\n\"Falling Rain (P-Model version)\", 1999\n\"Illegal Dumping\" (不法投棄, Fuhōtōki), 1999\nGlobal Tribute Battle, 2000\n\"Phase-7\", 2000\n\n\n=== Videography ===\nMoire Vision, 1988\nSankai no Jintai Chizu (三界の人体地図), 1988\nBitmap 1979–1992, 1992\nEnding Error, 1996\nNon-Locality Live Video (非局所性LIVEビデオ), 1997\nLive Video \"Music Industrial Wastes〜P-Model or Die\", 2000\n\n\n=== Music Videos ===\nAll videos from the Great Brain to Harm Harmonizer were directed by Yuichi \"You1\" Hirasawa (Susumu's brother). \"Fu-Ru-He-He-He\", \"2D or Not 2D\" and \"Grid\" were included in \"Bitmap 1979–1992\"; \"Monotone Grid\" was included in \"Phton-3\"; \"http\" was included in \"Rocket Shoot\"; \"Logic Airforce\" was included in \"Live Video Music Industrial Wastes〜P-Model or Die\".\n\n\"The Great Brain\", 1979\n\"I Am Your Only Model\", 1980\n\"different≠another\", 1981\n\"potpourri\", 1981\n\"natural\", 1981\n\"disgusting telephone\", 1981\n\"Heaven\", 1982\n\"Perspective\", 1982\n\"Be in a Fix\", 1982\n\"Hoka No Keikaku\", 1983\n\"Echoes\", 1983\n\"Fu-Ru-He-He-He\", 1983\n\"Atom-Siberia\", 1984\n\"Harm Harmonize\"r, 1984\n\"Karkador\", 1986\n\"Another Day\", 1986\n\"2D or Not 2D\", 1992\n\"Grid\", 1992\nMonotone Grid\", 1994\nPower to Dream\", 1995\n\"http\", 1996\n\"Ashura Clock (Discommunicator)\", 1997\n\"Logic Airforce\", 1999\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nP-Model, as well Susumu Hirasawa through his solo career, have been influential both on musicians, as well as on artists that work on other mediums, with a reputation for having many fans in the manga and anime industries. Their creative collaborators (and even 6 of the band's members) often started out as big fans of and directly influenced by their work: Berserk mangaka Kentaro Miura has found that listening to Hirasawa's songs has helped him regain focus on the themes of his writing multiple times, mangaka/anime director Satoshi Kon wrote that Hirasawa's work was \"a source of imagination and creativity for me\" over the last 20 years of his life, film director Daihachi Yoshida considers Hirasawa as the creator of \"about half of my way of thinking\".\nBeyond associates, P-Model and/or Hirasawa have been cited as influences by musicians such as Fukusuke of Metronome, Hiroyuki Hayashi of Polysics, Daoko (whose song \"Welcome to the Parade\", from 2012's HyperGirl: Mukōgawa no Onna no Ko, was directly influenced by Hirasawa's worldview), Toby Driver of Kayo Dot (who claims the album Plastic House on Base of Sky was an attempt to \"make [his] version of [Hirasawa's] music\") and Kenshi Yonezu (who has said that a Hirasawa song \"changed [his] life\").\nOther artists that have expressed adoration for their work include Klaha of Malice Mizer, Shiroi Heya no Futari mangaka Ryoko Yamagishi, Arika Takarano of Ali Project, Roujin Z/JoJo's Bizarre Adventure director Hiroyuki Kitakubo, voice actress/singer Sumire Uesaka, musician/actor Gen Hoshino, Hellsing mangaka Kouta Hirano, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba mangaka Koyoharu Gotouge, Fullmetal Alchemist/Concrete Revolutio director Seiji Mizushima, Fate/stay night [Réalta Nua]/Taiko no Tatsujin composer Satoshi \"hil\" Ishikawa and actress/singer Ko Shibasaki.\nThe five main characters of the K-On! franchise (Yui Hirasawa, Mio Akiyama, Ritsu Tainaka, Tsumugi Kotobuki and Azusa Nakano) are in a band, share the surnames of late '80s P-Model members and play their respective primary instrument (save for Nakano). All referenced members who are still active have acknowledged the connection. Besides that, P-Model references can also be found on the manga The Sorrow of a Perfectly Healthy Girl and Opus; as well the anime Sailor Moon, Perfect Blue, BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad and Space Dandy. In the world of theatre, musician/playwright Keralino Sandorovich named 2 of his stage plays (Frozen Beach and Blue Cross) after P-Model songs and 1 (Haldyn Hotel) after a Hirasawa solo song.\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\n\n== External links ==\nP-MODEL's Site (English and Japanese)\nP-MODEL Fansite\nP-Model discography at MusicBrainz"

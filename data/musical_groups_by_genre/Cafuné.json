    "text": "Cafuné (stylized in all caps) is an American indie pop duo formed in 2014 by singer-songwriter Sedona Schat and producer Noah Yoo. The two met at New York University. Their single, \"Tek It\", from their debut album, Running (2021) went viral, and they were subsequently signed to Elektra Records in 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\nNoah Yoo was raised in Fairfax, Virginia, where he grew up playing violin and eventually playing guitar in high school bands. He and Sedona Schat both began attending the Clive Davis Institute at New York University in 2012, where the two met and bonded over their appreciation of Two Door Cinema Club.\nSedona Schat grew up in Gardnerville, Nevada where she graduated from Douglas High School. Her family owns a bakery chain on the west coast, Schat's Bakeries. She found a love for music in her youth and was known for her local performances before moving to New York for college. \nIn their sophomore year, Yoo worked on one of Schat's songs, and Cafuné was started as a side project for both of them the following year when Yoo briefly lived with Schat. Yoo also worked as a staffer for Pitchfork. Both Yoo and Schat attended a Masterclass session with Pharrell Williams among other selected CDI students held in the New York University Tisch School of the Arts in 2016.\nCafuné released their debut single, \"Letting Go\", in 2014. They released their debut EP, Love Songs for Other People, in 2015. Running, their debut album, was written and produced by the duo at their homes over several years, recorded throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and released on July 20, 2021 through their own label, Aurelians Club. The song reconsider was mixed by Kyle Pulley at Headroom Studios.  The album featured the singles \"High\", \"Want Me Out\", and \"Tek It\", the last of which went viral on TikTok in early 2022 due to its use in anime edits and other trends on the platform, which prompted Elektra Records to sign the duo in June 2022. They opened for Chvrches on their summer 2022 tour.\n\"Tek It\" was sampled by Lil Uzi Vert for their track \"Red Moon\", released on December 25th, 2023. That year, the duo released two new extended plays: Love Songs for the End in October, and its follow-up, Versions for the End, in December.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nCafuné's music has been described as alt-pop, indie pop, dream pop, and indie rock. Their earlier music was electropop and synth-pop, and their music became more rock-oriented after they played at various college shows.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

The choir has performed at renowned American venues such as Carnegie Hall, the National Cathedral, and the White House. Kyiv Chamber Choir sings much of its music a cappella. Its repertoire includes well-known classical compositions, but also that of Ukrainian composers such as Mykola Lysenko, Mykola Leontovych, Kyrylo Stetsenko, Artem Vedel, and Mykola Diletsky.\nThe Kyiv Chamber Choir has done well in international choral competitions.

    "text": "The USSR State Jazz Band (or the State Jazz Orchestra of the USSR, Russian: Государственный джаз-оркестр СССР) was a Soviet jazz band that existed in 1930s–1940s.\nAfter it was auditioned by Joseph Stalin in 1938, a number of similar state-sponsored musical ensembles were created across the country.\n\n\n== Critical analysis ==\nS. Frederick Starr comments in his book on the Soviet jazz that the band \"played with a polish and precision any Western pop orchestra might have envied\". But then he adds:\n\nFor all its precision, the State Jazz Orchestra was a dismal failure. Tsfasman's Americanism and his unpopularity with the bureaucrats had disqualified him for the position of conductor, which went instead to Victor Knushevitsky, a capable musician with absolutely no feeling for jazz. Miffed, Tsfasman then declined the post of second pianist that was offered him, leaving no true jazz player except [drummer Ivan] Bacheev in a position of importance in the State Jazz Orchestra. Knushevitsky's classical background and ignorance of jazz predisposed him to turn the band into a kind of chamber orchestra with saxophones. The results were disastrous. What began as a small group rapidly snowballed into a forty-three piece ensemble, quite enough to stifle any jazz feeling or spontaneity that individual musicians might have spirited into the group.\nBoris Schwarz's book Music and Musical Life in Soviet Russia, 1917–1970 describes The State Jazz Orchestra of the USSR as \"essentially\" a \"„light“ music\" (easy listening) orchestra.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\n\"Katyusha\" (1939)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Katyusha\" (1939) – The State Jazz Orchestra of the USSR conducted by Victor Knushevitsky, soloists: Valentina Batishcheva, Pavel Mikhailov and Vsevolod Tyutyunnik on YouTube"

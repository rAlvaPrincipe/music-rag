    "text": "The Alan Bown Set, later known as The Alan Bown! or just Alan Bown, were a British band of the 1960s and 1970s whose music evolved from jazz and blues through soul and rhythm and blues and ended up as psychedelia and progressive rock. The band achieved limited chart success and is best known for the role it played in developing the careers of numerous musicians including Mel Collins, John Helliwell, Robert Palmer, Jess Roden and Dougie Thomson.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nAlan Bown (born Alan James Bown, 21 July 1942, Slough, Berkshire died 16 December 2014, Slough), a trumpet player, joined The Embers in 1963, when he left the RAF. This group played both jazz and American rhythm and blues, and were a successful live act, playing at venues like The Star-Club, Hamburg at the same time as The Beatles.  Bown left the group to join The John Barry Seven, who were backing Brenda Lee, and toured and recorded with the band until it broke up in 1965; Barry made Bown the leader of the touring band, so he could spend more time composing.\n\n\n== Reformation ==\nBown formed The Alan Bown Set around May 1965, initially with three former members of The John Barry Seven—Jeff Bannister (lead vocals and organ) (born Jeffrey Bannister, 7 January 1943), Dave Green (sax, clarinet and flute) and Stan Haldane (bass)—together with Pete Burgess (guitar) and Vic Sweeney (drums).  They played American R&B and soul and played the same club circuit as Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames and Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers.  In 1965 Tony Hatch signed to them to Pye Records but their first single, \"Can't Let Her Go\" / \"I'm The One\", did not chart.  In 1966 Green was replaced by John Helliwell and shortly after Jess Roden joined as a vocalist, allowing Bannister to concentrate on keyboards. They appeared on Ready Steady Go! and at The Windsor Jazz Festival and began headlining London's Marquee Club.\nThis line-up released three singles, none of which charted, although \"Emergency 999\" later became a Northern Soul club anthem. The Alan Bown Set and Jimmy James and the Vagabonds were both recorded live and released on a joint album, London Swings: Live at the Marquee Club, with one side each.\nIn November 1966 Burgess was replaced by Tony Catchpole and in 1967 the band released \"Gonna Fix You Good (Everytime You're Bad)\" / \"I Really, Really Care\" and recorded the soundtrack for Jeu de Massacre, a French film featuring Jacques Loussier. They recorded for the BBC's Rhythm and Blues programme in 1966 and Saturday Club in 1967.\n\n\n== The Alan Bown! ==\nWhen the band's Pye Records contract expired in 1967, Bown reformed the band as \"The Alan Bown!\" a psychedelic band on Verve Records, They finally released their first full album Outward Bown in 1968 and appeared on Top Gear. The album included a cover of Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\", a stage version which \"directly inspired Hendrix's arrangement of the song\". In 1968 they performed \"We Can Help You\" on Top of the Pops; this was at No 26 in the UK chart but the pressing plant went on strike, so they could not capitalise on the exposure. \nIn 1969 they changed to Deram Records, where they had a minor hit with \"Still as Stone\". As with many bands at the time, they recorded cover versions for the BBC, appearing on the '’Jimmy Young Show'’, \"The David Symonds Show\" and others, as restricted needle time required \"live\" performances between the records. Their next album, The Alan Bown!, had been recorded when Roden left the band. Robert Palmer joined and re-recorded the vocals before the album's UK release, although the Roden vocals were issued in the US (and has never been reissued).  The band appeared on BBC TV's Disco Two (which became The Old Grey Whistle Test).\nIn 1970 the band changed labels again, to Island Records. They recorded the album Listen, but Palmer promptly left, being replaced by Gordon Neville, who re-recorded the vocals before the album was eventually released. The single \"Pyramid\" was released before Andy Brown replaced Haldane and Mel Collins joined on saxophone. They recorded another album, Stretching Out, and re-appeared on Disco Two.  Bannister left but was not replaced, then Dougie Thomson replaced Brown and Derek Griffiths, formerly with The Artwoods, replaced Catchpole.  This line-up continued until February 1972.  Bown then formed a new band with Dave Lawson (keyboards), Tony Dangerfield (bass) and Frank White (guitar) replaced by Pete Goodall, formerly with Thunderclap Newman, Nick Payn (tenor saxophone and flute) and Alan Coulter (drums), but after a major tour, Bown finally disbanded the group in July 1972.\n\n\n== Subsequent careers ==\nAlan Bown joined Jonesy, and then became an A&R manager with CBS Records.\nJeff Bannister joined A Band Called O in the 1970s, and has been in The Swinging Blue Jeans since 2010.\nMel Collins worked with King Crimson, Alexis Korner and numerous other bands.\nJohn Helliwell and Dougie Thomson joined Supertramp.\nGordon Neville later joined Elton John's band, and worked with Rick Wakeman.\nRobert Palmer joined Dada, which evolved into Vinegar Joe, and then had a successful solo career and formed Power Station.\nJess Roden formed his own band Bronco.\nVic Sweeney worked with Kevin Coyne.\nPete Goodall worked with Percy Sledge, Viola Wills, Carl Douglas and many more.\nNick Payn currently plays in Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings.\nDave Lawson joined/co-founded Greenslade, with whom he played until their break-up in late 1975.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nMelody Maker spoke of their Outward Bown album in 1968 as: \"A fine band who have had difficulty in crystallising their approach but always record quality pop. Tracks include \"Toyland\". Jess Roden's vocals are excellent as always.\", and said of the band in 1970: \"A band who seem to have missed the boat in acceptance but always produce worthwhile albums. Robert Palmer is a good replacement for Jess Roden as lead vocalist, and they obtain a hot brass sound.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nAlan Bown – trumpet (1965 – 1972)\nJeff Bannister – organ (1965 – 1971)\nDave Green – sax (1965 – January 1966)\nStan Haldane – bass (1965 – 1970)\nPete Burgess – guitar (1965 – November 1966)\nVic Sweeney – drums (1965 – February 1972)\nJohn Helliwell – trumpet (January 1966 – February 1972)\nJess Roden – lead vocals (1966 – 1969)\nTony Catchpole – guitar (November 1966 – 1971)\nRobert Palmer – lead vocals (1969 – 1970)\nGordon Neville – lead vocals (1970 – February 1972)\nAndy Brown – bass (1970 – 1971)\nMel Collins – saxophone (1970 – February 1972)\nDougie Thompson – bass (1971 – February 1972)\nDerek Griffiths – guitar (1971 – February 1972)\nDave Lawson – keys (February – July 1972)\nTony Dangerfield – bass (February – July 1972)\nFrank White – guitar (February – ? 1972)\nPete Goodall – guitar (? – July 1972)\nNick Payn – sax (February – July 1972)\nAlan Coulter – drums (February – July 1972)\n\n\n=== Line–ups ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSingles\n\"Can't Let Her Go\" / \"I'm the One\" (1966) Pye\n\"Baby Don't Push Me\" / \"Everything's Gonna Be Alright\" (1966) Pye\n\"Headline News\" / \"Mister Pleasure\" (1966) Pye – UK #52\n\"Emergency 999\" / \"Settle Down\" (1966) Pye\n\"Gonna Fix You Good (Everytime You're Bad)\" / \"I Really, Really Care\" (1967) Pye\n\"Jeu De Massacre\" (1967) Disques Vogue\n\"We Can Help You\" / \"Magic Handkerchief\" (1967) Music Factory – UK #55\n\"Toyland\" / \"Technicolour Dream\" (1967) MGM – UK #53\n\"Story Book\" / \"Little Lesley\" (1968) MGM\n\"Still As Stone\" / \"Wrong Idea\" (1969) Deram\n\"Gypsy Girl\" / \"All I Can\" (1969) Deram\n\"Pyramid\" / \"Crash Landing\" (1971) Island\n\"Rockford Files\" /\"I Don't Know\" (1975) CBS\nAlbums\nLondon Swings: Live at the Marquee Club (1966) Pye (1 side) (1994) Castle (CD)\nOutward Bown (November 1968) Music Factory\nThe Alan Bown (February 1970) Deram (US featured Jess Roden's vocals; UK and subsequent reissues featured Robert Palmer's vocals)\nListen (November 1970) Island\nStretching Out (August 1971) Island\nCompilations\nKick Me Out (1985) See for Miles\nEmergency 999 (2002) Sequel\nThis discography was compiled from several sources, but there are a number of inconsistencies.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nThe Alan Bown Set – Before and Beyond by Jeff Bannister, published by Banland Publishing Ltd\n\n\n== External links ==\nJess Roden on The Alan Bown"

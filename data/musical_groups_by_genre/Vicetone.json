    "text": "Vicetone is a Dutch electronic music production DJ duo formed by Ruben den Boer (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈrybə(n) dəm ˈbuːr]; born 22 January 1992) and Victor Pool (pronounced [ˈvɪktɔr poːl]; born 9 July 1992) from Groningen. The duo began as a DJ act, and in 2013, they were voted into the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs list for the first time at 60th as a new entry. Later in 2014, they went up 24 places on the list, coming 36th. In 2015, they fell 14 places to 50th. They made a return to the Top 100, coming in at 83rd in 2019 but dropped out the subsequent year.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2015, Vicetone released two singles with Kat Nestel titled \"Angels\" and \"Nothing Stopping Me,\" both on Ultra Music, released a remix for a song from the popular game League of Legends called \"Project Yi\" and they remixed Hardwell and Tiesto's collaboration, \"Colors\".\nTo start off 2016, Vicetone released a new track on Spinnin' Records called \"Pitch Black\". This was followed by the release of their first EP entitled Aurora, which was released in April before the beginning of a headline tour of the same name. In June 2016, they released the song 'Nevada' to Monstercat in collaboration with Cozi Zuehlsdorff.\nIn 2018, Vicetone released another single with Cozi Zuehlsdorff titled \"Way Back\".\nIn 2020, Vicetone rose to international stardom over the rise of their 2014 remix of Tony Igy's song \"Astronomia\" as an internet meme, in which the remix plays over a group of Ghanaian men dancing while carrying a coffin, a common funeral tradition in Ghana and parts of Africa with the idea of sending off deceased loved ones in style, rather than in the usual manner of mourning.\nOn 22 January 2021, Vicetone announced that their debut album titled \"Legacy\" would be releasing on 2 April of that same year. This announcement came alongside the release of its lead single, \"No Rest\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Production credits ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n\n\n==== Charted ====\nTony Igy - Astronomia (Vicetone Remix) (2014)\n\n\n==== 2012 ====\nCalvin Harris featuring Ne-Yo – Let's Go (Vicetone Remix)\nFlo Rida – Whistle (Vicetone Remix)\nAdele – Someone Like You (Vicetone Remix)\nMaroon 5 – Payphone (Vicetone Remix)\nNicky Romero and Fedde le Grand featuring Matthew Koma – Sparks (Vicetone Remix)\nMorgan Page – The Longest Road (Vicetone Remix)\nYoungblood Hawke – We Come Running (Vicetone Remix)\nZedd – Clarity (Vicetone Remix)\n\n\n==== 2013 ====\nHook N Sling vs Nervo – Reason (Vicetone Remix)\nDoctor P. featuring Eva Simons – Bulletproof (Vicetone Remix)\nCazzette – Weapon (Vicetone Remix)\nDavid Puentez featuring Shena – The One (Vicetone remix)\nMatthew Koma – One Night (Vicetone Remix)\nNervo – Hold On (Vicetone Remix)\nNicky Romero vs. Krewella – Legacy (Vicetone Remix)\nLinkin Park and Steve Aoki - A Light That Never Comes (Vicetone Remix)\n\n\n==== 2014 ====\nKrewella - Enjoy The Ride (Vicetone Remix)\nCash Cash - Overtime (Vicetone Remix)\nDillon Francis, The Chain Gang of 1974, Sultan & Shepard - When We Were Young (Vicetone Remix)\n\n\n==== 2015 ====\nUrban Cone featuring Tove Lo - Come Back To Me (Vicetone Remix)\nLittle Boots - No Pressure (Vicetone Remix)\nHardwell and Tiësto featuring Andreas Moe - Colors (Vicetone Remix)\nKelly Clarkson - Invincible (Vicetone Remix)\n\n\n==== 2016 ====\nProject: Yi (Vicetone Remix) (from League of Legends)\nVicetone x Bob Marley - Is This Love [Free]\nBonnie McKee and Vicetone - I Want It All (Remix)\nThe Weeknd featuring Daft Punk - Starboy (Vicetone Remix)\n\n\n==== 2017 ====\nA R I Z O N A - Oceans Away (Vicetone Remix)\nDua Lipa - New Rules (Vicetone Remix)\n\n\n==== 2018 ====\nThe Prodigy - Omen (Vicetone Remix)\nThe Knocks  featuring Foster The People - Ride Or Die (Vicetone Remix)\n\n\n==== 2020 ====\nAlesso featuring Liam Payne - \"Midnight\" (Vicetone Remix)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

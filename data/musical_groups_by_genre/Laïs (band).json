    "text": "Laïs is a Flemish group that creates folk, and world music consisting of polyphonic close harmony songs, occasionally a cappella, based on self-composed melodies with lyrics dating back to the Middle Ages. \"Laïs\" is a Celtic word, meaning \"voice\".\n\n\n== History ==\nLaïs' career started in 1994, when Jorunn Bauweraerts and Annelies Brosens, together with Soetkin Collier (who later became a vocalist with the Belgian folk music group  Urban Trad)  performed a song at a folk festival in Gooik, near Brussels. Somewhat later, Collier left the group and Nathalie Delcroix joined. They had their breakthrough after their appearance at Folk Dranouter, near Ypres, in 1996.\nTheir debut CD album, sung a cappella as well as accompanied instrumentally by the folk rock band Kadril, was released in 1998. They performed at the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees in Oudtshoorn, South Africa (1996), at Vorst Nationaal, Belgium (1998), Canada, France (1999) (as a supporting act for Sting), Spain (1999, 2000), the Netherlands and China (2001).\n\nDuring the summer of 2000 they performed at important festivals in Belgium and the Netherlands, such as Pinkpop and Rock Werchter. In 2001 they made a much acclaimed return to the festival at Dranouter.\nIn 2003 they made a mini tour along Flemish churches and chapels, singing a cappella with the vocal support of Ludo Vandeau. This resulted in the CD \"A la capella\".\nIn April 2004 they released their third CD to the market under the title Douce Victime, with covers from Jacques Brel and Herman van Veen. This time it not only contained a cappella songs but also Cajun music, the London Chamber Orchestra and some World Music influences. It was recorded at the legendary Abbey Road Studios in London.\nWith their album The Ladies' Second Song, released in September 2007, the group changed their approach and tried to reach a broader public. They could no longer be characterized as folk. The album introduces the use of electric guitars, loops and electronic beats. Their lyrics have equally undergone a thorough overhaul. Instead of drawing their lyrics from old Flemish songbooks, they have turned to poetry from William Butler Yeats, Paul Verlaine and Pablo Neruda.\nIn 2009 they released the album Laïs Lenski together with the cellist Simon Lenski. In September 2020, after 25 years of singing together, the group announced the departure of Annelies Brosens. Since then, Nathalie Delcroix and Jorunn Bauweraerts continue to perform as Laïs, together with their musicians.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe female vocal trio part of Laïs are three young women from Kalmthout:\n\nThey are accompanied by four men:\n\nFritz Sundermann (electric and acoustic instruments, harmonium);\nHans Quaghebeur (squeezeboxes, hurdy-gurdy, whistle);\nRonny Reuman (percussion);\nBart Denolf (electric and acoustic bass).\nLaïs has also renewed their band: \n\nElko Blijweert (guitar);\nBjorn Eriksson (guitar, elektronica);\nJeroen Stevens (drums);\nFilip Vandebril (contrabas);\nDan Lacksman (synthesizer, former Telex (band), Dan Lacksman's Alliance, producer) did the mixing at the sound console.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nLaïs, ALEA, 1998\nDorothea, Virgin Music Belgium, 2000\nDorothea ltd. ed., Virgin Music Belgium, 2001\nA la capella, Virgin Music Belgium, 2003\nDouce victime, Virgin Music Belgium, 2004\nDocumenta (Compilation), EMI, 2006\nThe Ladies' Second Song, 2007\nLaïs Lenski, 2009 (together with the cellist Simon Lenski)\nMidwinter tales, Own publication, 2013\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n't Smidje, ALEA, 1998\nDe Ballade van Boon, EMI Belgium, 1999\nDorothea, Virgin Music Belgium (2000)\nLe grand vent, Virgin Music Belgium, 2001\nLe renard et la belette, Virgin Music Belgium, 2002\nRinaldo (2004)\nDe Klacht van een Verstoten Minnares (2004)\nKalima Kadara (2005)\nQui a Tué Grand'maman (2006)\nJoskesong (2007)\nThe Lady's Second Song (2007)\nIn de Bleke Winterzon (2008)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n(missing link) (in Dutch) Interview with Dirk Steenhaut, newspaper De Morgen, 22 September 2007\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

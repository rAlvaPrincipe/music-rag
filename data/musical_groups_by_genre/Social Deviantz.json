They are noted for their unique downtempo style of hip hop music, and for being one of the pioneers of the Vancouver rap scene. They are specifically praised for their musical and cultural contributions.\n\n\n== History ==\nSocial Deviantz were formed in early 1992 as part of the Sugarshack roster of artists. Their most notable release continues to be their debut full-length album, Essential Mental Nutrients, first distributed in 1996.\nAs well as two full-length albums, Social Deviantz have released a handful of EPs (including the 2001 vinyl release, Space + Time, issued only in the United States). Two of their singles, \"Minimal\" and \"Lucky 5\", received global airplay, including locally on Vancouver's The Beat 94.5 radio station.\nSocial Deviantz have also appeared on Muchmusic and YTV for interviews.\nIn 2006 the band released a long-shelved album Bleaky Deky, and in 2009 Spread (a compilation of previously released tracks) was distributed. A video release for \"Red Tape\", resulted in play on multiple networks including Fuse, MTV, and a spin on Halloween night 2008 on Rage (ABC1 Australia).\nIn 2019, a vinyl reissue of Essential Mental Nutrients was released by Diggers With Gratitude.\n\n\n== Members ==\nA-Train - emcee\nFatbone - emcee\nJunya - DJ/producer\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEpitonic\nMySpace"

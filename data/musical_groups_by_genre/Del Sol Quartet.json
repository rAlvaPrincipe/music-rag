    "text": "The Del Sol Quartet is a string quartet based in San Francisco, California that was founded in 1992 by violist Charlton Lee.\nDel Sol has commissioned and premiered thousands of works from a diverse range of international composers, including Terry Riley, Frederic Rzewski, Tania León, Mason Bates, Gabriela Lena Frank, Huang Ruo, Michael Harrison, Ben Johnston, Chinary Ung, Daniel Bernard Roumain, Kui Dong, Mohammed Fairouz, Theresa Wong, Erberk Eryilmaz, Ken Ueno, Peter Sculthorpe, Pamela Z, Reza Vali, Per Nørgård.\nAs of 2023, quartet members are Benjamin Kreith (violin), Hyeyung Sol Yoon (violin), Charlton Lee (viola), and Kathryn Bates (cello). Hyeyung Sol Yoon, formerly of the Chiara String Quartet, succeeded violinist Samuel Weiser. \n\n\n== Founding ==\nFounded in 1992, the Del Sol String Quartet began its life in residence at the Banff Centre for the Arts, followed by residency at San Francisco State University in association with the Alexander String Quartet. In 2002, Del Sol released its CD Tear. Del Sol was named winner of the Chamber Ensemble/Mixed Repertory category for 2005-2006 by Chamber Music America and ASCAP, and also received an ASCAP award for Adventurous Programming of Contemporary Music Other early appointments included the 2003 \"Emerging Quartets and Composers Residency\" with the Muir String Quartet and Joan Tower in Park City, Utah; Quartet-in-Residence at University of New Mexico; residencies at The Walden School and Tahoe Music Festival; and Northeastern University in 2007. Del Sol appears on programs presented by Other Minds, San Francisco Performances, Montalvo Arts Center and Santa Fe New Music/Santa Fe Opera. (from website)\n\n\n== Interest in Just Intonation ==\nThe quartet demonstrates a particular interest in string quartet writing in just intonation, particularly in the work of American composer Ben Johnston, along with composers such as Michael Harrison, Theresa Wong and Mathew Rosenblum. They are currently the only string quartet touring multiple quartets by Ben Johnston, which are notoriously difficult, and were the first group to premiere Johnston's music at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., in 2016.  In 2019, the quartet launched the \"Pacific Pythagorean Music Festival\", a music festival dedicated to works of just intonation. They were highlighted performers at the Pittsburgh \"Beyond 2020: Microtonal Music Festival\". They premiered \"One-Footed\" by composer Taylor Brook with the Partch Ensemble at REDCAT in 2022.\n\n\n== Amplifying Asian Voices ==\nThe Quartet's repertoire has always been chosen from the vantage point of San Francisco, looking across the Pacific Ocean, with a dedicated interest in the Pacific Rim and Asia. With the launching of the Angel Island Project in 2017, alongside the increase in violence and hate crimes against Asian-Americans, the Quartet deepened its commitment to champion the musical and artistic voices of both Asian and Asian-American composers. This work includes majors projects, commissioning of composers, and community work.\nIn 2021, the Quartet premiered Huang Ruo's ANGEL ISLAND – Oratorio with Volti inside the Angel Island Immigration Station as well as San Francisco's Presidio Theatre. They previewed excerpts at Bard College's China Now music festival. Since the premiere, the Quartet has performed a new version at the Santa Fe Opera and with the UC Berkeley Choir, which launched an entire year of curriculum and events based on Angel Island. Future performances include the Smithsonian National Museum of Asian Art with the US Air Force Band Singing Sergeants.\nIn 2022, the Quartet recorded The Resonance Between with Alam Khan (sarode/composer) and Arjun Verma (sitar/composer). This album is set to release in 2023-2024, with a world premiere performance.\nThe Quartet has an ongoing relationship with the Last Hoisan Poets (Genny Lim, Flo Oy Wong, Nellie Wong), who work to preserve their native dialect through poetry. The first collaborative performance focused on keeping Angel Island In Sight, with recent performances at the De Young Museum.\n\n\n== Podcast ==\nSounds Current a Del Sol Podcast was launched in June of 2024. Co-hosted by Quartet founding member Charlton Lee, the inaugural season follows the creation and journey of Del Sol with Huang Ruo's Angel Island Oratorio. From its premiere at the Presidio Theater of San Francisco in 2021 to its recent sold-out performances in New York in 2024, The Angel Island Project has brought the history and poetry of Angel Island’s detainees to audiences across the US and overseas. \nAlongside Lee, the podcast is co-hosted by Del Sol’s cellist Kathryn Bates and violinists Benjamin Kreith and Hyeyung Sol Yoon. Season one guests include composer Huang Ruo, Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation’s Executive Director Ed Tepporn, poet Genny Lim, Angel Island descendent Andi Wong, and Angel Island State Park interpreter Casey Dexter-Lee. Additional featured guests include Sid Chen, Emiko Ono, Susan Moffat, Senior Master Sergeant Taylor Armstrong, and Matthew Ozawa.  \nSounds Current was also one of four podcasts nominated for the 2024 Tribeca Festival's Independent Audio Nonfiction Award.

They are known for their nature performances, including roaming concerts at the Albany Bulb, pop-up concerts in Mendocino's redwoods, and their annual white water rafting trip on Yampa River the with Holiday Expeditions.\nThey also work in the intersection of artists and climate change activism, including a current project with Gabriela Lena Frank Creative Academy of Music's \"Composing Earth\" program.\n\n\n== Joy Project ==\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, the Quartet commissioned over 20 works known as the Joy Project, which they began performing outdoors in September 2020 to inspire joy in the community. The performances occurred in pop-up locations of street corners, closed movie theatres, coffee shops, and parks. Composers include: Pamela Z, Lisa Mezzaccappa, Andy Akiho, Mark Orton, and more. In 2022-2023, the performances continued through partnerships, including performances at the Salesforce Park and different branches of the San Francisco Public Library.

    "text": "The Goodees (Kay Evans, Sandra Jackson and Judy Williams) were an American pop music girl group who enjoyed brief popularity in the late 1960s.  Formed in Memphis, Tennessee, the group is best known for the minor hit \"Condition Red\", a teen melodrama that bore a striking resemblance to the Shangri-Las hit \"Leader of the Pack\".\nThe three girls became friends while attending Memphis' Messick High School. Interested in music, they started singing at school assemblies and local events.  Their “break” came in 1967 when they won a local talent contest.  The winning prize included an audition with Stax Records.  Stax signed the trio to its newly formed HIP subsidiary.\nGoodee Sandra Jackson more recently worked at SoulsVille USA, an on-line museum that chronicles the history of Memphis rhythm and blues.\nThe band's song, \"Condition Red\", was their only hit, peaking at #46 on the Billboard charts. \"Condition Red\" can be found on girl-group compilations such as Rhino's One Kiss Can Lead to Another and the first volume of the Where the Girls Are CD series.  Their song \"Jilted\" can be found on volume six of the Where the Girls Are series.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nIn December 2010, Ace Records UK issued a CD compilation, Condition Red!  The Complete Goodees. The album contains the entire Candy Coated Goodees LP, four non-LP singles and B-sides, and seven never-before released tracks.\n\nCompilation Track listing\n\nCondition Red\nSad Song For Harry\nA Little Bit Of You\nDouble Shot\nWorst that Could Happen\nGirl Crazy\nJilted\nDidn't Know Love Was So Good\nMy Boyfriend's Back\nPromises\nHe's A Rebel\nFor A Little While (non-LP single)\nWould You, Could You (non-LP b-side)\nLove Is Here (non-LP biside)\nGoodies (non-LP b-side)\nAngry Eyes (previously unreleased)\nLove Me Love (previously unreleased)\nShow Me How (previously unreleased)\nLast Of The Good Guys (previously unreleased)\nDidn't Know Love Was So Good (Alternate Version, previously unreleased)\nHave You Ever Hurt The One You Love (previously unreleased)\nLove Pill (previously unreleased)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Goodees\".

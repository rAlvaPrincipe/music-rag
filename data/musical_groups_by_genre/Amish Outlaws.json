    "text": "The Amish Outlaws are an American cover band from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The band was formed in 2002 and is composed of three ex-Amish and three \"honorary Amish\" musicians.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe Amish Outlaws began in 2002. Three of the founding members, Ezekiel, Amos Def, and Hezekiah X moved to New York City after leaving the Amish community. They originally began playing in a band for fun and eventually decided to become The Amish Outlaws to make a living from it.  Three of the six members are from the Pennsylvania Dutch Amish community in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, specifically from the Old Order Amish. The band wanted to play popular culture rock music that was not typical of their traditional Amish upbringing. The band plays renditions of songs by contemporary composers and talk about their rumspringa experience as ex-members of the Amish community. They primarily tour the East Coast of the United States. (Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia and Virginia.) \nThey have performed in Las Vegas. at Bally’s Casino and at FreedomFest at Paris Resort. The band has also performed two cruises to Bermuda in 2013 and 2014. The band performs at the annual concert series Musikfest. held in Bethlehem, PA.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nThe band members are known for their movement style where they, in the words of writer Simon J. Bronner, \"frenetically jump and gyrate on stage in Amish garb.\" Band member Ezekiel has stated that they use the clothing as a gimmick, but not in a disrespectful manner. Growing up, the band members did not have much exposure to music outside the Amish community. They sang to Ausbund and heard bits and pieces of music from cars passing through their community. The band performs songs across several genres including pop, rock, rhythm and blues, reggae, dance, country, and heavy metal. The band is constantly changing and updating their musical set list.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nBrother Amos Def plays the keyboard, guitar, banjo, and vocals.

    "text": "Daddy DJ is a French dance act consisting of David Le Roy and Jean-Christophe Belval.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\nDavid Le Roy and Jean-Christophe Belval first met at the French sound engineering school in Paris, where Berval was a teacher while Le Roy was a student. They got along very well, so much so that they soon founded their own music project, titled Daddy DJ. They were soon joined by Charly Merkiled, who originates from Martinique.\nTheir debut self-titled single \"Daddy DJ\", released in April 2000, became a hit across Europe. It reached 2nd position in the French top 100 for almost 5 months. In Germany the song reached 7th place, while in Switzerland the song reached 22nd place in the charts, in addition to the singles The Girl In Red (41) and Over You (96). In Austria, it reached 8th position. The song was also very successful in Northern Europe, topping the charts in Sweden and Norway and peaking at #2 in Denmark and at #3 in Finland. Their later singles \"The Girl in Red\" and \"Over You\" proved less popular though, and they remained a one-hit wonder in most countries. In 2012, they recorded a new album called Folder, which also failed to find commercial success.\n\n\n=== Character ===\nMany of Daddy DJ's music videos feature a 13-year-old male known as Kross. He is depicted in the music videos as a child DJ prodigy who is more adept at DJing than his father.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n2001: Let Your Body Talk\n2012: Folder\n2024: Rendez Vous\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDaddy DJ on Myspace"

They consisted of Nikol Šneiderová, Kristýna Pecková, Hana Hladíková, and Kristýna Šlingrová, all aged 9–11 at the time of the group's inception.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in September 2009, when its members left the girl group 5Angels after an internal conflict.\nDiamond Cats' first live performance took place in September 2009, at the \"First School Bell\" event in Plzeň. Their debut single was titled \"One, Two Step\". In 2010, they released the album Showbyznys, whose title song went on to become their best-known hit. The accompanying YouTube video was viewed over 200,000 times in two months. In the following years, Diamond Cats issued two more albums, Deja vu (2011) and Na dlani (2012).\nAfter Hladíková left the group, at the end of 2013, the remaining members decided not to continue without her.\n\n\n== Song themes and management ==\nDiamond Cats' songs were mainly themed around friendship, love, fashion, and regrets over people's misfortunes. Musically, the band was led by Nikol Davídková, who wrote and produced their songs and acted as their singing instructor. Choreographically, the band members were trained at Yemi A.D.'s Dance Academy Prague.\n\n\n== Endorsements ==\nDiamond Cats were several times asked to be the face of Hasbro's Littlest Pet Shop franchise.

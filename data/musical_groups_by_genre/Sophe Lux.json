The band has released four albums: All Are One (2016), Hungry Ghost (2009), Waking the Mystics (2007), and Plastic Apple (2002).\n\n\n== History ==\nSophe Lux was formed in 2002 in Portland, Oregon. It began as a  vehicle for singer-songwriter Gwynneth Haynes, the younger sister of film director Todd Haynes (Velvet Goldmine, I'm Not There, Far From Heaven).

Larry Crane played as a multi instrumentalist on the album, with John Mowen (The Decemberists, Steve Malkmus & the Jicks) on drums, and Mike Clark (Steve Malkmus & The Jicks) on keys. Plastic Apple was mastered by Jeff Saltzman (Death Cab for Cutie).\nThe album was released on Haynes' record label Zarthustra Records in 2002. It explores themes of love and tragedy and features a song dedicated to Nietzsche, one of Haynes' noted muses. With references to Nietzsche, Wagner, and Lord Byron, critics dubbed Haynes the girl singer-songwriter for the brainy set.

Choral arrangements for the rock opera inspired song \"Marie Antoinette Robot\" were written by Camelia Nine.\nWaking the Mystics was released on the Zarathustra Records label in 2007. The cover for the album, \"Mr. Bunny\" is by pop surrealist Marion Peck. The album explores themes hypnosis and consumerism, and has a song dedicated to Nietzsche's muse Lou Salome.\n\nReception\nThe album was well received with Haynes' songs being compared to the likes of Kate Bush, Queen, The Decemberists, and David Bowie.\nThe track \"Electra 33\"  appeared on CW promos for TV show The Vampire Diaries, and the track \"Target Market\" appeared on Starz Network TV show Gravity.

    "text": "Speakeasy Tiger was an American pop band from Denver, Colorado.\nSpeakeasy Tiger was founded in 2008 by Kyle Simmons (vocals), Peter Schmidt (piano, synth, keytar) and Lauren Gale (bass). Shortly thereafter members Lucas Gordon (drums) and Tavis Alley (guitar) were recruited to finish the band's lineup.\nIn early 2010 vocalist Kyle Simmons left Speakeasy Tiger and was replaced by frontwoman Katrina Stone. In the fall of 2010 the group announced it would take an indefinite hiatus after members Katrina Stone and Peter Schmidt left the band.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and debut album (2008–2010) ===\nIn the summer of 2008 original vocalist Kyle Simmons took her solo folk project Girl Named Kyle in a different direction, pairing with Peter Schmidt and Lauren Gale to form a backing band for her improvised compositions. Soon after the Denver-based group changed its name to Speakeasy Tiger after making the decision to change genres of music from folk to pop.\nThe name Speakeasy Tiger was derived as a satirical play on the words speakeasy and blind tiger, which individually are both slang for the reference of illegal establishments selling alcohol during Prohibition. Original vocalist Kyle Simmons is quoted saying:\n\nThe name Speakeasy Tiger is a sort of passive aggressive term. I think of 'Tiger' as aggressive and 'Speakeasy' as more passive. The combination of words suits the members of this band perfectly and the kind of impact we're trying to create.\nThe group began looking for members to finish the line up in November 2008. They found drummer Lucas Gordon hailing from Colorado Springs, Colorado, having previously played in the metalcore band The Murder Formula. Promptly after, guitarist Tavis Alley, who attended Brigham Young University at the time, was recruited to the Mile High City to finish the line up after responding to a Facebook ad from the band looking for guitarists.\nLucas Gordon comments on the change:\n\nThe change has been immense. We don’t recognize it all the time when we’re with each other most of each day, but when you step back to look at where Speakeasy Tiger started and the impact we’ve been able to make on the public in such a short time it’s one of the most fulfilling thoughts I can think of. That’s the reason why we make music- not only for our own lives but also to influence the lives of others.\nSpeakeasy Tiger released its debut album The Public on July 11, 2009. The album was an immediate success reaching the College Music Journal Billboard top 200 albums chart. It peaked at position 142 and was a top 20 add for the week of August 29, 2009.\nIn November 2009, the group went back into the studio to remaster the single off The Public entitled \"Oil Rising\" at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with producer Lee Miles. The single was released in April 2010 shortly before the departure of vocalist Kyle Simmons.\n\n\n=== Addition & Departure of Katrina Stone (2010) ===\nIn May 2010 after rumors of vocalist Kyle Simmons' struggles with other band mates the band revealed the vocalist's departure from the band. After canceling a string of tour dates, the group took a small hiatus to search for a new vocalist. In June 2010 Speakeasy Tiger announced the addition of frontwoman Katrina Stone as an indefinite member while assuring they would not be canceling summer tour dates on The Vans Warped Tour.\nNot long after the tour, however, Schmidt and Stone announced to the band that they were quitting, providing little explanation why. The band was in pre-production on a new EP at the time, but the project has since been abandoned.\nSpeakeasy Tiger has since been on hiatus.\nIn 2022, vocalist Kyle Simmons passed away aged 34.\n\n\n== Musical style and influences ==\nSpeakeasy Tiger blends a mix of several different genres together including American rock, pop, post-Britpop, and electro. Band members have stated various musical influences including Freddie Mercury, Cyndi Lauper, BT, Coldplay, The Killers, and Jimmy Eat World.\nSpeakeasy Tiger has been hailed for its use of the Keytar, an instrument which was popular in the early 1980s.\nFans and critics have often compared the group to Muse, The Killers, Paramore, No Doubt, and Blondie\n\n\n=== Music with a voice ===\nBand members have stated that when writing music, they feel compelled to create music that manifests feelings of love, compassion, and caring in listeners. The group has teamed with various non-profit organizations including Keep A Breast and online blogs including Vans Girls Blog to promote a national sense of community through music.\nDrummer Lucas Gordon quotes:\n\nWe make music we love.\nWith the people we love.\n\nFor the people we love.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nLucas Gordon- Drums (2008 – present)\nLauren Gale- Bass (2008 – present)\nTavis Alley- Guitar (2008 – present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nPeter Schmidt- Piano, Synth, Keytar (2008–2010)\nKatrina Stone- Vocals (2010)\nKyle Simmons- Vocals (2008–2010)\nElliott Peters- Guitar (2008–2008)\nBrett Peters- Drums (2008–2008)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Sore Throat EP (2008)\nThe Public (2009)\nOil Rising- single version (2010)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nAlter the Press 2009 Compilation\nKKBB Summer 2010 Compilation\n\n\n== Tours and festivals ==\nIndependently toured western United States September 2009\nIndependently toured the Southern United States October 2009\nIndependently toured the midwestern United States November 2009\nMonolith Music Festival 2009 *Monolith Festival 2009 Promo Video*\nVans Warped Tour 2010 appearing on the Kia Kevin Says Stage\n\n\n== Interviews and press ==\nKCSU Top 25 albums of 2009\n303 Magazine: Speakeasy Tiger Gone Hunting\nAbsolutepunk.net Unsigned Showcase: Speakeasy Tiger\nAlternative Press Issue 265: Warped Tour\n\n\n== References ==\n \nKyle Simmons leaves Speakeasy Tiger, band auditioning new singers\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpeakeasy Tiger official website\nSpeakeasy Tiger official Purevolume\nSpeakeasy Tiger official Youtube\nSpeakeasy Tiger fan generated and maintained webpage"

    "text": "Jenny and the Mexicats, previously known as Pachucos y la Princesa, is a multicultural band composed of English trumpeter and singer Jenny Ball, Spanish percussionist David González Bernardos, and the Mexican musicians Pantera (Alfonso Acosta) on guitar and Icho (Luis Díaz) on double bass. Their style blends elements of flamenco, jazz, folk, and cumbia, with lyrics in both English and Spanish. The band is considered independent, and it does not have a contract with any record company.\nIn 2012, Jenny and the Mexicats founded Mexicat Records. They moved to Mexico City, and released their self-titled debut album on their own label.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n2012: Jenny and the Mexicats\n2014: Ome\n2017: Mar abierto/Open Sea\n2018: Ten Spins Round the Sun (10 Year Anniversary Album)\n2019: Fiesta Ancestral\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Verde más allá\"\n\"Me voy a ir\"\n\"Flor\"\n\"Labios\"\n\"Boulevard\"\n\"Frenético ritmo\"\n\"Me and My Man\"\n\"La diabla\"\n\"El telón\" feat.

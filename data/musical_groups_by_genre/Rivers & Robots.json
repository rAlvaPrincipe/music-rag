    "text": "Rivers & Robots were an English worship band from Salford, England. The group formed in 2010, and released five independently-made studio albums.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThey were formed by Jonathan Ogden, lead vocalist, when he started recording under the name in 2010 in City of Salford, Greater Manchester, North West England. The group members who joined him were guitarist, David Hailes, bassist, Nathan Stirling, and drummer, Kelani Koyejo. Kelani left the group in February 2016 and was replaced by Caleb Choo in September 2017. David also decided to leave the band in August 2017, so the band was searching for a new guitarist for a while.\nIn October 2018 Rivers and Robots announced the joining of Philip Shibata as guitarist.\n\n\n== Music history ==\nThe band started musical recording in 2010, with their first album, The Great Light, that was released on 12 August 2011. Their subsequent album, Take Everything, was released on 20 July 2012. They released an extended play, Rivers & Robots, in 2013. Their third album, All Things New, was released on 8 July 2014. Their fourth studio album, The Eternal Son, was released on 20 May 2016, by Set Sail Records. Their fifth and last to date album, Discovery, was released on 14 September 2018, by Running Club Records.\n\nIn early 2021, Rivers and Robots officially announced a hiatus for the band on their website.« (...) We’ve learnt to recognise the times we’re sailing with the wind of God’s power and blessing, and to know when we’re sailing against it. And so, after much prayer and conversation, we believe the season is changing again and that it’s time for Rivers & Robots to take a hiatus. This isn’t a break-up, we’re all still friends and love and support each other just as much as ever. But after 10 years of Rivers & Robots as a project, we feel like it’s time to take a break from recording and touring for the foreseeable future. This is never an easy decision to make, and we know it will be sad news for many of our listeners.

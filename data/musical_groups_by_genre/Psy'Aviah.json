    "text": "Psy'Aviah is an electronic rock band from Antwerp, Belgium.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe band were formed in 2004. Later that year, they won the Studio Brussel Demopoll with the song \"The Future of the Sun\". In 2007, they teamed up with Len Lemeire (from Implant/32Crash fame) to record their first album Creationism.\n2008 saw them signing to the Alfa Matrix record label and the release of a new album, featurings and remixes.\nAfter the release of their album Entertainment Industries in 2008 Psy'Aviah performed on festivals such as BIMFest 2008, Waregem Expo Gothic Festival 2009, VK Concerts (support Subsonica), Hof Ter Lo (support  Emilie Autumn), etc..\nThe Psy'Aviah videoclip for their single \"Moments (feat. Suzi Q. Smith)\" got banned in 2009 by YouTube which spawned a reaction of disbelief and disapproval towards YouTube in both the press and in online communities.\n2010 brought the third album of Psy'Aviah entitled Eclectric, produced by band member Yves Schelpe and mastered by Geert de Wilde of IC 434 in Antwerp. Their third album contained a mix of electric eclecticism, showcasing varying styles while retaining a constant hint of darkness. They invited guests such as Jean-Luc De Meyer of Front 242 fame to sing on the track Ophélie, and Jennifer Parkin of Ayria who guested on the track Into The Game.\nThe album Introspection / Extrospection is the band's latest and was released November 25, 2011. It again features a wild range of styles as on Eclectric, and includes a track with Swedish model and ex-Ashbury Heights singer Kari Berg, Dutch singer Lis van den Akker from Dutch act Misery as well as Belgian MC's MC Dééjoohcéé & Thomas C. Beerten. The album is their third to be released on Alfa Matrix records. The first single Ok (including the remix by M.I.K.E.) and the track SOS Overdose attracted a great deal of attention before the album was actually released.\nIn 2012 A follow-up to the album Introspection / Extrospection was released in the form of a DJ-EP Ok / Virtual Gods DJEP with remixes by NUDE, Jan Vervloet. The EP included a cappella versions and dub version of the songs. Before the release the Jan Vervloet remix of the track Ok leaked out and was already being played in various dj sets and podcasts, among others in the one by Johan Gielen. Concertwise the band play at venues Nijdrop for the Pluto Festival and at Ancienne Belgique as support for Praga Khan.\nThe year 2013 brought the band to the classic venues Nijdrop for the audio visual Pluto Festival and at Ancienne Belgique as support for Praga Khan's special 25-year anniversary concert. Meanwhile, they've also released the Future Past Mini Album / EP which featured guest vocals by Kyoko Baertsoen, the founder of act Lunascape (band) and former member of Hooverphonic. The Future Past mini album spawned two music videos for the tracks \"Circles\" and \"Letting Go\", the latter one hand-drawn, animated and directed by Emily Weeks.\n2014 saw Psy'Aviah return to its core, with founder and producer Yves Schelpe writing and producing the tracks for the album The Xenogamous Endeavour. An album with guest vocals on all tracks, from the likes of Kyoko Baertsoen, Mari Kattman, Miss FD, Suzi Q. Smith, Lisa Nascimento, Lis van den Akker and more...!\nPsy'Aviah continued this path in 2016 with the release of Seven Sorrows, Seven Stars. An album with guest vocalist, from the likes of Kyoko Baertsoen, Mari Kattman, Miss FD, Suzi Q. Smith, Roeland van der Velde, and more...! The album was widely received as a \"5*-rated\" album, and a real contender for album of the year by reviewers.\n\n\n=== Live performances ===\nThe band has played several festivals and clubs during the years, including Nijdrop club, Trix/Hof Ter Lo, Vaartkapoen and Ancienne Belgique.

    "text": "First Light was an English funk project of Paul Hardcastle.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nPaul Hardcastle and Derek Green were originally members of the Brit funk band Direct Drive, however at the end of 1982, they decided to leave the band and become a duo. Following their formation, they released the single \"Don't Be Mistaken\". In early 1983, they released their eponymous debut album which featured the song \"Explain the Reasons\". It reached No. 65 in the UK Singles Chart the same year. The follow-up single was \"Wish You Were Here\"; which peaked at No. 71 on the same chart.\nAfter the release of their second and last album Daybreak in 1984, Hardcastle and Green parted ways. Green moved to other projects and Hardcastle pursued a solo career.\nIn 1989, Hardcastle resumed working on First Light. This time he worked with Kevin Henry who had previously provided vocals on his solo work. Produced and arranged entirely by Hardcastle, the new album You Had It All was issued on the Sgt. Peppers record label. Four subsequent singles from the album were released.\nIn 2010, Hardcastle released a jazz album under the name First Light called East to West.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nFirst Light (1983)\nDaybreak (1984)\nYou Had It All (1989)\nEast to West (2010)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nTime Machine – The Best of Direct Drive & First Light 1981–82 (2001)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFirst Light Discography at Discogs."

    "text": "Nick Jonas & the Administration was a band formed in late 2009 as a side project by Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers. Performers included singer, pianist, guitarist, drummer, and songwriter Nick Jonas, bassist John Fields, drummer Michael Bland, keyboardist Tommy Barbarella, and guitarist David Ryan Harris. Sonny Thompson replaced David Ryan Harris during the 2010 Who I Am Tour. The group was named after Nick Jonas's interest in the presidency.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Group formation ===\n\"I had written five or six songs that were on my heart, things that were just pouring out of me with this new and exciting sound\", said Jonas. \"They weren't necessarily right for the Jonas Brothers, but I thought they could be perfect for something else.\"\nThe band was announced on the official MySpace page of the Jonas Brothers on October 30, stating it was just a \"side project\" and that this was not the end of the band. \"I'm kind of modeling it after Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band\", Nick said. \"It's kind of the look we were going for stylistically on the album cover and just the project in general… [Springsteen] pours so much passion and emotion into all of his songs every night and I hope I can capture that too.\"\nThe Administration members Michael Bland, Tommy Barbarella and Sonny Thompson formerly played together in Prince's New Power Generation from 1991 to 1996. All three were original members.\n\n\n=== 2009–2010: Who I Am ===\n\nThe first single of the album \"Who I Am\" was officially released on December 3, 2009, followed by the release of the music video.\nThe group made its live debut performing a single of the same name on the Grammy Nominations Concert Live special Dec. 2 on CBS.\nJonas cut the album in eight days with producer John Fields, who also played bass. The album has 9 new numbers and a cover of the Jonas Brothers single \"Tonight\". Nick originally wrote the song World War III for the administration, but instead it was used on the Jonas Brothers album Lines, Vines and Trying Times.  He also wrote a song called Oval Office but the songs never appeared on the record because according to Nick the song didn't sound good. \"Rose Garden\" was the first song written for the album and was partly inspired by a difficult break-up. \nPreviews of the songs Olive & An Arrow, Last Time Around, State of Emergency, Stronger (Back on the Ground) and Vespers Goodbye were released online before the official album release. \nTheir debut album Who I Am was  released February 2, 2010 as a Standard Edition (CD) and Limited Edition (CD+DVD) and reached number 3 on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling over 80,000 copies.\n.\nNick promoted the album on February 2 during various mini live chats with Sonny Thompson. Nick performed with Sonny Thompson acoustic versions of the songs \"Last Time Around\", \"Who I Am\", \"Tonight\" during Radio Disney Total Access; he also promoted the album during TV performances.\nTheir single \"Who I Am\" was featured on Radio Disney Jams, Vol. 12, along with songs by other popular artists. Jams 12 was officially released on March 30, 2010.\nAs of May 2010, the album has sold over 151,000 copies in the U.S.\nIn January 2010, Nick Jonas & the Administration toured in support of their debut album, Who I Am.  Apart from guest appearances at specific events, it marks the first time Nick has toured without his brothers, Kevin and Joe. Kevin and Joe did appear on certain dates to sing a song with Nick. Frankie Jonas appeared on the last tour day. Diane Birch was the major support act of the tour.  The tour took place in small, intimate venues in the United States.\nWhile on tour Nick Jonas and the Administration performed new songs such as \"Stay\" (which he wrote and recorded while he was on tour; he performed it after January 6), \"I Do\" (performed on the last day of tour) and \"While the World Is Spinning\", \"A Lot of Love to Spill\", they also performed remixes of the Jonas Brothers songs \"Inseparable\" and \"Before the Storm\"; at the end of the tour they recorded the video clips for the songs \"Rose Garden\" and \"Stay\". The tour began on January 2, in Dallas, Texas and ended January 30, in Berkeley, California.\nOn March 2, 2010, they released the song \"Stay\" as a digital single and a digital EP. Nick said that the song will not be on the record because he wrote it too late. He also said that \"Stay\" \"is a song I wrote that day we had off in Washington. It came after some things that I was going through that really inspired it.. and I'm just in a good place right now and was able to get a song out of it, which is always nice.\"\n\n\n=== 2010: Jonas Brothers Live in Concert World Tour 2010 ===\n\nWhile announcing Nick Jonas' side-project Nick Jonas and the Administration, the brothers announced they were planning a world tour to take place during the summer of 2010.

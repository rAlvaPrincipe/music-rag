    "text": "The Symphony No. 8 of Roger Sessions was composed in 1968.\nIt is a work in two movements lasting together about fourteen minutes:\n\nAdagio e mesto\nAllegro con brio\nNoteworthy in the context of Sessions' symphonies is the use of maracas to accompany the theme in the first movement. Andrea Olmstead describes all of Sessions's symphonies as \"serious\" and \"funereal\", with No. 8 being one of four with, \"quiet reflective endings.\" No. 8 combines the, \"fearsome rhythmic and harmonic densities,\" of his maturity, \"with the extended melodic phrases,\" which were always characteristic of Sessions.\nThe symphony was premiered on May 2, 1968, by the New York Philharmonic conducted by William Steinberg.\n\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThe symphony is scored for a large orchestra consisting of three flutes (third doubling alto flute), three oboes, four clarinets (fourth doubling E♭ clarinet), four bassoons (fourth doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, four trombones, tuba, timpani, two percussionists, piano, harp, and strings.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nFrederik Prausnitz, conducting the New Philharmonia Orchestra. LP recording, 1 disc. Argo ZRG 702. Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation Series 3. 1973.

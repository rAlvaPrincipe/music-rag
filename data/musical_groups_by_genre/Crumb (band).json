    "text": "Crumb is an American psychedelic rock band. The group is a collaboration of Brooklyn-based musicians Lila Ramani (guitar, vocals), Jesse Brotter (bass, vocals), Bri Aronow (synthesizers, keyboard, saxophone), and Jonathan Gilad (drums), who met while attending Tufts University.\n\n\n== History ==\nRamani, Brotter, Aronow, and Gilad met at Tufts University, often living and playing together until 2016, when they developed and recorded a collection of songs Ramani had started writing in high school and college. The collaboration resulted in the bandâ€™s first two EPs, Crumb (2016) and Locket (2017), the latter of which was released while the band was split between Boston and New York. Both EPs were independently released, with limited vinyl runs and cassettes released by independent record label Citrus City Records.\nCrumb went on to release their debut full-length album, Jinx, on June 14, 2019. The album received positive reviews from music critics.\nOn March 10, 2021, the band released \"Trophy\", the first single since 2019. The music video was directed by Haoyan of America and features animations by Truba Animation. Their second full-length album Ice Melt was released on April 30, 2021.\nIn March 2024 the band announced their next album Amama and released a single of the same name. The second single called The Bug was released on April 24th. Their third studio album Amama was released on May 17, 2024. \n\n\n== Music style ==\nIndie Current described Crumb's sound on Locket as psychedelic slacker-rock. Paste magazine called their sound a meld of \"60s psych, loose jazz, and freeform indie rock into a soothing pop amalgamation.\" Others[who] described them as psychedelic jazzy lo-fi dream pop.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n Jinx (2019)\nIce Melt (2021)\nAmama (2024)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nCrumb (2016)\n Locket (2017)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Trophy\" (2021)\n\"BNR\" / \"Balloon\" (2021)\n\"Crushxd\" (2023)\n\"Dust Bunny\" (2023)\n\"Amama\" (2024)\n\"The Bug\" (2024)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Slug was an American noise rock group that formed in Los Angeles in 1988 by DJs from Loyola Marymount University campus radio station KXLU. Originally formed as an experimental noise collage trio utilizing metal percussion, feedback and primitive sound loops created via gouged children's and sound effect records, they subsequently added traditional instrumentation (two basses, two guitars, drums, vocals) to the mix.\nSlug self-released their first single on their own label Magnatone Recordings. After the release of their first album Swingers, guitarist Rich Alvarez left to pursue his own band Jackknife, and was replaced by Collin Rae, formerly of 4AD artist Ultra Vivid Scene.\nBefore the recording of their third album The 3 Man Themes, bassist Michael B.© left to be replaced by David Scott Stone.\nSlug disbanded in 1996. Stone would go on to work with the Melvins, LCD Soundsystem and other groups. Bassist Damian Romero continued his side noise/ambient project under the name Speculum Fight. Guitarist Todd Williams relocated to New York City to work as a film editor. Drummer Tomás Palermo moved to the San Francisco Bay area as a freelance writer on reggae for URB magazine and other publications. Guitarist Collin Rae moved to the Bay Area as well, performing in other groups as well as continuing his work as a professional photographer.\n\n\n== Members ==\nStephen Karl Ratter (vocals/percussion/keyboards)\nDamian Romero (bass)\nTomás Palermo (drums/percussion)\nTodd Williams (guitar)\nCollin Rae (guitar, 1992–1996)\nDavid Scott Stone (bass) (1993–1996)\nMichael B (bass, 1989–1993)\nRich Alvarez (guitar, 1989–1992)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSwingers CD (Piece of Mind Records, 1993)\n\n\"Messerschmidt\" (with Robert Hammer)\n\"Face Down\"\n\"Four By Four\"\n\"Lockjaw\"\n\"Go Tell (version)\"\n\"Hail America!\"\n\"Trafalgar Square\"\n\"Swingers\"\n\"Sore Thumb\"\n\"Painbaby\"\n\"Freak of Nature\"\n\"Aversion\"\n\"Elevator\"\n\"Breakneck\"\nThe Out Sound (PCP Entertainment/Matador, 1994)\n\n\"Ex-Chest\"\n\"Telephone Trouble\"\n\"Aurora F.\"\n\"Here and Now\" (with Thomas A.

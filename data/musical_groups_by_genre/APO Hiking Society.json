    "text": "The Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society, later popularly known as APO Hiking Society, or simply APO, are a Filipino musical group, that comprised Danny Javier, Jim Paredes, and Boboy Garrovillo. Today, the group consists of only Paredes and Garrovillo as a duo.\nAPO Hiking Society are regarded as one of the pillars and icons of Original Pilipino Music (OPM). The group was formed and had its fledgling beginnings in 1969 at the Ateneo de Manila High School, with 12 members: Lito de Joya, Sonny Santiago, Gus Cosio, Renato Garcia, Chito Kintanar, Kenny Borton, Bruce Brown, Butch Dans, Doden Besa, Ric Segreto Macaraeg, Jim Paredes, Boboy Garrovillo, and the 13th member, Danny Javier, who joined in college. The group's name was created from the acronym AMHS representing their school with a witty twist having an irreverent reference to the  Philippine revolutionary intellectual and hero, Apolinario Mabini, and later shortened to \"Apo\", an Ilocano term for a wise man or a Tagalog term for grandchildren, and later re-branded to \"APO\" (all caps). Contrary to popular belief, the \"Apo\" name was not a reference to the Philippines's highest peak, the potentially-active stratovolcano Mount Apo. The group's name and meaning was a joke for the fact that Mabini has been paralyzed by polio during the Philippine revolution and cannot use his feet for walking nor hiking, hence the name.\nAs the students advanced into college, their lead vocalist, Danny Javier joined the group. After graduation, the majority of its members left to pursue individual careers, with only three members remaining, made up of Javier, Jim Paredes, and Boboy Garrovillo.\nIn the span of their professional career, APO emerged as a principal adherent of the musical movement termed Original Pilipino Music (OPM), a term coined by Javier, a milieu in which their original musical contributions and cultural influence became essential. APO became involved in record production, talent management and organizing artists under the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit (O.P.M., acronym translation: \"Organization of Philippine Singers/musicians\"). The group expanded its activities into establishing and furthering the careers of new OPM artists in the Philippines.\nTo date, the group has released 27 albums in the five decades of their career. Two successful tribute albums were produced in 2006 and 2007 by their management group, featuring numerous young bands reinterpreting APO's expansive repertoire.\nThe group frequently utilized their brand name, \"APO\", as a clever component for Tagalog puns in titles for television shows such as their own noon-time variety shows, Sa Linggo nAPO Sila and 'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila, live programs and marketing materials, for example, as in nA PO, which transliterates as \"already\" (polite/formal usage).\nIn 2010, APO Hiking Society performed a series of concerts and the inauguration of Benigno Aquino III from February to June 30, 2010. Paredes and Garrovillo still remained active in show business and perform occasionally as a duo. In 2022, the group lost one of its members upon the death of lead singer, Danny Javier, due to a prolonged illness at the National Kidney and Transplant Institute on October 31, 2022, at the age of 75, as confirmed by his daughter Justine.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\nJim Paredes - vocals, composer (1969–present)\nBoboy Garrovillo - vocals, composer (1969–present)\nEarly member\nDanny Javier - lead vocals, composer (1969–2022; died 2022)\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name \"Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society\" was meant to be deliberately ironic since the historical figure, Apolinario Mabini, famously lost the use of his legs to polio.\nThe APO Hiking Society first gained recognition in 1973 when they gave a farewell concert at the Meralco Theater in Pasig, Metro Manila, Philippines. Just out of college, the group was the talk of the Ateneo de Manila University and adjoining campuses for their music and humor.\nIt was only when two of its four members were about to retire from the field of amateur music, however, that APO Hiking Society, then known as the Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society, finally had a citywide audience. One of them was scheduled to leave for Turkey as an exchange student. The other had a position waiting for him in his father's advertising firm.\nThe trip to Turkey did not materialize and APO, now a tentative trio, pushed on steadily towards fame and fortune.\nIn late 1978, APO Hiking Society nearly disbanded after Jim Paredes stormed out of a songwriting session. While asking Danny Javier for a 3 syllable word to fill in a line, he was provided the word \"katapusan\"; a four syllable word. The error went unnoticed until post-recording, where an irate Paredes noticed that the word had indeed one extra syllable more than what he had originally intended.\nLooking back, APO members Danny Javier and Boboy Garrovillo do not regret never having been regular wage earners. Their farewell concert, which had SRO audiences for two stormy nights, not unexpectedly became a hit record the following year.\n\n\n=== Achievements ===\nIn the three decades since that \"farewell\" concert, APO has made 22 record albums; hosted several television shows, including their own noontime Sunday show \"Sa Linggo nAPO Sila\" and noontime show from Monday to Saturday \"'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila\"; and launched hugely successful major solo concerts and countless provincial, dinner, and corporate shows. They have performed in over 50 cities in the United States, Canada, Singapore, Indonesia, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Japan to bring Original Pilipino Music to Filipinos.\nIn 1978, APO won 2nd Place winner in the Metro Manila Popular Song Festival (now MetroPop Song Festival from 1996 to 2003) for their runner-up song Ewan. The song was composed by Louie Ocampo.\nIn October 1987, during their annual US tour, APO became the first Filipino pop artists with Marco Sison to perform at the Main Hall of New York's prestigious Carnegie Hall. They also performed at the equally prestigious Massey Hall in Toronto, Canada's music capital. Both concerts and the other shows held during that particular concert tour were sold out. APO were also the first Filipino artists to perform in a public concert in Saudi Arabia. In 1987, they were one of the first Filipino artists to be recorded on compact disc. And in 1994, they were awarded the first Dangal ng Musikang Pilipino by Awit Awards - the Filipino equivalent of the Grammy. They have also been conferred the Tanglaw Ng Lahi Award, the highest accolade given by Jesuits in the field of culture and arts.\nAPO also earned international recognition for \"Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo\" was recorded by 15 Filipino artists in April 1986. A few months later, the English version \"A New and Better Way\" was launched in Australia. In February 1987, the first anniversary of the Philippines' People Power revolution, the song was released in London, England. The song's lyrics are embedded on Our Lady of Edsa Shrine's wall, the center of the revolution.\nIn 1998, APO and the now-defunct band Eraserheads teamed up for their first \"San Miguel Beer\" TV commercial, \"Homeboys.\" The concept of reviving and modernizing their originals by rock/alternative bands in the 1990s paved the way to two tribute albums by various bands entitled Kami nAPO Muna in 2006 and Kami nAPO Muna Ulit in 2007.\nIn 1999, APO was also a finalist at MetroPop Song Festival for their song finalist Dito Sa Kanto. The song was composed by Noel Cabangon, then Cabangon covered his version in 1999, then re-recorded a duet with Parokya Ni Edgar vocalist Chito Miranda in 2013 again.\nIn 2007, Jacee with the group was awarded as \"MYX Magna Award 2007\" in the MYX Music Awards 2007, achieving the best OPM pop music and his music and recording achievements in OPM history.\nIn 2009, APO was inducted to the Philippines Eastwood City Walk of Fame, contributing their singing, hosting, and acting skills.\n\n\n=== APO Tribute albums ===\nJust a few years after their hiatus, the tribute album Kami nAPO Muna was released in honor of the group. The Filipino musical artists who did their own unique renditions of APO songs includes: Imago, Orange and Lemons, Parokya ni Edgar, Kamikazee, Sandwich, Sugarfree, Itchyworms, Sponge Cola, Boldstar, Sound, Drip, Rocksteddy, Top Suzara, Barbie Almalbis, Kitchie Nadal, Shamrock, and The Dawn. Their second volume, Kami nAPO muna Ulit has also included their new members in the compilation album are True Faith, Silent Sanctuary, Concrete Sam, Up Dharma Down, Chilitees, The Bloomfields, Scrambled Eggs, The Spaceflower Show, and Hilera.\nAcoustic balladeer Noel Cabangon also had a tribute album to the Pinoy pop musical group, Throwback: Ang Songbook Ng APO. Released in 2014 through Universal Records, it features his cover versions of popular various APO songs.\n\n\n=== 2008–present: Reunions and occasional performances ===\nOn September 20, 2008, APO Hiking Society had a reunion concert called \"Apo of the Philippines\" which was held at the Araneta Coliseum to celebrate their 39th Anniversary. They sang all of the APO favorites and all songs from their past releases.\nOn February 7, 2009, APO performed in the Open Air FTI Complex in Taguig. The free concert was sponsored in cooperation with Taguig City Hall. One month later, the Eraserheads had their Final Set Concert.\nOn November 17, 2009, APO Hiking Society marked their 40th anniversary with a big concert at the SM North EDSA Skydome. It was called \"APO Kayang-Kaya Pa\". This was originally scheduled on September 26 but was rescheduled due to the Typhoon \"Ondoy\" (\"Ketsana\").\nFrom February 14 until the Inauguration of President Benigno 'Noynoy' Aquino III on June 30, 2010, APO Hiking Society performed a series of performances.\nAPO Hiking Society remained active nowadays, with Jim Paredes is still active in singing and also a photography hobbyist and political activist, while Boboy Garovillo has a career acting in both movie and television.\nDanny Javier created the Pidro: Ang Saplot Ng Bayan T-shirt line that would be chosen as the official shirt of the Philippine Centennial celebrations in 1998. He starred in Bangis on TV5 in 2010 and appeared in Season 3 of ASOP: A Song Of Praise Music Festival in 2014 as a guest judge. Javier later retired from both singing and acting. He died on October 31, 2022, due to his lingering illness.\n\n\n== Musical film ==\nIn 2012, a movie musical based on APO songs was released.  Titled I Doo Bidoobidoo, it was released on August 29.  The film was inspired by Mamma Mia, a musical that was based on and used ABBA songs, which later became a movie.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nCollector's Item (1975)\nSongwriter (1976)\nPagkatapos ng Palabas (1978)\nTen Years Together (1980)\nTwelve Years Together (1982)\nTrue To My Music (1983)\nFeet On The Ground (1984)\nMade in the Philippines (1985)\nDireksyon (1987)\nMga Kuwento ng Apo (1988)\nSongbuk ng APO (1991)\nPaskonAPO (1991)\n1-2-3 (1992)\nBarangay Apo (1993)\nDating Alternatib (1996)\nMismo!

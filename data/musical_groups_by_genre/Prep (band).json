The band members have diverse musical backgrounds; Havelock is a singer-songwriter, Myrddin specialises in classical music composition, Jambel works as a house DJ, and Radclyffe produces hip hop tracks. This eclectic mix contributes to their distinctive sound, blending elements of 1980s pop and contemporary R&B.\nThe band's name was inspired by a phrase commonly used by ap Myrddin. According to Havelock, ap Myrddin would often ask the group before performances or significant events, \"Have you done your prep?\" The term, a short form of \"preparedness\" or preparation, eventually became the name of the band. \nTheir self-titled debut EP, released in 2015, featured the single \"Cheapest Flight\", which gained traction online. The song's smooth production and catchy melodies resonated with a wide audience, helping the band establish a strong online presence and a growing fanbase. The band's early success was marked by extensive online streaming and positive reception from music critics, setting the stage for future projects.\n\n\n=== 2018–2020: Futures ===\nIn 2018, Prep released their first full-length album, Futures.

Tracks like \"Who's Got You Singing Again\" and \"Line by Line\" became fan favourites, noted for their catchy hooks and lyrical depth. The band collaborated with established artists and producers including AlunaGeorge and Dean, further enhancing their profile.\nThe success of Futures was bolstered by the band's live performances. Prep embarked on several tours, both in the United Kingdom and internationally, playing at various music festivals and venues such as the Java Jazz Festival in Indonesia and the Wanderland Music and Arts Festival in the Philippines. Their live shows were characterised by tight musicianship and engaging stage presence, further cementing their reputation in the indie pop scene.\n\n\n=== 2021–present: New Priorities ===\nFollowing the success of their debut album, Prep continued to build on their momentum. In 2021, they announced their second studio album, New Priorities, which was released in 2024. The band produced most of the album in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The album features collaborations with artists such as Anna of the North and Phum Viphurit, showcasing their ability to blend various musical influences seamlessly.\nNew Priorities received critical acclaim for its polished production and innovative sound.

They have also engaged in various collaborations, expanding their musical reach and exploring new stylistic territories. Their continued innovation and commitment to their craft have solidified their position as a notable band in the genre.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nPrep's creative process is highly collaborative, with each member contributing their expertise to the songwriting and production. The band often starts with jam sessions in the studio, where they develop initial ideas. These ideas are then refined and layered to achieve a polished final product. Their diverse musical backgrounds allow them to experiment and innovate, resulting in a sound that is both unique and cohesive.\nPrep's music is characterised by a blend of hypanogic 1980s pop (including city pop), R&B, and jazz influences. Their early tracks, such as \"Cheapest Flight\" and \"Who's Got You Singing Again\", showcased a vintage-inspired sound combined with elements of contemporary R&B and electronica. This combination provided a fresh take on familiar styles, resonating with a wide audience. Prep's sound is often described as \"retrofuturistic\", combining lush synths, groovy basslines, and other sophisticated arrangements. Some listeners have described their style as yacht rock or \"marina pop\", evoking images of carefree moments, such as long drives or watching sunsets. Lyrically, their songs explore themes of love, longing, and personal reflection, delivered with a sense of wistfulness and emotional depth.\nThe band's influences are eclectic, drawing from a wide range of musical styles and artists. They cite Bobby Caldwell, Steely Dan, Daft Punk, Mac DeMarco, Jamiroquai, Bill LaBounty, Boz Scaggs, Thundercat, Tyler, the Creator, and Maurice White as major influences, alongside jazz and classical composers like Bill Evans and Maurice Ravel.

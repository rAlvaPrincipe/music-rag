    "text": "Stella One Eleven were an Australian pop, rock band, which formed in September 1997. They released three studio albums, Mr Big Car (1999), In Your Hands (2000) and Stella One Eleven (October 2003). Three of the band's singles, \"Go Slow Girl\" (July 2001), \"Out There Somewhere\"/\"S.S.D.\" (October 2003) and \"She\" (March 2004), reached the top 40 on the ARIA Singles Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 they were nominated for Best Independent Release and Best Adult Contemporary Album for In Your Hands. At the previous year's ceremony their single, \"Only Good for Conversation\" (September 1999), was nominated for Best Independent Release. The group had disbanded by October 2005 with the members undertaking solo projects.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1997–2002: Formation, Mr Big Car and In Your Hands ===\nStella One Eleven were formed in September 1997 in Sydney when singer-songwriter Cindy Ryan went into a studio to record her debut solo album. While working with her session musicians, Ryan decided to form a pop rock band with them instead. Stella One Eleven's debut single, \"Hard\", appeared in 1998 and was followed by their first album, Mr Big Car, in 1999 on Candle Records.\nThe group's line-up was Bowden Campbell (ex-Front End Loader) on guitar, Pat Hayes (ex-Falling Joys) on bass guitar and backing vocals, Genevieve Maynard (ex-Bughouse) on guitar and backing vocals, Ryan on lead vocals and guitar, and Raphael Wittingham (ex-Clouds, Golden Rough) on drums. Most of the album's tracks were co-produced by Maynard with Tim Powles (of the Church); two tracks were produced solely by Maynard.\nAdditional singles issued from the album are \"Mr Big Car\" (June 1999), \"Only Good for Conversation\" (September) and \"She Lies\" (December). At the ARIA Music Awards of 2000, \"Only Good for Conversation\", was nominated for Best Independent Release.\nStella One Eleven released their second album, In Your Hands, on Wow Records in late 2000. The line-up was Hayes, Maynard and Ryan with Brian Cachia on drums and Sam Carter (ex-Dogbouy) on guitar. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 In Your Hands was nominated for Best Independent Release and Best Adult Contemporary Album.\nIt generated a top 40 single, \"Go Slow Girl\" (July 2001), on the ARIA Singles Chart, which was placed on high rotation by national youth radio station, Triple J. The album reached No. 13 on Alternative Albums Chart. The band wrote the theme song for National Youth Week in Australia and were appointed official Youth Week ambassadors for 2000. In October 2001 the group were guest programmers on rage.\n\n\n=== 2003–2005: Self-titled album to disbandment ===\nAfter a hiatus of two years the group reconvened to release their third studio album, Stella One Eleven, on 6 October 2003. Ryan had collaborated with outside writers including Mark Seymour (of Hunters and Collectors) on \"Cold\" and Paul Andrews of Lazy Susan on \"Paleface\" and \"Beautiful Boys\". It reached number 12 on the ARIA Australasian Artists Albums chart. Lucinda Gardiner of Oz Music Project described it as \"an unashamedly pop album that deserves more recognition then it will probably get... Ryan's lyrics are sweeter and more optimistic here than in previous recordings. There is none of the outward vitriol on [it] that is on their other albums.\"\nThey issued two singles – \"Out There Somewhere\"/\"S.S.D. (Sweet Sweet Darling)\" in October 2003 and \"She\" (March 2004) – the latter was produced by Paul Mac. Both singles reached the ARIA Singles Chart top 40.\nBy October 2005 Stella One Eleven had disbanded with both Ryan and Campbell releasing solo albums: Ryan's Love Hate Tattoo and Campbell's Crooked Mile.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCindy Ryan – lead vocals and guitar\nGenevieve Maynard – guitar and backing vocals\nPat Hayes – bass guitar and backing vocals\nSam Carter – guitar\nBrian Cachia – drums\nRaphael Wittingham – drums (Mr Big Car)\nBowden Campbell – guitar (Mr Big Car)\nBernie Hayes – lead vocals\nMary-Anne Cornford\nStuart Robertson\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== ARIA Music Awards ===\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music.

    "text": "The Poni-Tails were an American musical trio formed in Lyndhurst, Ohio. They are known for their 1958 major hit \"Born Too Late\".\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, the Poni-Tails – Toni Cistone, LaVerne Novak and Patti McCabe (Patricia Ann McCabe, 1939–1989) – started singing at Brush High School, which they all attended. Tom Ilius, a music publisher, had them signed to a local record label, Point Records, which released their first single, \"Your Wild Heart\" b/w \"Que la Bozena\" (the latter of which was written by the group). \"Heart\" was covered by the then-15-year-old Joy Layne and became a nationwide hit. The next release was \"Can I Be Sure\" on Marc Records, which was not a success; following this release Topinka left the group and was replaced by LaVerne Novak.\nSoon after this, the group signed to ABC-Paramount and released \"Just My Luck to Be Fifteen\", a flop. Following this was \"Come on Joey, Dance With Me\" b/w \"Born Too Late\". The B-side was the one that caught the attention of radio DJs and became the group's biggest hit, reaching #11 on the U.S. R&B singles chart and #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1958. Follow-ups \"Seven Minutes In Heaven\" (#85 Pop) and \"I'll Be Seeing You\" (#87 Pop) fared less well, and the group's last single, 1960's \"Who, When And Why\", did not chart.\nABC-Paramount attempted to sign the group to a further five-year contract, but they turned it down. The members left the music industry and pursued careers in other fields in Ohio. They reunited to play a Cleveland festival, Moon Dog Coronation ball, in 1997. A CD released by Poni Records with 12 tracks credited to the Poni-Tails contains only one Poni-Tails song (\"Born Too Late\") and 11 tracks recorded by other groups.\nIn 1991, LaVerne (Novak) Glavac was working for a real estate agent in Mentor, Ohio, and had five grandchildren. Toni (Cistone) Costabile was working at a high school in Shaker Heights, Ohio. Patti (McCabe) Barnes died of cancer on January 17, 1989. Tom Illius subsequently became a top executive with the William Morris Agency in Los Angeles. He died on September 7, 2011, in Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n== Members ==\nToni Cistone\nKarin Topinka (to 1958)\nLaVerne Novak (1958–1960)\nPatti McCabe\n\n\n== References =="

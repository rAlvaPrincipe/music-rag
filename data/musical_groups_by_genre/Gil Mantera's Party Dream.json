    "text": "Gil Mantera's Party Dream was an American electronic synthpop party band hailing originally from Youngstown, Ohio, United States.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGil Mantera's Party Dream spawned from a three-man act called \"Party Talk\" that played a one night show in August 1998 in Youngstown, Ohio at Cedars Lounge. The act consisted of Richard Elmsworth (Ultimate Donny), Glen Whiteweather (Gil Mantera), and Brian Gage (Tartron). Ultimate Donny described the band as, \"A joke band called Party Talk, playing retro '80s-style dance music and pretty much making jackasses of ourselves.\"\nThe group disbanded after Brian moved to California. With Gil and Donny, Party Talk regrouped a few months later to play a CD release show at the club, despite the fact they had no CD in the works. With the departure of their third member, Party Talk evolved into Gil Mantera's Party Dream, and the duo gained a reputation for their anything-goes live shows.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBest Friends – 2000, self-released CDEP, out of print\nOnce Triangular – 2004, self-released CDLP, out of print\nBloodsongs – 2005, Audio Eagle CDLP\nBallerina EP – 2008, digital self-release\nDreamscape – 2009, digital self-release and CDLP; Psychic Dog Records\nBloodbrothers – TBA, TBA CDLP\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMyspace account\nFat Possum Records site"

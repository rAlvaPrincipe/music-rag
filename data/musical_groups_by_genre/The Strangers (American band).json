    "text": "The Strangers were an American country band that formed in 1966 in Bakersfield, California. They mainly served as the backup band for singer-songwriter Merle Haggard, who named them after his first hit single \"(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers\". In addition to serving as his backing band, members of the Strangers also produced many of Haggard's records, sang lead vocals on select tracks, and co-wrote many of Haggard's songs with him, including the No. 1 singles, \"Okie From Muskogee\" and \"I Always Get Lucky with You\".\nFrom 1969 to 1973, they issued several records independent of Haggard, released on Capitol Records, and even had their own Top 10 hit single called \"Street Singer\" on the Billboard Hot Country Songs Chart. Three members of the Strangers would go on to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Between 1969 and 1987, the Strangers were voted Band of the Year by the Academy of Country Music eight times—more than any other group in history.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1960s ===\nLead guitarist Roy Nichols had previously played with the Maddox Brothers and Rose, Lefty Frizzell, Wynn Stewart, and Johnny Cash before playing with the Strangers from 1965 until 1987, when health problems forced him into retirement.  Duncan, Oklahoma-born steel guitarist Ralph Mooney (September 16, 1928 - March 20, 2011) had previously played with Wynn Stewart and written the song \"Crazy Arms\", and after leaving the Strangers recorded a duo album with James Burton and then joined Waylon Jennings band.\nNorm Hamlet joined the Strangers on steel guitar in 1967 and, shortly afterward, became its bandleader. Howard \"Jerry Ward\" Lowe was the Strangers original bass player and George French (March 6, 1926 - August 14, 1992) played the piano. But when Ward left, Willard \"Gene\" Price (February 27, 1944 - August 13, 2013) from Shamrock, Texas, replaced him on bass just in time for the Okie from Muskogee album in 1969, on which he also sang lead vocals. Tulsa, Oklahoma-born Roy \"Eddie\" Burris (October 27, 1931 - April 19, 2011), the drummer for the Strangers, co-wrote the title track \"Okie From Muskogee\" with Merle Haggard.\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nClair \"Biff\" Adam replaced Burris as the Strangers drummer in 1970 and also served as Merle's publicist and bus driver.  On the album, The Fightin' Side of Me, the Strangers added rhythm guitarist Robert \"Bobby Wayne\" Edrington (December 11, 1941 - September 21, 2009) from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and they got their own showcase on the instrumental \"Stealin’ Corn\".  A second rhythm guitarist, Marcia \"Nichols\" Ashcraft (May 23, 1950 - October 1976), also joined the band \n\nAfter Bobby Wayne and Marcia Nichols left, Ronnie Reno of Reno and Smiley and the Osborne Brothers  joined the Strangers on rhythm guitar, and he also produced Merle's duo album with Mac Wiseman as well as Merle's The Bluegrass Sessions. Ronnie would also sing lead vocals on albums like Merle Haggard Presents His 30th Album. Johnny Meeks, previously a member of Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps, the Champs, and Michael Nesmith and the Second National Band, played bass with the Strangers in the early 1970s and later got inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  After Meeks left, Jimmy Tittle played bass with the band. After leaving the Strangers, Tittle would go on to play with his father-in-law Johnny Cash. He was replaced by bassist Sherman \"Wayne\" Durham.\nSaxophonist Don Markham, who had played with Sly & the Family Stone, the Ventures, the Bakersfield Brass, and Johnny Paycheck played with the Strangers from 1974 to 2013.  In the mid-1970s, former Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys guitarist Estel \"Eldon\" Shamblin was invited to join the Strangers. After retiring from the Strangers, Eldon Shamblin would continue to perform with them whenever they played in Tulsa. Electric mandolinist Billie \"Tiny\" Moore also joined the Strangers during the 1970s. Like Eldon Shamblin, Tiny Moore had also been a member of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys.\nIn the late 1970s Decatur, Gordon Terry joined the Strangers on fiddle. Terry had previously played with Bill Monroe, Faron Young, and Johnny Cash.\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nAfter Gordon Terry left the band, fiddler Jimmy Belken joined. Belken had previously played with Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys as well as Mel Tillis and the Statesiders.  In addition to serving as Strangers bassist, Dennis Hromek would also sing some lead vocals at Strangers shows.  When Hromek left Bobby Wayne returned to the Strangers, this time playing bass.\nOther noteworthy members of the band included trumpet player Gary Church and keyboardist Mark Yeary, who also served as Merle's co-producer on his records. Clint Strong, who had studied under Stan Kenton, joined the Strangers on lead guitar during the mid-1980s. Sheril Rodgers, co-wrote with Merle and singer/songwriter Freddy Powers. Sheril toured with the Strangers as backup singer from 1983 to 1984 and co-wrote \"Let's Chase Each Other Around the Room Tonight\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums credited to the Strangers ===\n\n\n=== Singles credited to the Strangers ===\n\n\n=== Albums credited to Merle Haggard and the Strangers ===\n\n\n=== Singles credited to Merle Haggard and the Strangers ===\n\n\n=== Albums credited to Bonnie Owens and the Strangers ===\n\n\n=== Singles credited to Bonnie Owens and the Strangers ===\n\n\n=== Albums credited to Leona Williams and the Strangers ===\n\n\n=== The Strangers as Backing Band ===\n\n\n== Contribution to Merle Haggard Albums ==\n\n\n=== Songwriting ===\n\n\n=== Production ===\n\n\n=== Lead Vocal ===\n\n\n=== Liner Notes ===\n\n\n=== Merle call-outs ===\nMerle Haggard famously called out members of the Strangers by name on his records prior to their solos.

Below is a list of all the songs and Stranger call-outs Merle made over his career.

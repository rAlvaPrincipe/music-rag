    "text": "Picnic (Russian: Пикник), or Piknik, is a Russian rock band known for its unique style, a mixture of art rock, progressive rock and original Russian rock. The band was formed in 1978 in Leningrad, \nthough the members consider the band's official starting point to be Edmund Shklyarsky's arrival, in 1981, or the year the first album was recorded—1982.\nSome of their early songs are in Polish, due to Shklyarsky's paternal heritage.\nIn 2016, the band was barred from playing in Ukraine due to their performance in Crimea after it was annexed by Russia.\nMusic critic Andrei Burlaka notes the group as a cult phenomenon in Russian rock music.\nPicnic were set to perform at the Crocus City Hall on 22 March 2024 before a terrorist attack took place there, killing 145 people. On the afternoon of 24 March, it became known that Ekaterina Kushner, the assistant to the director of the group, had died in the attack.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent\n\nEdmund Shklyarskiy – vocals, guitars, keyboards (1981–present)\nLeonid Kirnos – drums, percussion (1982–1984, 1987–present)\nMarat Korchemny – backing vocals, bass (2003–present)\nStanislav Shklyarskiy – keyboards (2007–present)\nPast\n\nAlexei Dobychin – vocals (1978–1983)\nEvgeny Voloshchuk – bass guitar (1978–1984, 1985)\nSergey Omelnichenko – guitar, vocals (1978–1981)\nNikolai Mikhailov – flute, saxophone (1978–1981)\nAlexander Matskov – drums (1978)\nAlexander Kondrashkin – drums (1978–1979, 1980)\nYuri Danilov – flute, clarinet (1979–1981)\nAlexander Yevseev – drums (1979)\nNikolai Korzinin – drums (1979–1980)\nPyotr Troshchenkov – drums (1980–1981)\nPavel Kondratenko – keyboards (1980)\nAlexei Malkov – keyboards (1980)\nMikhail Panaev – vocals (1980–1981)\nAlexander Savelyev – guitar (1981–1990)\nSharifzhan Abdulov – drums (1981)\nAli Bakhtiyarov – drums (1981–1983)\nViktor Morozov – drums (1982)\nVadim Lebanidze – keyboards (1983)\nSergei Shepel – guitar (1983)\nVladimir Sizov – bass (1984, 1989–1990)\nViktor Sergeev – keyboards (1984)\nSergei Voronin – keyboards (1984, 1986–2006)\nAlexander Fedorov – drums (1984)\nViktor Evseev – bass guitar, backing vocals (1985–1988, 1990–1996), keyboards (2007)\nYuri Klyuchantsev – keyboards, saxophone, percussion (1986–1988, 1990–1996)\nVadim Ponomaryov – drums (1986–1987)\nAndrey Merchansky – guitar (1990–1994)\nAlexander Rokin – bass guitar, backing vocals (1996–1999)\nSvyatoslav Obraztsov – bass guitar, backing vocals (1999–2003)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDym (1982) (Дым)\nTanetz Volka (1984) (Танец волка)\nIyeroglif (1986) (Иероглиф)\nRodom Niotkuda (1988) (Родом ниоткуда)\nKharakiri (1991) (Харакири)\nNemnogo Ognya (1994) (Немного огня)\nVampirskiye Pesni (1995) (Вампирские песни)\nZhen-Shen (1996) (Жень-Шень)\nSteklo (1997) (Стекло)\nPit Electrichestvo (1998) (Пить электричество)\nThe Best (compilation, 1998)\nEgiptyanin (2001) (Египтянин)\nFioletovo-Cherny (compilation, 2001) (Фиолетово-чёрный)\nNastoyashchiye Dni 1982–1992 (compilation, 2002) (Настоящие дни)\nSmutniye Dni 1992–2002 (compilation, 2002) (Смутные дни)\nChuzhoy (2002) (Чужой)\nGovorit i Pokazyvayet (2003) (Говорит и показывает)\nTribute (Piknik songs performed by other artists, 2003) (Трибьют)\nTen Vampira (with Vadim Samoylov) (2004) (Тень вампира)\nKorolevstvo Krivykh (2005) (Королевство кривых)\nNovoyegipetskiye Pesni (remix album, 2005) (Новоегипетские песни)\nMrakobesiye i Dzhazz (2007) (Мракобесие и джаз)\nZhelezniye Mantry (2008) (Железные мантры)\nTeatr Absurda (2010) (Театр абсурда)\nTri Sudby (2011) (Три судьбы)\nPevets Dekadansa (2012) (Певец декаданса)\nChuzhestranets (2014) (Чужестранец)\nIskri i Kankan (2017) (Искры и канкан)\nV rukax velikana (2019) (В руках великана)\nVeselyi i zloi (2022) (Весёлый и злой)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (Russian)\nEdmund Shklyarskiy's official website (Russian)\nEnglish lyrics\nSong translations"

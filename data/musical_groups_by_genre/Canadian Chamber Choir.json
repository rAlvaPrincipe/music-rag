    "text": "The Canadian Chamber Choir (Choeur de chambre du Canada)'s mission is to build community through choral singing. The CCC is a national ensemble that provides a professional choral environment for Canadian singers, conductors and composers, and travels across Canada promoting Canadian choral music. Under the artistic direction of Julia Davids, the CCC convenes in different regions of Canada twice a year, offering concerts and mentoring choral practitioners of all ages and stages.\n\n\n== Projects ==\nThe CCC puts on two or three projects each year. Each project brings together 17 singers, an artistic director, and an accompanist from across Canada. Projects are usually seven to ten days in length and are put on in different regions in Canada. Singers will have received their music in the mail and learned it prior to arrival at the project. Upon arrival in the host city, they spend three to four days in rehearsal, hosted by a local school, choir, or community group. The CCC then travels to a few nearby towns on a tour, giving a combination of concerts and workshops throughout the province. Education is at the heart of the mandate of the CCC, and this model allows for an increasing number of communities and singers to have access to high caliber choral music.\nProjects could not be carried out if not for the generous support of sponsors. The Canadian Chamber Choir is a registered charity.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe CCC was formed in July 1999 by a group of Canadian musicians. The purpose of the choir was to provide professional choral opportunities to young musicians that lived in areas of Canada that were unable to support professional choirs. Their mandate was to organize and perform short intensive 'projects' two or three times each year.\nThe original artistic director was Montreal conductor, Iwan Edwards. In 2004, Julia Davids took over artistic responsibilities. Under Davids' leadership, the choir focuses on developing the choral art through education and outreach initiatives, in addition to striving for artistic excellence.\n\n\n== Past Projects ==\n\n\n=== 2013 ===\n12–20 October – BC Tour: workshops with Oak Bay High School Chamber Choir, University of British Columbia, North Van schools, St. Patrick Regional Secondary School, Douglas College; Capilano University; concerts in Vancouver, and Vancouver Island and Lower Mainland areas.

    "text": "The Gertrudes are a Canadian indie folk band from Kingston, Ontario, founded in 2008. From 2009-2012 they found significant placement on campus music charts, toured Canada coast to coast, and reached number 1 on the CBC R3-30 charts. From 2013 to 2020, they released and performed very occasionally, in connection with community issues. In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, a new phase of writing and recording began, resulting in the albums Emergency To Emergency in 2021 and Just to Please You in 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Gertrudes were formed in Kingston, Ontario in 2008. The band's name was a reference to a founding member's grandmother, who the family believes to be reincarnated in his sister of the same name. Musicians performing with the band varied from one show to the next, but core members included Greg Tilson (guitar, vocals), Annie Clifford (banjo, vocals), Lucas Huang (ukulele, percussion),  Jason Erb (piano), Matt Rogalsky (guitar, mandolin), Josh Lyon (trumpet, piano, accordion), Pete Bowers (percussion), Chris Trimmer (theremin), and Pim van Geffen (trombone), with Amanda Balsys (violin, vocals) joining in time for their first full-length release, Dawn Time Riot in 2010. PS I Love You were guest musicians on one track of Dawn Time Riot. Exclaim! called the album \"a meticulously crafted spectrum of modern folk sound\".\nTheir single \"All the Dollar Bills Sing Hallelujah\" debuted at the top of the CBC Radio 3 R3-30 chart in the summer of 2013. They also placed multiple albums on the !earshot campus and community music charts. In 2012 they played during the finale of the Vancouver Folk Music Festival alongside the Tao Rodriguez-Seeger Band.\nAfter their early years of regularly performing and recording, the band occasionally reassembled between 2013 and 2020 to contribute to community and activist projects, including providing the score for a 2014 documentary about the closure of prison farms across Canada, releasing a song critical of first Prime Minister John A. Macdonald's racist and expansionist policies in counterpoint to celebrations on his 200th birthday in 2015, and in 2016 releasing a song and music video to protest a plan to extend a road through Douglas Fluhrer Park in Kingston.\nDuring the global pandemic beginning in 2020, The Gertrudes began a new intensive phase of songwriting and recording, with recording sessions held in band members' gardens and homes. After several singles, including \"Parham\", a song with proceeds going to the Canadian Mental Health Association commemorating a shooting and arson that occurred in Parham, Ontario, the full album was released on November 26, 2021 on Wolfe Island Records.\nIn 2023 they released their fifth album Just to Please You on Wolfe Island Records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nThis Be Our EP (self-released, 2008) EP\nHard Water (Apple Crisp Records, 2009) EP\nEmergency to Emergency (2020) Single\nThe Other Side (2020) Single\nParham (2021) Single\nNew Carolina (2021) Single\n\n\n=== Studio Albums ===\nDawn Time Riot (Apple Crisp Records, 2010)\nTill the Morning Shows Her Face to Me (Apple Crisp Records, 2011)\nNeighbourhood  (Apple Crisp Records, 2013)\nEmergency To Emergency (Wolfe Island Records, 2021)\nJust to Please You (Wolfe Island Records, 2023)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMusic of Canada\nList of Canadian musicians\nList of bands from Canada\nCategory:Canadian musical groups\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

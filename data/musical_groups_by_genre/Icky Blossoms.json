The three became acquainted through the Omaha arts scene and Pressnall's sidebands Tilly and the Wall and Flowers Forever. In early 2012, Icky Blossoms signed to Omaha-based Saddle Creek, who released the band's self-titled, full-length LP on July 17, 2012. Produced by TV on the Radio multi-instrumentalist Dave Sitek, it is said to be an “album of sharp mechanical grooves and romantic attitude” by Spin magazine.\nThe Icky Blossoms' Song \"Babes\" was used in a trailer for the movie Sin City: A Dame to Kill For shown first at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014. The band's second album, Mask, was released on May 12, 2015.\n\n\n== References =="

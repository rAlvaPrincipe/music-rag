    "text": "Trace Repeat is a funk and soul band from Oakland, California. \n\n\n== Background ==\nTrace Repeat was founded in early 2015 by co-band leaders Wesley Woo and Zach Hing, drummer Ben Peterson, and ex-member/saxophonist Adam Dietz. The band began as a side project immediately following Woo's first tour to South by Southwest as a solo artist. The remaining band members (Dan Wilson, David Kaiser-Jones, Noah Foley-Beining, and Khrizia Kamille) joined the band after the original four members recorded and shopped around its first early demos in 2015.\nFounder and co-band leader Zach Hing parted ways with Trace Repeat in August 2018 due to personal differences. The band's recording and touring schedule continued uninterrupted with its five remaining members, and contributions from Zach Parkes (bass), Rei Otsuka (bass), and Shawn Miller (bass).\nIn early 2019 the band officially announced Rei Otsuka as its permanent recording and touring bassist.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Kollaboration ===\nTrace Repeat found its first early success in May 2016 after catching the attention of Kollaboration talent scout Lauren Lee, who helped the band reach the final round competition of Kollaboration STAR 2016.  After winning Kollaboration’s regional competition in San Francisco, Trace Repeat had their first break on a national stage with their performance at Kollaboration STAR 2016, sharing the stage with artists like JR Aquino, Paul Dateh, Jane Lui, and Tim DeLaGhetto.\n\n\n=== Asian American Empowerment ===\nFollowing their appearance at Kollaboration STAR, Trace Repeat continued to build momentum with the release of their Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign in January 2017. The campaign garnered media attention due to its focus on Asian American empowerment and the demasculinization of Asian American men in film and media. According to NBC Asian America, “While the band wasn't sure how people would respond to their overtly empowerment-themed campaign, the message resonated. Trace Repeat raised more than $8,000 — most of it from strangers — and surpassed their goal by more than 50 percent.”\n\n\n=== The Oaktown Sound (2017) ===\nTrace Repeat released their debut album The Oaktown Sound in September 2017. The album’s first print was released on CD, vinyl, and 3 ½ inch floppy disc. Alternative Press calls the album, “intentionally referential to some of the 50s and 60s R&B you might hear on a James Brown or Ray Charles record. A lot of that high energy James Brown intensity, underscored by that Clyde Stubblefield 'funky drummer' kind of attitude in the rhythm section.”\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Releases ===\n\n\n==== Singles ====\n\n\n==== Album ====\n\n\n===== The Oaktown Sounds (2017) =====\n\n\n== Band Members ==\n\n\n=== Current Members ===\nWesley Woo - voice, guitar (2015–present)\nBen Peterson - drums (2015–present)\nDaniel Wilson - tenor, baritone saxophone (2016–present)\nKhrizia Kamille - voice, percussion (2016–present)\nMaddie Liu - trombone (2019–present)\nRei Otsuka - bass guitar, keys, synth (2018–present)\nZach Thorne - trumpet (2018-present)\n\n\n=== Frequent Collaborators ===\nBrent Elberg - drums, keys (2019–present)\nJeremy Propp - drums (2019-present)\nAdam Thomson - bass (2018–present)\nShawn Miller - bass (2018–present)\nZach Parkes - bass (2018–present)\nAlex Jimenez - bass  (2019-present)\nChris Lundeen - trombone (2019–present)\nLindsay Alexis Smith - trombone (2018–present)\nOscar Villagrana - trumpet (2019-present)\nJosh Sherman - trumpet (2019–present)\nDevin Hollister - tenor saxophone (2019–present)\nNoah Rosen - tenor saxophone (2019-present)\nRocky Mandayam - alto saxophone (2019-present)\nGreg Yee - keys (2018–present)\nMario Noche - percussion (2018–present)\n\n\n=== Past Collaborators ===\nJae Jin - vocal, acoustic guitar (2019-2020)\nBrendan Dreaper - drums (2016–2017)\nCadence Myles - drums (2017–2018)\nChris Andersen - trombone (2018–2019)\nCierra Davis - drums (2017–2018)\nJesse Elkin Rubin - tenor, baritone saxophone (2017–2018)\nMatt Kelly - trumpet (2017–2018)\nWill Berg - alto saxophone (2017–2018)\nZach Zarcone - drums (2017–2018)\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nAdam Dietz - alto saxophone (2015–2016)\nDavid Kaiser-Jones - trombone (2016–2019)\nEllisa Sun - voice (2015–2016)\nHeather Michelle - voice (2015–2016)\nItoro Udofia - voice (2015–2016)\nNoah Foley-Beining - drums, keys, cowbell (2017–2019)\nZach Hing - voice, guitar, bass (2015–2018)\nFroilan Vicente - tenor saxophone (2017–2018)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Sinfonieorchester Basel (Symphony Orchestra Basel; Swiss abbreviation SOB) is a symphony orchestra based in Basel, Switzerland. Its principal concert venue is the Musiksaal of the Stadtcasino. In addition, the orchestra accompanies ballet and opera productions with Theater Basel, and records prolifically, often for Sony Classical. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe orchestra was founded in 1876, in the same year as the music hall Basel (Stadtcasino Basel) was constructed. During its history, the orchestra gave the world premieres of works by such composers as Béla Bartók, Arthur Honegger and Bohuslav Martinů. The orchestra holds its present name Sinfonieorchester Basel since 1997, when the two orchestras Basler Sinfonie-Orchester and Radio Sinfonieorchester merged into one ensemble. Another milestone in the history of the orchestra was set in 2012, when the Sinfonieorchester Basel and the organizer of many years AMG (in German Allgemeine Musikgesellschaft Basel) decided to go separate ways. Henceforward, the Sinfonieorchester Basel has been organizing its own subscription concerts.\nFrom 2009 to 2016, the orchestra's chief conductor was Dennis Russell Davies.  In June 2015, the orchestra announced the appointment of Ivor Bolton as its next chief conductor, as of the 2016–2017 season, with an initial contract of four years.  Michał Nesterowicz became the orchestra's principal guest conductor as of the 2016–2017 season.  Bolton is scheduled to conclude his tenure as chief conductor of the orchestra at the close of the 2024–2025 season.  In February 2023, the orchestra announced the appointment of Markus Poschner as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2025–2026 season.\n\n\n== Chief conductors ==\n\nMario Venzago (1997–2003)\nMarko Letonja (2003–2006)\nDennis Russell Davies (2009–2016)\nIvor Bolton (2016–present)\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe recording 'A different Schumann Vol. 1–3' was awarded the Diapason d’Or in May 2004.

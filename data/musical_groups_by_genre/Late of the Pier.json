    "text": "Late of the Pier was an English four-piece dance-punk band from Castle Donington, signed to Parlophone. Their debut album Fantasy Black Channel, produced by Erol Alkan, was released in 2008 by Parlophone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation, Zarcorp Demo and Fantasy Black Channel (2004–10) ===\nThe band formed in 2004, although some of the songs they perform were written before this, with some dating back to 2001. Their debut single, \"Space and the Woods\", was released through WayOutWest Records, and featured on the band's Zarcorp Demo EP in March 2007. The band's second single \"Bathroom Gurgle\" was produced by Erol Alkan and was released by Moshi Moshi Records in September 2007. Their third single, \"The Bears Are Coming\", was released on 12\" and download only, with 7\" versions being sold exclusively on their February 2008 tour. This was released through the band's own Zarcorp label. Their fourth single, a double A-side including a new version of \"Space and the Woods\" as well as \"Focker\", was released following a headline slot on the Levi's Ones To Watch tour.\nLate of the Pier opened 2007's Reading and Leeds Festivals on the NME/Radio One stage, while appearing on the festival's Republic stage the following year. The band have performed in support slots for Hadouken!, Soulwax, Justice and U.N.K.L.E., as well as supporting Kaiser Chiefs on their 2008 UK tour.\nTheir debut album, Fantasy Black Channel, was released by Parlophone on 11 August 2008. On 7 September 2009, it was voted winner of the Neptune Music Prize on the Drowned in Sound website.\nThey released a new single titled \"Blueberry\" as a digital download on 17 December 2009, and as a double A-Side in February 2010 with \"Best in the Class\". Following this release, the band concentrated on a number of side projects and personal work, and stated that it was unlikely that new material would be forthcoming.\n\n\n=== Side projects (2010–2015) ===\nLead singer Sam Eastgate featured on Filthy Dukes' track \"This Rhythm\" on their debut album Nonsense in the Dark, and produced Manchester indie pop band Egyptian Hip Hop's debut double A-side single \"Wild Human Child\"/\"Heavenly\". He also toured as part of New Zealand indie twee act Connan Mockasin's band on his 2010 album release tour around New Zealand.\nSam Potter co-wrote music on Franz Ferdinand's 2018 album Always Ascending, and formed tribute act A Tribute to February Montaine in honour of lo-fi pop artist February Montaine. He also ran Blackout, a music event that ran at London venue Oval Space, where anonymous musicians played in the pitch black. Ross Dawson did some session work and joined London based band Zibra in summer 2014, but left in early 2015.\nIn early 2015, Eastgate released the album Inji and its lead single \"Oino\" under the name LA Priest.\nOn 21 May 2015, the band's former label Parlophone announced the death of drummer Ross Dawson. A press release from the musician's family, via the label, stated that Dawson was \"involved in a very sudden and tragic accident\" on 15 May. Dawson's family write, \"Ross was a monumental force in the lives of everybody who knew him, multi-talented, modest, kind and generous; he loved and was loved by his family. The world has become a sadder place without him. He will be eternally missed by all who knew and loved him.\"\n\n\n=== Fantasy Black Channel reissue (2015–present) ===\nIn August 2018, the band resurfaced in a series of cryptic posts on a newly created Instagram account. In December 2018, the band announced a vinyl reissue of Fantasy Black Channel via Phantasy. Bundled with a download code for a digital album of unreleased demos and outtakes, the reissue was released on 19 January 2019.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nLate of the Pier's style has often been compared to artists like Gary Numan, Brian Eno, Stephen Dubrich, Bill Nelson of Be-Bop Deluxe fame, and the more contemporary Metronomy and Klaxons, mainly due to the prominent use of synthesisers in an off-kilter pop style.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n=== Demos ===\n2005: Refill Men Twist & The Zarcorp Legacy\n2007: Zarcorp Demo\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLate of the Pier on Myspace\nLate of the Pier at AllMusic \nLate of the Pier discography at Discogs"

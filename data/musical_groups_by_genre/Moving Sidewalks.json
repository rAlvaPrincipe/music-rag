    "text": "Moving Sidewalks were an American rock band formed in 1966 from Houston, Texas. They released several singles and an album, before bassist Don Summers and keyboardist Tom Moore were drafted into the army, bringing the band to an end. Vocalist/guitarist Billy Gibbons and drummer Dan Mitchell then formed band ZZ Top.\n\n\n== History ==\nGibbons founded Moving Sidewalks in the mid-1960s and they quickly drew a large following, especially among the Houston \"teen scene\".  They recorded several singles and one full-length album, Flash. Their single \"99th Floor\" was well received, and topped the charts at No. 1 in Houston for six weeks. The success of this record led them to sign with Wand Records, which then released \"Need Me\", also a Top 10 hit for the band. The group was asked to open for many rock tours, including Jimi Hendrix and the Doors.\nAfter Tom Moore and Don Summers were drafted into the United States Army, Gibbons and Mitchell added Lanier Greig and formed the original ZZ Top.\nWhile attending Warner Brothers' art school in Hollywood, California, Gibbons engaged with his first bands including the Saints, Billy G & the Blueflames, and the Coachmen. By 1967, Gibbons returned to Houston and formed an artfully designed band, conceptually inspired by friend and fellow musician Roky Erickson and the 13th Floor Elevators. 'The Moving Sidewalks' name was chosen, and shortly thereafter they recorded \"99th Floor\". Around this time Gibbons developed a camaraderie with Jimi Hendrix.  As a guest on The Dick Cavett Show, Hendrix deflected the implication that he was the greatest guitarist. He did not say who the greatest guitarist was, but a myth has circulated that Hendrix considered Gibbons the best, and stated so in an interview, but no such interview has ever been located.\nThe Moving Sidewalks continued to appear along with the 13th Floor Elevators at the short-lived yet Houston psychedelic venue, Love Street Light Circus, at Allen's Landing. One night, the Elevators set was cut short by Houston Police, who arrested the band's lead singer Erickson for marijuana possession.\nIn January 2013, Gibbons announced the Moving Sidewalks would reunite with all original members for one show on March 30, 2013, at B.B. King's Blues Club in New York City.  Since that successful sold out show and despite their single show announcement, the band played as official headliners of Austin Psych Fest on May 1, 2013, and the Charity Gala for The Deacons of Deadwood Ball on September 28, 2013, in Houston.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nFlash (1969) Tantara TS 6919.

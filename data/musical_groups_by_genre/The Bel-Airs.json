    "text": "The Bel-Airs were an early and influential surf music band from South Bay, Los Angeles, active in the early 1960s.\nThey were best known for their 1961 hit \"Mr. Moto\", an instrumental surf tune that featured a flamenco-inspired intro and contained a melodic piano interlude. The song's theme was used in the solo for the song \"Seed\" by Sublime.\nUpon splitting up, guitarist Eddie Bertrand formed Eddie & the Showmen in 1964, while guitarist Paul Johnson later joined Cat Mother & the All Night Newsboys in 1970.  Original Bel-Airs drummer Dick Dodd joined Bertrand in Eddie & the Showmen, and later joined the Standells, playing drums and singing lead on their major 1966 hit, \"Dirty Water\". Richard Delvy replaced Dick Dodd on drums, Randy Nauert replaced Steve Lotto on bass, and Art Fisher replaced Eddie Bertrand on guitar. Delvy, Fisher Nauert and Roberts went on to found the surf group The Challengers. \nJohnson has continued in music, both in recording and as a performer.  Among other music associations, he has been a member of the \"Jim Fuller version\" of the Surfaris since 1990.  Bertrand also continued in music, touring as Eddie and the Soundwaves, among other performance configurations.  Dodd has participated in various reunions and later recordings of the Standells.\nEddie Bertrand died of cancer on October 27, 2012, at age 67.\nDick Dodd died of cancer on November 29, 2013, at age 68.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nEddie Bertrand (lead guitar)\nRichard Delvy (drums), replacing Dick Dodd\nDick Dodd (drums)\nGeorge Dumeshousen (drums)\nArt Fisher (lead guitar), replacing Eddie Bertrand\nPaul Johnson (rhythm guitar)\nSteve Lotto (bass, vocals)\nRandy Nauert (bass guitar), replacing Steve Lotto\nJim Roberts (piano)\nChas Stuart (saxophone)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\"Mr. Moto\" b/w \"Little Brown Jug\" (Arvee A-5034, 1961)\n\"Volcanic Action\" b/w \"Runaway\" (Arvee\tA-5054, 1962)\n\"Kami-Kaze\" b/w \"Vampire\" (Triumph TRI-54, 1963) (also included in Surfbeat by The Challengers)\n\"Charlie Chan\" b/w \"Baggies\" (Lucky Token LT-107, 1964)\n\"Liverpool\" b/w \"The Intruder\" (Lucky Token LT-111, 1965)\nCD compilations\nThe Origins of Surf Music 1960-1963 (Iloki IL-1007, 1993)\nVolcanic Action!

    "text": "Blackmore's Night is a British-American neo-medieval folk rock band formed in 1997, consisting mainly of Ritchie Blackmore (acoustic guitar, hurdy gurdy, mandola, mandolin, nyckelharpa, and electric guitar) and Candice Night (lead vocals, lyricist, and woodwinds). Their lineup has seen many changes over the years; Blackmore and Night have been the only two constant members. They have released eleven studio albums. Their early releases were mostly acoustic and imitated early music, but eventually Blackmore's Night started using more electric guitars and other modern instruments, as well as performing folk-rearranged cover versions of pop and rock songs. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early ===\nCandice Night was a Rainbow fan, and first encountered Ritchie Blackmore to ask him for an autograph in 1989, while she was working for a local New York radio station. The two started living together in 1991, and discovered they both had a passionate interest in Renaissance music.\nDuring the reformed Rainbow's recording of the album Stranger in Us All in 1995, on which Night contributed some of the lyrics and backing harmony vocals, the duo were already gearing up their debut album. In 1997, the project started as being a pun of their own names, which would consist of themselves plus session musicians.\n\n\n=== 1997 to 2005 ===\n\nTheir debut album Shadow of the Moon was a musical success and featured Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull on flute for the song \"Play Minstrel Play\". In subsequent albums, particularly Fires at Midnight, there was an increased incorporation of rock guitar into the music, while maintaining a folk rock direction. Over time, Night has increasingly participated instrumentally as well as singing the vocals, and is competent on a wide variety of Renaissance instruments.\nThe group performs at Renaissance fairs and Renaissance festivals, as well as in stand-alone concert tours in appropriate venues including \"castle tours\" of Europe, where they perform in historic surroundings for an audience dressed largely in period costume. The duo has been successful enough to inspire a number of international tribute bands including: Renaissance Night, the Italian Morning Star, The Midnight and Elflore.\nThey have also performed the music for MagiQuest, a live simulation game.\n\n\n=== 2006–present ===\n\nIn 2006, Night performed a duet with Andi Deris on Helloween's \"Light the Universe\", which was released as a single in certain countries and is available on their album Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy, released in the same year.\nOn 27 June 2008, the duo released its seventh studio album called Secret Voyage, a mix of medieval-sounding tracks and some contemporary ones. In addition to some covers of some traditional folk music (“Locked Within the Crystal Ball\" is from the fourteenth century) and some originals, Blackmore's Night also performed a cover of a Rainbow song (“Rainbow Eyes”) and an Elvis Presley cover (\"Can't Help Falling in Love\").\nA new album titled Autumn Sky was released at the end of 2010 in Europe and in 2011 in the U.S. This was followed by Dancer and the Moon, in 2013, an album featuring covers of songs by Randy Newman (\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\"), Uriah Heep (\"Lady in Black\") and another Rainbow song (“Temple Of The King”, originally from the album Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow).\nTheir album, All Our Yesterdays, was released on 18 September 2015. Their latest studio album, Nature's Light was released worldwide on 12 March 2021.\nIn 2022, Night was featured on the single \"We're Gonna Be Drinking\" with the German folkrock band dArtagnan from their album Felsenfest (2022). Blackmore's Night had previously made a version of the song on their 2003 album Ghost of a Rose called \"All for One\". A live version can be found on the DVD Castles And Dreams.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 5 October 2008, Night and Blackmore were married after 19 years together. This is the fourth marriage for Blackmore and first for Night. Autumn Esmerelda Blackmore was born on 27 May 2010. Their son Rory Dartanyan was born on 7 February 2012.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Members ===\nRitchie Blackmore – acoustic and electric guitar, mandolin, mandola, domra, hurdy-gurdy, nyckelharpa\nCandice Night – vocals, chanter, cornamuse, shawm, rauschpfeife, tambourine, woodwinds\n\n\n=== Additional personnel ===\nCurrent additional personnel\nBard David of Larchmont (David Baranowski) – keyboards, backing vocals (May 2003–present)\nEarl Grey of Chimay (Mike Clemente) – bass, mandolin, rhythm guitar (Feb 2008–present)\nTroubadour of Aberdeen (David Keith) – drums, percussion (2012–present)\nScarlet Fiddler (Claire Smith) – violin (2012–present)\nJessie Haynes – harmony vocals, rhythm guitar, and recorder (2022–present)\nFormer additional personnel\nScott Hazell – harmony & backing vocals (Jan 1997–Mar 2001)\nJessie Haynes – guitars, recorder, backing vocals (Jul 1997–Oct 1998, May 2022)\nMick Cervino – bass (Jul 1997-Aug 2000)\nJoseph James – keyboards (Jul 1997–Dec 1997)\nJohn O'Reilly – drums, percussion (Jul 1997–Dec 1997)\nSue Goehringer – backing vocals (1998–Mar 2001)\nRachel Birkin – violin (Sep 1998–Oct 1998)\nAlex Alexander – drums, percussion (Sep 1998–Jan 2000)\nAdam Forgione – keyboards (Sep 1998–Jan 2000)\nJim Hurley – violin (Jun 1999-May 2000)\nMarci Geller – keyboards, backing vocals (Jun 1999–May 2001)\nCarmine Giglio – keyboards, backing vocals (Apr 2000–Aug 2002)\nMike Sorrentino – percussion (Apr 2000–Aug 2001)\nChris Devine – violin, flute, guitar (Jul 2000–May 2002)\nSir Robert of Normandie (Robert Curiano) – bass, guitars, backing vocals (Oct 2000–2007)\nVita Gasparro (Lady Vita) – guitar, vocals (Jul 2001–Dec 2001)\nSquire Malcolm of Lumley (Malcolm Dick) – drums, percussion (Aug 2001–2011)\nLady Rraine (Lorraine Ferro) – harmony vocals (Apr 2002–May 2002, Oct 2007)\nLord Marnen of Wolfhurst (Marnen Laibow-Koser) – violin, flute, recorder (Jul 2002–Dec 2003)\nLady Nancy (Nancy Posner) – backing vocals (Jul 2002–2007)\nLady Madeline (Madeline Posner) – backing vocals (Jul 2002–2007)\nTudor Rose (Tina Chancey) – violin, flute (May 2004–2007)\nBaron St James (Barry Waller) – bass (Apr 2007–Mar 2008)\nGypsy Rose (Elizabeth Cary) – violin, backing vocals (Oct 2007–2011)\nLady Kelly De Winter (Kelly Morris) – French horn, harmony vocals (2012–Nov 2013)\nThe Minstrel Albert (Albert Dannenmann) – Bagpipes, Renaissance wind instruments, backing vocals\nStudio musicians\nPat Regan – various string instruments, keyboards (1997–2008)\nKevin Dunne – drums (1998–1999)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nShadow of the Moon (1997)\nUnder a Violet Moon (1999)\nFires at Midnight (2001)\nGhost of a Rose (2003)\nThe Village Lanterne (2006)\nWinter Carols (2006)\nSecret Voyage (2008)\nAutumn Sky (2010)\nDancer and the Moon (2013)\nAll Our Yesterdays (2015)\nNature's Light  (2021)\nShadow Of The Moon (25th Anniversary Edition) (2023)\nFires At Midnight (25th Anniversary Edition) (2024)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"List of Past members\".

    "text": "Remo Lauricella  (1912 â€“ 19 January 2003) was a British composer and concert violinist.\nHe was born in London in 1912, his father coming from Catania in Sicily. Lauricella's father Luigi, a successful tailor with a fashionable clientele, gave him his first violin lessons. He obtained a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London. He became a friend of Benjamin Britten who was a fellow student of composition under John Ireland. Later he studied at conservatoires in Siena and Santiago de Compostela.\nMuch of his career was spent as first violinist for the London Philharmonic, although he also played chamber music in many of the world's important music venues.\nBenjamin Britten wrote a Fantasy Scherzo for piano trio, retitled \"Introduction and Allegro\" (unpublished) dedicated to Remo Lauricella and Bernard Richards. It was first performed on 22 November 1986 by Marcia Crayford (violin), Christopher Van Kampen and Ian Brown (piano) (brother of Iona Brown famous violinist) at Wigmore Hall.\nLauricella died on 19 January 2003 in London. Upon his death, his antique Vesuvio Stradivarius (ex antonio brosa) violin, made by Antonio Stradivari in 1727 and previously owned by Jan Hambourg and Antonio Brosa, was left to the Italian town of Cremona. Cremona is both the birthplace of Stradivari as well as the place where the Vesuvio  was created.  Lauricella owned the Vesuvio since 1968.\n\n\n== Work ==\nAfrican Interlude, for violin and piano (dedicated to Jascha Heifetz)\nDanza siciliana for violin and piano\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Remo Lauricello, Selected Works\".

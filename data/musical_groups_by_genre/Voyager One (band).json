    "text": "Voyager One was an American indie rock band from Seattle, Washington formed in 1998. AllMusic compared the band's musical style to the shoegazing music played by Ride, Swervedriver and Catherine Wheel.\n\n\n== Band history ==\nThe band was formed in late 1998 by guitarist Jeramy Koepping and Peter Marchese on guitar and vocals. They recruited bassist Dayna Loeffler and a series of drummers before John Hollis joined the band. The band recorded a demo record Zeroes and Ones, Parts One and Two in 1999, which received airplay on Seattle independent radio station KCMU (now KEXP) leading to the band being signed to Loveless Records.\nTheir debut record From the New Nation of Long Shadows was released in 2000. Monster Zero followed in 2002 on Loveless Records, then followed by Dissolver on Tokyoidaho Records in 2005, and Afterhours in the Afterlife on Loveless Records in 2008. Several EPs have also been released as well as appearing on various compilations.\nVoyager One live shows typically included visual effects from several 16mm film projectors operated by Projectorhead. The projectors show spliced-together clips of salvaged short films on the wall behind the band. Projectorhead collects the source material for and assembles the films. Two video recordings of Projectorhead's work have been released on DVD, Shadows and Daydreams and Magic Time Bomb.\nVoyager One toured the U.S. west coast several times and toured the southeast states with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club on their Howl tour in 2006. The band also made several trips to festivals such as CMJ in New York City and SXSW in Austin.\nVoyager One went on an indefinite hiatus in 2011. At that time, the line-up included Jasun Hadaway and Elliott Nutt. Peter Marchese, Jasun Hadaway, and Elliott Nutt then formed a new band, Tokyoidaho. \nJeramy Koepping, who had started the band Grand Hallway with Tomo Nakayama in 2007, continued working with that band until 2011.  He now works with Matthew Emerson Brown (Trespassers William) and Joshua Morrison to score films and release music under the name St Kilda.\nJasun Hadaway and former drummer Tony Zuniga are currently members of Seattle band, Black Nite Crash.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nThe following musicians were members of Voyager One at various times:\n\nJeramy Koepping – guitar, bass, keyboards, loops, vocals\nPeter Marchese – guitar, vocals, bass, keyboards, drums, loops\nDayna Loeffler – bass\nJohn Hollis – drums\nTony Zuniga – drums\nCody Burns – bass\nMatthew Campbell – keyboards\nRick Lewis – keyboards\nJasun Hadaway – keyboards, sequencers\nElliott Nutt – drums\nDallas Guier – bass\nBo Gilliland – bass\nPeter Kerrick – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nFrom the New Nation of Long Shadows (2000, Loveless)\nMonster Zero (2002, Loveless)\nDissolver (2005, Tokyoidaho)\nAfterhours in the Afterlife (2008, Loveless)\nDemos and EPs\nZeroes and Ones, Parts One and Two (1999, Self-released)\nThe Magic Garden EP (2002, Arnold)\nBed of Sound EP (2007, Tokyoidaho)\nReassembled EP (2009, Tokyoidaho)\nGeography EP (2010, Tokyoidaho)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVoyager One facebook\nVoyager One Bandcamp page\nAllmusic.com article on Voyager One"

    "text": "Levi and the Rockats are a British rockabilly revival band originally from Essex. They are recognised as one of the pioneering neo-rockabilly groups of the 1980s.\n\n\n== History ==\nLevi & the Rockats were founded in 1977 by Levi Dexter, a Teddy Boy from Southend on Sea. His main influences included Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran and Elvis Presley, musicians popular among the 1960s British rocker subculture.\nIn December 1979 Levi & the Rockats disbanded and the Rockats continued under that name.\nLevi Dexter went solo and is still performing rockabilly music and was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall Of Fame.\nIn the 1980s, the Rockats opened for groups like Kiss, Iggy Pop, The Clash, David Bowie, Tina Turner, Thin Lizzy, and The Pretenders. After Levi Dexter left the band, it was re-formed with Dibbs Preston on vocals. This band is notable as one of the first rockabilly groups to incorporate punk rock and new wave influences to appeal to both punks and Teds, influencing later groups like Brian Setzer's Stray Cats and Dave Alvin's The Blasters, while retaining the raw authenticity of pre-British invasion Rock and roll.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe Rockats toured the UK, Japan and US. They also appeared on Andy Warhol's TV show in 1979 and were interviewed by Deborah Harry. Their most successful single was \"Make that Move\" which charted on the MTV charts in 1984, shortly after the band was signed on with RCA records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio recordings ===\n\"Room to Rock/All Thru the Nite\" (Peer Communications 1979)\n\"Rockabilly Idol/Note from the South\" (Peer Communications 1979)\n\"Rockabilly Doll\" 7\" (Kat Tale Records, 1980)\nMake That Move EP (RCA, 1983)\nDowntown Saturday Night LP (Jimco Records Japan, 1994)\nThe Good, the Bad, the Rockin' LP (Fury Records, 1997)\nTrue Hearted Woman EP (Downer Records Japan, 2000)\nRollin' Thunder LP (Downer Records Japan, 2001)\nWild Love LP (Blue Leaf Records, 2003)\nRockin' Together LP (Lanark Records, 2013)\n\n\n=== Live recordings ===\nLive at the Ritz LP (Island Records, 1981)\nLive at the Louisiana Hayride LP (Posh Boy Records, 1981)\nRaw in Japan LP (Jimco Records Japan, 1992)\nThe Last Bop - Farewell 1984 LP (Revel Yell Music Japan, 2003)\n\n\n== Members ==\nLevi Dexter - lead vocal\nDibbs Preston - lead vocal\nSmutty Smiff (Stephen Dennis Smith) - standup bass\nMick Barry - rhythm guitar, vocals\nBarry Ryan - lead guitar\nDean Thomas - drummer\nGuy Hemmer - rhythm guitar\nDanny B.Harvey - lead guitar\nLewis King (Curt Weiss) - drums\nIra Kaye - drums\nSteve Clark - drums\nJerry 'Nigs\" Nolan - drums\n\n\n== References =="

During this time the band embarked on various DIY tours around the US and released a split with Prince Daddy & The Hyena in 2016.\n\n\n=== Nothing but Love ===\nIn 2017 the band added vocalist Brond and saw the return of Kevin Prochnow on bass. On April 9, 2017, the band released three tracks promoting the upcoming album, Nothing but Love. The band continued to tour the US and gain traction at festivals like The Fest. Originally released in 2018 through Counter Intuitive Records the album was praised for its diverse, genre-blending sound. Just Friends continued to tour the US and the UK & Europe from Fall 2018 to early 2019. On February 14, 2019, the band announced they were signing to Pure Noise Records and re-releasing Nothing but Love on March 15 through the new label.

They were a dance and vocal unit of collective girl group E-girls alongside Dream and Flower. The group consisted of two vocalists and three performers at the time of their disbandment.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut and indie debut ===\nHappiness first appeared during Exile's 2008 Live Tour as backup dancers, at the time being a five-member unit consisting of Miyuu, Mimu, Karen, Sayaka, and Kaede. On April 10, 2009, it was announced that LDH would hold auditions to recruit vocalists for the new girlgroup, specifically aiming at girls aged 12–14. Yurino was then added to the group after an LDH Audition before the group was set to debut. They released their debut DVD single, \"Happy Talk\", on October 21, 2009. It was also used as the theme song for Japanese brand Mister Donuts.\n\n\n=== 2009-2012: Major label, first album Happy Time and E-girls formation ===\nMayu Sugieda was added to the group and announced on December 25, 2009, before the group made their major debut on February 9, 2011 with the release of their first major label single, \"Kiss Me\". Four days before their debut, the group held a live event to promote the upcoming release of their first single that attracted about 1000 spectators. The group released their 2nd single \"Friends\" on April 27 in the same year. Two days later, they held their first solo show at SHIBUYA-AX in Tokyo. For the release of their 3rd single  \"Wish\" on August 17, Happiness held their first surprise live event in front of SHIBUYA 109 in Tokyo, proving their popularity among teenage girls.

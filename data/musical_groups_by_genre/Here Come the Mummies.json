    "text": "Here Come the Mummies (HCTM) is an American funk rock band best known for its live performances and anonymous band members.\nThe band consists of various professional musicians based in Nashville, Tennessee. There are rumored to be several Grammy awards among the members, though this is difficult to verify, as the identities of band members are kept \"under wraps.\"  Members are believed to be under contract to various record labels, hiding their identities so as to prevent contract disputes while performing.\nAccording to the band's humorous promotional material: \"Some say [the band was] cursed after deflowering a great Pharaoh's daughter. Others claim they are reincarnated Grammy-Winning studio musicians. Regardless, HCTM's mysterious personas, cunning song-craft, and unrelenting live show will bend your brain, and melt your face.\"\n\n\n== Style and influences ==\nHere Come the Mummies' music is funk rock that incorporates elements of jazz, soul, ska and reggae.

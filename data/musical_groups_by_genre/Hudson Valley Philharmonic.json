    "text": "The Hudson Valley Philharmonic (abbreviated HVP) is a symphony orchestra based in Poughkeepsie, New York in the United States. It began in 1932, and it serves the Hudson Valley region.\nThe Philharmonic offers a series of concert performances at the Bardavon 1869 Opera House in Poughkeepsie as well as the Ulster Performing Arts Center in Kingston.\nThe orchestra has made regular guest appearances at festival venues, including SUNY New Paltz’s Piano Summer, at Bowdoin Park and the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1932, four Poughkeepsie businessmen who were also dedicated string players—George Hagstrom, Sydney Fleishman, Charles T. Miller and Dr. Charles Hoffman—formed the nucleus of local musicians that eventually evolved into the Dutchess County Philharmonic Orchestra (DCPO). With Hagstrom as its first conductor, the orchestra was made up of amateurs and professionals alike, plus a number of music students from surrounding high schools. In 1934, local backing enabled the DCPO to perform its first series of public concerts. By the 1940s, it had grown to 93 musicians. DCPO repertoire was largely classical, including some contemporary music and works by local composers.\nIn 1945, George Hagstrom stepped down as music director, handing the baton over to Ole Windingstad, formerly a conductor for the Oslo Philharmonic, Norway.  Windingstad also served as conductor to the New Orleans Philharmonic from 1940 to 1944. On October 29, 1953, under his direction, the orchestra presented a program of two Norwegian composers, Grieg and Sparre-Olsen, at New York's Carnegie Hall. It was also during Windingstad's tenure that the orchestra presented Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, narrated by former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt.\nBy 1959, Claude Monteux, world-class flutist and son of conductor Pierre Monteux, had elevated the orchestra to a fully professional ensemble, renamed the Hudson Valley Philharmonic Society, Inc. Under his baton, the HVP became a prestigious regional orchestra. The Young People's Concerts program offered today is a direct descendant of the school-day concerts introduced by Claude Monteux.\nImre Palló, formerly director of the German Opera on the Rhine and New York City Opera conductor, succeeded Claude Monteux as Music Director in 1976. Pallo introduced the first Hudson Valley Philharmonic opera series in 1978, and in 1979 established a pops series modeled after the successful Boston Pops.\nRandall Craig Fleischer became the third music director of the HVP during the orchestra's 1992 season and held the position till his death in 2020. Under Fleischer's leadership, the orchestra evolved into one of the region's major performing arts and educational assets.  During his tenure, a Juilliard teaching artist and affiliate of the New York Philharmonic redesigned the Young Peoples' concert program.  Each year, the program provides thousands of regional school children with the opportunity to view orchestral concerts.\n\n\n=== Subsidiary of the Bardavon ===\nIn 1998, the orchestra sustained a financial crisis, and in order to save the organization, local regional philanthropic foundations stated their willingness to commit substantial support provided the Bardavon would step in to reorganize and reinstate the orchestra. Both the New York State Legislature and private foundations aided the Bardavon to purchase the assets and name Hudson Valley Philharmonic, which officially occurred on June 3, 1999.\nIn March 2022, due to challenge with contract negotiations between the Bardavon and the Hudson Valley Philharmonic, the orchestra began to consider to legally separate from the Bardavon, a process which is still ongoing as of 2024. In the meantime, performances for the orchestra have been greatly reduced, to just three for the 2023-2024 season.[1]\n\n\n== Principal players ==\nThe current principal chairs of the orchestra are as follows:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBardavon 1869 Opera House website, accessed 16 May 2013"

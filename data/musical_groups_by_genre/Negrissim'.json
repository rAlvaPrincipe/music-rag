    "text": "Negrissim' is a hip hop crew from Cameroon formerly based in Dakar, Senegal, despite their members travelling regularly between Europe and Africa.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt all began in 1995 in Yaoundé where the young rapper SadraK from Douala met the Sassene brothers, Evindi and Sundjah:Negrissim' was formed and started spreading its message of hip hop from the bush all across the globe. Based in Dakar, Senegal since 2002, after 2 years on the road travelling through West Africa and picking up influences and experience along the way, their roots are both Cameroon and France. Their lyrics reflect both the joys and struggles of contemporary life, especially the clash between rural and urban life in Dakar, the melting pot of Africa.

He was trained as a violinist at the Conservatory of Music in Lahti (Lahden Musiikkiopisto) and later studied conducting at the Sibelius Academy with Jorma Panula in the same class as Esa-Pekka Salonen and Osmo Vänskä. Before becoming a conductor, Saraste was co-principal second violinist and later an associate to Leif Segerstam, with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra (RSO).\nIn 1983, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Saraste co-founded the Avanti! Chamber Orchestra, which specialises in performances of contemporary music. In 2000, Saraste also founded the Ekenäs Summer Concerts-Festival with the Finnish Chamber Orchestra, and he is currently the artistic advisor to both Festival and Orchestra. Saraste has directed the Finnish Chamber Orchestra on several tours, including tours in the United States and China.\nIn 1987, Saraste became the chief conductor of the RSO, and held the position until 2001.

He has twice recorded the complete symphonies of Jean Sibelius with the RSO.\nSaraste became Music Director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in 1994. The later years of his tenure were marked by strife over the orchestra's financial difficulties, several musicians' strikes, and his unsuccessful efforts to improve the acoustics at Roy Thomson Hall. During the 1999 labour dispute, Saraste had offered to serve as mediator in the situation. Saraste stepped down from his Toronto post in 2001.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, Saraste served as the principal guest conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. In August 2006, he became Music Director of the Oslo Philharmonic, with an initial contract of 5 years. In June 2009, his Oslo contract was extended through the 2012–2013 season.

In April 2022, the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra announced the appointment of Saraste as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2023–2024 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.\nSaraste was awarded the Finnish State Prize for Music in 2000. He has received a Doctor honoris causa from York University (Toronto), and he is a Sibelius Medallist. Other honours also include the Sibelius Prize, awarded in Norway.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nJukka-Pekka Saraste – Official Website\nKS am Gasteig Management agency biography of Saraste\nWDR German-language biography of Saraste"

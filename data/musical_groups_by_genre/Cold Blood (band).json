    "text": "Cold Blood is a long-standing R&B horn funk band founded by Larry Field in 1968, and was originally based in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. The band has also performed and recorded under the name Lydia Pense and Cold Blood, due to the popularity of their lead singer, Lydia Pense\n.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band first came to prominence in 1969 when rock impresario Bill Graham signed them after an audition, and they played the Fillmore West in San Francisco. Pense has been compared to Janis Joplin, and it was Joplin who recommended the audition to Graham.\nThe term \"East Bay Grease\" has been used to describe the San Francisco Bay Area's brass horn heavy funk-rock sound of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s; Cold Blood (formed in 1968) was one of the pioneer bands of this sound. Others were Chicago (formed in 1967) and Tower of Power (formed in 1968). The horn players for Chicago are Lee Loughnane on trumpet, James Pankow on trombone, Walter Parazaider on woodwinds (retired in 2017 due to a heart condition). All three are original band members. Loughnane and Pankow still are active with Chicago. Their unique horn funk-rock sound has helped Chicago sell over 100 million records and still remain active in touring. The Tower of Power horn players have performed with Cold Blood on a regular basis since the early 1970s. Skip Mesquite and Mic Gillette have been members of both Tower of Power and Cold Blood.\nThe band disbanded in the late 1970s. Pense suspended her music career in the early 1980s to raise her daughter Danielle, before re-forming the group in 1988. The band stabilized with its current membership in the 1990s. Cold Blood continues to record and perform today, and some former band members such as Raul Matute (and some from Tower of Power) appear on the band's most recent album.\nCold Blood were featured playing \"You Got Me Hummin'\" live in Fillmore: The Last Days, a documentary of the last concerts at the Fillmore West auditorium during July 1971.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\nOriginal band members were founder Larry Field (lead guitar), Lydia Pense (vocals), Danny Hull (tenor saxophone and songwriter), Larry Jonutz (trumpet; born March 15, 1947), Pat O'Hara (trombone; born May 25, 1946 (?), died August 1977 of an overdose), Raul Matute (Hammond organ, piano, arranger and songwriter, born February 19, 1946), Jerry Jonutz (baritone, alto and tenor saxophone; born March 15, 1947), David Padron (trumpet; born May 4, 1946), Rod Ellicott (bass), and Frank Davis, who was replaced on drums by Sandy McKee (real name Cecil James Stoltie, born July 12, 1945, died October 10, 1995) during the Sisyphus sessions.\nCurrent personnel are Pense (vocals), Steve Salinas (keyboards), Steve Dunne (guitar), Mike Morgan (percussion), Evan Palmerston (bass), Rich Armstrong (trumpet, cornet, percussion), Rob Zuckerman (alto, tenor, baritone saxes, and flute) and Donny Baldwin (drums).\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nOver the years there have been various incarnations of the band, including singer/trumpet player Max Haskett (born 7 March 1947, died 15 September 1999, ex-Rubicon); Tower of Power horn player Mic Gillette; Journey keyboardist Stevie \"Keys\" Roseman on Hammond B-3 organ; Sons of Champlin drummer Jim Preston; Starship drummer T.

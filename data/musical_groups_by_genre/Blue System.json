    "text": "Blue System was a German pop group that was founded by Dieter Bohlen in 1987 after the break-up of Modern Talking.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe group consisted of Dieter Bohlen (mastermind creator, composer, writer, producer, mixer, arranger and verse main vocals), and hired backstage musicians Rolf Köhler (chorus main vocals), Michael Scholz (background vocals), Detlef Wiedeke (background vocals) and other background and/or front female voices Tuti Kanta (\"Laila\", \"Only with You\"), Marion Schwaiger (\"Déjà vu\", etc.), Audrey Mountang and Madeleine Lang .\nOn stage: Joachim Vogel (rhythm guitar), Jeanne Dupuy and Frank Otto (drums), Nadja Abd el Farrag (vocals). In 1988 Frank Otto was replaced by Michel Rollin. After that in 1991 a new keyboardist joined for live shows – Achim Strieben. In TV shows and videos he was replaced by Friedrich Graner (Sir Fritz), who remained a part of the group until the break-up in 1998. In 1992 Dirk Sauer, Rene Engelman and Wolfgang Fritsch joined the group, while Joachim Vogel left.\nSome of the group's singles such as \"Sorry, Little Sarah\" or \"My Bed Is Too Big\" achieved moderate success in Europe. The group released 22 video clips from their album repertoire and most of these were aired in Europe, especially on German TV shows. Blue System also had several concert performances in Russia during the late 80s and early 90s.\n\n\n== List of band members ==\n\nDieter Bohlen – lead vocals, guitar, keyboards (1987–1998)\nFrank Otto – drums (1987–1989)\nJoachim Vogel – rhythm guitar (1987–1990)\nHusnu Baylav (Snoopy) – drums (1989)\nMichel Rollin – drums (1989–1998)\nJoachim Strieben – keyboards (1989–1998)\nLutz Krüger – vocals (1990–1991)\nWolfgang Fritsch – rhythm guitar (1990–1996)\nFritz Graner – keyboards (1991–1998)\nDirk Sauer – vocals (1992–1994)\nThorsten Feller – vocals (1994–1996)\nLars Illmer – vocals (1997–1998)\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n1987 Walking on a Rainbow (Hansa Records)\n1988 Body Heat (Hansa Records) [No. 23 Austria, No. 20 Germany]\n1989 Twilight [No. 30 Austria, No. 26 Switzerland, No. 11 Germany]\n1990 Obsession [No. 18 Austria, No. 14 Germany]\n1991 Seeds of Heaven [No. 12 Austria, No. 11 Germany]\n1991 Déjà vu [No. 18 Germany, No. 27 Austria]\n1992 Hello America [No. 29 Germany, No. 21 Austria]\n1993 Backstreet Dreams [No. 5 Germany, No. 22 Austria]\n1994 21st Century [No. 11 Germany]\n1994 X – Ten [No. 24 Germany]\n1995 Forever Blue [No. 18 Germany]\n1996 Body to Body [No. 29 Germany]\n1997 Here I Am [No. 38 Germany]\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nModern Talking\nEuro disco\nSystems in Blue\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBlue System at AllMusic \nBlue System discography at Discogs \nBlue System discography at MusicBrainz"

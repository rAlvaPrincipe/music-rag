    "text": "Matthews, Wright & King was an American country music group formed in 1991. The band, Raymond Matthews (born October 13, 1956), Woody Wright (born October 10, 1957) and Tony King (born June 27, 1957), was put together by Columbia Records producer Larry Strickland after Shenandoah left the label, as an attempt to keep a viable country band on that label. Wright had previously been in another band called Memphis.\nThough they enjoyed video success on CMT and TNN as well as touring with Reba McEntire for two seasons, their highest charting radio single, \"The Power of Love,\" peaked at No. 41 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 1992. It was the title track of their debut album, issued that same year on Columbia Records. The trio dissolved shortly after the release of their second album, Dream Seekers.\nSince disbanding, Tony King joined Brooks & Dunn's backing band and was also briefly engaged to Wynonna Judd, Woody Wright found success as a gospel songwriter, producer and solo artist, while Raymond Matthews returned to his native Alabama and a successful contracting business.\nIn 2013, Raymond Matthews and his daughter, Ashley Matthews Mobley, released an album entitled Come Home.  The album is a compilation of gospel songs written by Raymond. Production and recording took place at Dugger Mountain Music Hall near Heflin, Alabama.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Power of Love ===\n\n\n==== Musicians ====\nRaymond Matthews – Vocals\nWoody Wright – Vocals\nTony King – Vocals\nEddie Bayers – Drums\nWillie Weeks – Bass\nTom Robb – Bass\nSteve Gibson – Guitar\nBill Watson – Bass\nMark Casstevens – Guitar\n\n\n==== Production ====\nMarshall Morgan – Engineer\nToby Seay – Assistant Engineer\nJohn Kunz – Assistant Engineer\nDenny Purcell – Mastering\nCarlos Grier – Editing\nBill Johnson – Art Direction\nRollow Welch – Design\nRandee Saint Nicholas – Photography\n\n\n=== Dream Seekers ===\n\n\n==== Musicians ====\nEddie Bayers – Drums\nWillie Weeks – Bass\nMichael Rhodes – Bass\nBrent Mason – Electric Guitars\nRandy Scruggs – Electric Guitars\nDon Potter - Acoustic Guitar\nPaul Franklin - Steel Guitar\nMatt Rollings - Piano, Synth\nSteve Nathan - Organ, Synth\nRon Reynolds - Percussion\n\n\n==== Production ====\nRon Reynolds – Engineer\nGlenn Meadows – Digital Editing, Mastering\nBill Johnson – Art Direction\nRollow Welch – Design\nJodi Lynn Miller – Design Assistant\nPeter Nash – Photography\nTrack information and credits verified from Discogs, AllMusic, and the album's liner notes.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMatthews, Wright & King at Allmusic\nWoody Wright Official"

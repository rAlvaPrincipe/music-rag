    "text": "Tengger Cavalry was a heavy metal band originated from Inner Mongolia and Beijing and formerly based in New York state and Texas. They combine elements of the traditional music of Central Asia and music of Mongolia with heavy metal into a kind of folk metal that Billboard and CNN refer to as nomadic folk metal.\nThe band also recorded game soundtracks for Civilization 6 and Doom Eternal.\n\n\n== History ==\nTengger Cavalry was founded in March 2010 as one-man project by Nature Ganganbaigal. The band is named after the ancient Mongolian and Turkic deity Tengri.\nThe first international review of their debut demo album Blood Sacrifice Shaman by German heavy metal magazine Legacy in 2011 was cautiously optimistic about the band's potential. Later MTV did an interview with the band.\nIn 2012, a feature by UK magazine Terrorizer gave the band a wider international audience.\nMeanwhile, another UK magazine Metal Hammer commented on their music.\nIn 2014, Tengger Cavalry released their third album. Metal Hammer was again drawn to the new album.\nIn October 2015, CNN did a video interview with the band. On December 24, the group's debut concert at Carnegie Hall was featured in Noisey, The Village Voice, Loudwire and The New York Times.\nOn February 27, 2018, it was announced the band had broken up.

    "text": "Barcelona was an indie rock, pop, and new wave band from Arlington, Virginia consisting of Jason Korzen, Jennifer Carr, Ivan Ramiscal, and Christian Scanniello. The band addresses geeky themes in many of their songs, such as \"The Downside of Computer Camp\", \"I Have the Password to Your Shell Account\", and \"Paging System Operator\", about a boy who contacts someone in Sweden whom he believes to be an experienced cracker, using a BBS, only to find he is also a thirteen-year-old.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1998: Formation ===\nBarcelona was formed in 1998 by Korzen and Carr. The pair recruited Ramiscal and Scanniello and began writing and performing original songs that year. Later that year, the group met producer/engineer Trevor Kampmann (also known as Trevor Holland) and began work on its first LP, Simon Basic, which included the single Why Do You Have So Much Fun Without Me?.\n\n\n=== 1999: Simon Basic ===\nThe band signed to March Records in early 1999 and released Simon Basic in June 1999. The album takes its name from the Simons' BASIC programming language, developed for the Commodore 64. In the fall of 1999, it embarked on its first tour, mainly on the East Coast, but also including Chicago.\n\n\n=== 2000: Zero One Infinity ===\nIn 2000, the band began work on Zero One Infinity, again with producer Kampmann. The album includes I Have the Password to Your Shell Account (which received some circulation on the Internet), \"Studio Hair Gel\", \"Robot Trouble\" and \"Kasey Keller\", an ode to the American soccer player. \"Studio Hair Gel\" and \"Robot Trouble\" were both released as singles prior to the album and included remixes by Figurine, Dntel and Baxendale. The band toured again in the fall of 2000 on ZOI, and the album was well received.\n\n\n=== 2001: Transhuman Revolution ===\nBarcelona recorded Transhuman Revolution in 2001 again with Kampmann. The album includes the singles \"Everything Makes Me Think about Sex\" and \"Human Simulation\". Shortly after the album's release, the band played its final show at The Metro Cafe in Washington, D.C. in February 2002.\n\n\n=== Post-Barcelona ===\nKorzen formed Sprites with his wife, Amy Korzen. Both Scanniello and Ramiscal have contributed to the project.\nRamiscal formed The Positions.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJason Korzen\nJennifer Carr\nIvan Ramiscal\nChristian Scanniello\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSimon Basic (1999)\nZero One Infinity (2000)\nTranshuman Revolution (2001)\n\n\n== See also ==\nBarcelona, Seattle band formed in 2005\n\n\n== External links ==\nBarcelona on Myspace\nBarcelona at AllMusic"

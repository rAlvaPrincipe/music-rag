The album sold +86,635 copies and won in the category of Best Singer dressed at the SBS Music Awards. The other success of this album was \"Oh My Boy\". At the time it was already very difficult to finance the group, due to a scam that happened to a new company called \"Kiss Entertainment\".

Chakra members also suffered a lot of difficulties at this time, and the audience was almost indifferent to the actions of this Chakra trio; this caused Eun to leave the group.

    "text": "I Know Leopard were an Australian pop band from Sydney. The band was formed in 2012, and features Luke O'Loughlin on vocals and keyboards, Rosie Fitzgerald on bass and Jennifer McCullagh on violin and keyboards. They released their debut album, Love is a Landmine, in 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 2012 between friends Luke O'Loughlin, Matt DeGris, Jade Eley and Todd Andrews after they relocated from Adelaide to Sydney. O'Loughlin and Andrews had formed a punk band, These New South Whales, the year before – with O'Loughlin on drums and Andrews on guitar. Soon after they released their debut EP, Embers.\nIn 2014, the band signed to Ivy League Records, through which they released their second EP, Illumina. Shortly after this, the band saw the arrival of Jennifer McCullagh and the departure of Eley. The EP saw success on triple j, and the band won the Sydney slot for the 2015 Laneway Festival Unearthed competition.\nIn 2015, the lineup changed once again with the departure of DeGris and the arrival of Rosie Fitzgerald. Later in the year, the band released their third EP Another Life. The songs \"Close Your Eyes\", \"Perfect Picture\" and \"Another Life\" all received significant airplay on Triple J. The band released the singles \"Rather Be Lonely\" and \"Let Go\" in 2016 and 2017, respectively, with both singles also receiving strong airplay on triple j.\nIn 2018, the band released the song \"Landmine\", which would later come in at No. 177 in the triple j Hottest 200. The following year, the band released the singles \"Heather\" and \"Seventy Lies\", and in April 2019 they released their debut album Love is a Landmine. The album debuted and peaked at No. 39 on the ARIA Charts. The album was also nominated for the Australian Music Prize, and received Album of the Week at Sydney Community Radio station FBi Radio. The fourth single from the album, \"Everything Goes With You\", was released in August 2019 and was a nominee for the 2019 Vanda & Young Global Songwriting Competition.\nIn 2019, O'Loughlin and Fitzgerald announced that they had been in a romantic relationship for a few years. This relationship, and the breakdowns that happened around it, aided in the creation of music for their debut LP Love is a Landmine, which O'Loughlin described as \"therapy\". Andrews left the band in 2020 to focus on These New South Whales. In 2021, the band returned with a new single, \"Lover Automatic\". This was followed later in the year with a further two stand-alone singles, \"Day 2 Day\" and \"Good As What You Give\". The band released one last single, \"Nothing is Real\", and played a run of shows in late 2022 before quietly disbanding.\n\n\n== Touring ==\nThe band have embarked on several national tours over the years, including the Love is a Landmine album tour in mid 2019 selling out and playing to thousands of people across Australia, and the \"Everything Goes With You\" national tour in November 2019, named after a song from the band's debut album. The band have played a number of notable festivals, including  Lost Lands, Festival of the Sun and Beyond the Valley in 2019 and Party in the Paddock in 2020. The band supported A-ha and Rick Astley in February 2020.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nWhen the band originated, their sound was a blend of indie rock and dream pop. Later in their career, the band began to shift their sound towards more synth-based art pop and indie pop, as well as drawing upon 1970's era style soft rock.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Final line-up ===\nSource:\n\nLuke O'Loughlin – lead vocals, keyboards (2012–2022)\nJennifer McCullagh – violin, keyboards, backing vocals (2013–2022)\nRosie Fitzgerald – bass, synthesizer, backing vocals (2015–2022)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nMatt DeGris – drums (2012–2015)\nJade Eley – bass, backing vocals (2012–2013)\nTodd Andrews – guitar (2012–2020)\n\n\n=== Former touring musicians ===\nJack Moffitt – guitar\nLuke Davison – drums\nTully Ryan – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== National Live Music Awards ===\nThe National Live Music Awards (NLMAs) are a broad recognition of Australia's diverse live industry, celebrating the success of the Australian live scene.

    "text": "Trinity (stylized as TRINITY) is a three-member Thai pop boy band formed in 2019. The members were brought together by 4NOLOGUE label after the Nine by Nine special project ended in 2019. The group is composed of Third (Lapat Ngamchaweng), Porsche (Sivakorn Adulsuttikul), and Jackie (Jackrin Kungwankiatichai); with former member Jamyjames (Teeradon Supapunpinyo) departed from the group in August 2021.\nWhile primarily categorized as T-Pop, TRINITY's music incorporates elements of hip-hop, R&B, pop, and ballad, showcasing their diverse musicality. TRINITY aims to bring T-Pop to a global audience and redefine the image of Thai artists as internationally recognized professionals.\nAfter four years of participating in the entertainment industry and still counting, TRINITY has released one mini-album, one full-album, five singles, and several group and solo covers since their debut. They also held a full scale concert at Impact Arena (Bangkok, Thailand), three showcase stages in Thailand, toured in Vietnam, Japan,  and hosted a fan meeting in the Philippines.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThird (เติร์ด) – vocalist\nPorsche (ปอร์เช่) – rapper\nJackie (แจ๊คกี้) – vocalist\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nJamyjames/James (เจมส์) – rapper\n\n\n== Branding & Concept ==\nDuring their pre-debut training, the three founding members, Third, Porsche, and Jackie, selected the name \"TRINITY\" with the \"TRI\" prefix symbolizing the \"Three Musketeers\" theme.  This concept emphasized their commitment to constantly improving through teamwork, singing and dancing practices.\nWhen Jamyjames joined the group, the members decided to retain the name \"TRINITY\" but adapted the concept to a \"Four-side Pyramid.\" In subsequent interview, Porsche explained that a pyramid requires four sides for stability, reflecting their four-member composition as TRINITY. This concept inspired their group logo and the theme of their first mini-album, \"The Elements.\"\nFollowing Jamyjames' departure in August 2021, TRINITY rebranded their official concept and logo on November 28, 2021. Their logo now features three triangle shapes assembling together, \"alike the impeller which is ready to spin forward\". It reflects their three-member composition. An official logo of their fandom \"TWILIGHT\" was also unveiled on the same day. These changes and their conceptual underpinnings are reflected in TRINITY's official merchandise.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2019: TRINITY in Pre-debut Days ===\nAfter NINE BY NINE special project ended in March 2019, 4NOLOGUE formed its three exclusive talents in the group - Third, Porsche and Jackie - to take part in a new boy band.\nAs the members practiced and prepared for the debut, their official name \"TRINITY\", its official acronym \"TNT\", and the original concept (Three Musketeers) - were invented.\nDuring this time, Third, Porsche, Jackie regularly appeared together in many brand promotion events, namely as the brand presenter of Bento & Yamaha Thailand.\nMeanwhile, after ending his contract with Nadao Bangkok, Jamyjames chose to become an exclusive talent of 4NOLOGUE, and was included on TRINITY project. This explains the change of TRINITY's concept to \"Four-side Pyramid.\"\nTraining ceaselessly for more than six months, on June 4, 2019, Jamyjames - Third - Porsche - Jackie were officially introduced to the press as \"4NOLOGUE ARTIST,\" but the band name was unrevealed.\nMr. Wutt Anuwat Wichiennarat, CEO of 4NOLOGUE shared his vision with the press, after transforming 4NOLOGUE from an concert organizing agency to an artist management agency: \"We intend to pursue a music business by seriously pursuing music [...] Our music market is not dead. Artists still receive support from their fans, and fans still buy their CDs and concert tickets. We just have a duty to produce quality artists. Our artist training team is now a Thai team, we use the same system as the international market. We want to create a quality T-POP phenomenon.\"\n\n\n=== 2019: TRINITY Begins - \"The Elements\" Era ===\nOn the day \"TRINITY\" was announced, their hashtag \"#TRINITY_TNT\" reached No. 1 Trending on Twitter. Even though the members also work in various art categories, being a TRINITY member gives them a way to reload their passion together as music performers.\nOn September 13, 2019, TRINITY's first ever music video - \"Haters Got Nothing\" officially launched on Youtube.

The concept of the mini-album, as its name, is about four elements of nature that represents each member, according to their personalities:\n\nJamyjames is Wind (free-spirited and refreshing)\nThird is Earth (down to earth and caring)\nPorsche is Fire (passionate and strong-willed)\nJackie is Water (flexible and mysterious)\nAll four singles for their mini album has a focus on such elements.\nTRINITY performed their debut stage on September 17, 2019, at CentralwOrld Square (Bangkok, Thailand). On this day, James - Third - Porsche - Jackie performed live their four songs on the mini-album, and hosted their first-ever fansign event for 600 lucky fans.\nTRINITY also released their fandom name, \"TWILIGHT,\" sharing the fact that despite challenges, Twilight sky is always there to offers comfort and the promise of a brighter day ahead.\nFollowing the success of \"Haters Got Nothing\" music video, TRINITY soon released their second music video, \"IOU\".

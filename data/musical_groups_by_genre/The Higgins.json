    "text": "The Higgins are a multi-award-winning Canadian country music group from Delta, British Columbia.  The Higgins comprise three siblings: John (born June 4, 1982), Eileen (born July 17, 1986), and Kathleen Higgins (born November 11, 1988). They have charted a total of three singles on the Canadian Country Music charts, two of which were Top 15.  Videos for \"Flower Child\", \"Real Thing\", and \"Second Hand Car\" all went to No. 3 on CMT's Chevy Cross Canada Countdown.  The Higgins are songwriters as well as musicians, having written or co-written nine tracks on their national debut album Real Thing.  The Higgins were nominated for CCMA Group of the Year in 2008 and 2009, and have won six BCCMA awards including Album of the Year and Group of the Year (2008).\nThe group is best known for its vocal harmonies, and character onstage. The Higgins combine their country roots, pop influences and a Celtic family background into \"their unique musical sound\", and have been featured on TV shows and radio across Canada.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJohn Higgins – Vocals, Acoustic & Electric Guitars\nEileen Higgins – Vocals,  Mandolin, Tin whistle\nKathleen Higgins – Vocals, Acoustic guitar\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Higgins grew up in Delta, British Columbia, as 3 of the 7 siblings in their Irish/Hungarian family.\nThey began singing as young children, performing in local musicals and schools. They developed as musicians, matured as individuals, and committed their lives perfecting their music. The band's earliest incarnation included younger brother James, on drums, and their sister Mary on vocals. Mary left the group in 2005, in order to pursue other interests.\n\n\n=== Musical influences ===\nThe Higgins musical influences come from Emmylou Harris, Fleetwood Mac, the Dixie Chicks, The Corrs, James Taylor, Celtic, deep South traditional forms of folk, blues and country. They write, arrange and accompany themselves on a variety of both modern and traditional songs.\n\n\n=== Overcoming adversity ===\nIn 1998, John broke his back in a workplace accident, when a forklift crushed him in a bottle-recycling plant. It made him a wheelchair user for almost a year. Formerly a basketball hopeful, the 16-year-old had to find something else to do. A friend lent him a battered, acoustic, steel-string guitar while he was in his wheelchair, and he and his sisters taught each other to play. After John's recovery, the group worked hard on developing their distinctive sound, and discovered they had a creative skill for songwriting.\nJohn later became a spokesperson for WorkSafeBC, an organization dedicated to workplace safety. The Higgins performed at the WorkSafeBC 50th Anniversary, in June 2008.\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\nJust before their Canadian debut album, Real Thing, was released in June 2008, two-thirds of The Higgins had weddings. John was married in April, his new wife travelling with the group, working behind the scenes. Eileen followed suit and married in May 2008, though her new husband generally stays home while The Higgins go on tour.\nIn December 2008, Eileen announced on The Higgins' Myspace blog, that she and her husband Blake are expecting the birth of their first child in late February 2009.

    "text": "We Are King (also stylized as We Are KING), is an American R&B duo based in Los Angeles, California, consisting of twin sisters Amber and Paris Strother. Originally named King, the group also included their close friend Anita Bias. The Strother sisters are the nieces of the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based electric bluesman, Percy Strother, and are originally from Minneapolis.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe trio first appeared in 2011, when, on March 1, they independently released their The Story, a three-song EP that captured the attention and garnered support from a number of artists including Phonte of The Foreign Exchange, Questlove, Erykah Badu, and eventually Prince, who invited the two to open for him at his 21-Night Stand Tour at the Los Angeles Forum. Prince subsequently became the girls' mentor and advisor, providing them with managerial support until 2013. King founded their company King Creative in 2013, releasing their teaser single \"In the Meantime\" the same year, premiered by Billboard, and followed up with their second single, \"Mister Chameleon\" in 2014. On February 5, 2016, the trio released their debut studio album, We Are King, to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 59th Grammy Awards, making King the first independent band to be nominated in that category. We Are King was also included on mid-year and year-end lists by Rolling Stone, Time, Billboard, NPR, Spin, Newsday and Pitchfork among others.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nEPs\nThe Story (2011)\nSingles\n\"In the Meantime\" (2013)\n\"Mister Chameleon\" (2014)\n\"The Greatest\" (2015)\nCovers\n\nFela Kuti \"Go Slow\" (2014)\nDavid Bowie \"Space Oddity\" (2021)\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\nFeatures \n\nColdplay & We Are KING & Jacob Collier - \"Human Heart\"\nNicolas Godin featuring We Are KING - “Another Side\"\nRobert Glasper featuring We Are KING - “Move Love\"\nMiles Davis & Robert Glasper featuring We Are KING - \"Song For Selim\"\nThe Foreign Exchange featuring Paris and Amber Strother - “All the Kisses\"\nSam Sparro featuring We Are KING - “Outside the Blue\"\nDevin Morrisson featuring We Are KING - \"The Call (407)\"\nAlex Isley featuring Paris Strother - “So Here it Goes\"\n\nSongwriting, Musician, Vocal and Production Credits\n\nColdplay - “Coloratura\", \"Human Heart\" (from Music of the Spheres), \"Aeterna\", \"A Wave\" (from Moon Music)\nLeon Bridges - “Motorbike\", 'Details\", \"Steam\", \"Sho Nuff\", \"Don't Worry\"\nCorrine Bailey Rae - “Green Aphrodisiac\", \"Tell Me\", \"Horse Print Dress\", \"Been to the Moon\" (from The Heart Speaks in Whispers), \"Red Horse\", \"He Will Follow You With His Eyes\" (from Black Rainbows)\nMoses Sumney - \"Quarrel\"\nLogic - “Thank You\"\nBilal - “Right at the Core\"\nRobert Glasper Experiment - “Move Love\"\nJill Scott - “So Gone\"\nKendrick Lamar - “Chapter 6\"\nNick Hakim - \"Qadir\"\nBaby Rose - \"Show You\", \"Sold Out\", \"Pressure\"\nEric Roberson - \"Just Imagine\"\nAvicii - \"Lay Me Down\"\nKelela - \"Sorbet\"\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

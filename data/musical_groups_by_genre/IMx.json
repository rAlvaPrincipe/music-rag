    "text": "Immature (later known as IMx) is an American R&B boy band, managed by record producer Chris Stokes. Its members include Marques \"Batman\" Houston (born August 4, 1981), Jerome \"Romeo\" Jones (born October 25, 1981), and Kelton \"LDB\" Kessee (born January 2, 1981), all natives of Los Angeles, where the group was formed. The group released four albums under the Immature moniker: On Our Worst Behavior (1992; the only album to include original member Don \"Half Pint\" Santos, later replaced by Kessee), Playtyme Is Over (1994), We Got It (1995) and The Journey (1997).\nIn 1999, the group changed its name to IMx, marking ten years of being a group and released two studio albums Introducing IMx and IMx, as well as a Greatest Hits album in 2001. The group also branched out into film (such as House Party 3 and House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute) and television (such as A Different World, Sister, Sister, Family Matters, Soul Train and All That) before disbanding in 2002. \nOn November 6, 2013, Immature performed their first show since reuniting at Club Nokia in Los Angeles with Next and Dru Hill.

Holiday.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nImmature was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1991 by Marques \"Batman\" Houston, Jerome \"Romeo\" Jones and Don \"Half-Pint\" Santos. Kelton \"LDB\" Kessee (the group's drummer) joined the group full-time in 1994, replacing Santos due to his parents pulling him from the group after they starred together in House Party 3. In 1999, the group would change their name to IMx, feeling Immature no longer reflected the band.\n\n\n=== After IMx ===\nIn 2002, the group disbanded.

Houston later released five additional albums:  Naked (2005), Veteran (2007), Mr. Houston (2009), Mattress Music (2010) and Famous (2013).\nHouston and Jones have also pursued acting careers, with both starring in the dance film, You Got Served (2004).

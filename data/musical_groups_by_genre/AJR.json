    "text": "AJR is an American indie pop band founded by brothers Adam, Jack, and Ryan Met (né Metzger), collectively a trio of vocalists, multi-instrumentalists, and songwriters. The brothers grew up in New York City, primarily focused on busking and singing covers until shifting to songwriting and touring. At their home studio, they have recorded more than 100 songs and have released five studio albums on various record labels along with their indie label.\nAJR wrote \"I'm Ready\" and promoted the song onto Twitter in 2012, which led to Australian singer and songwriter Sia sharing her talent management network with the trio prior to the release. After the song became their breakout single on radio, AJR formed their own label AJR Productions and released three EPs—6foot1 (2013), Infinity (2014), and What Everyone's Thinking (2016). Since their debut, AJR has written or co-written every song in their five-album discography: Living Room (2015); The Click (2017); the two U.S. Billboard 200 top-ten albums—Neotheater (2019), OK Orchestra (2021); and The Maybe Man (2023). The 2017 electropop platinum album contained their first Billboard Alternative number-one song \"Sober Up\" (featuring Rivers Cuomo), and the 2021 orchestral pop gold album spawned—their first Hot 100 top-ten single and the Billboard Music Award Top Rock Song—\"Bang!\". AJR is a multi-platinum band for having seven platinum singles—including the three aforementioned songs; \"Weak\", \"Burn the House Down\", \"100 Bad Days\", and \"Way Less Sad\"—all of which accounted for eleven million certified units of their digital single sales in America.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2005–2013: Street performing and breakthrough with \"I'm Ready\" ===\n\nAJR, originally known as TB³ (Tapping Brothers to the Third Power), began street performing in the parks of New York City in 2005. Prior to releasing original music, they posted covers of popular songs onto YouTube, under the username of AJRbrothers. Jack revealed in 2017 that their cover of \"Ho Hey\" by the Lumineers later inspired pop singer Shawn Mendes to perform his own covers. In 2012, AJR self-released their first and eponymous limited edition EP in CD format.\nIn November 2012, Ryan tweeted a link to a video of their debut single, \"I'm Ready\", to about 80 celebrities, including Australian singer Sia. Sia told her manager about the song, and he contacted Steve Greenberg, former president of Columbia Records and current CEO and founder of S-Curve Records, who now acts as their manager. \"I'm Ready\", which features a sample of SpongeBob SquarePants repeatedly singing his catchphrase \"I'm ready\" from the eponymous animated series' premiere episode, was commercially released on August 22, 2013. The song was placed in regular rotation on Sirius XM Radio's Top 20 on 20 and Hits 1 stations, and they performed it on Good Day New York and VH1's Big Morning Buzz. The official music video for \"I'm Ready\" premiered on VEVO on October 15, 2013. It was certified Platinum in America and three times Platinum in Australia.\n\n\n=== 2013–2015: EPs and Living Room ===\n\nAJR released their second EP, 6foot1, on December 20, 2013, later being re-released as I'm Ready – EP via Warner Music Group on March 25, 2014. They were named Clear Channel's \"Artist on the Rise\" for the month of October 2013. By 2014, the band was named iHeartRadio's Artist of the Month for Top 40 in January.\nThe band's third EP, Infinity, was released on September 23, 2014. It contains 5 tracks, including the lead single \"Infinity\". A lyric video directed and produced primarily by AJR was released for the single. The EP was released instead of their debut album, Living Room, which was pushed back to a release date of March 3, 2015. The band expressed the delay in their debut album was because they wanted to add some of their newer music to the project. On October 23, 2015, they released the individual single \"Let the Games Begin\".\n\n\n=== 2016–2018: The Click ===\n\nOn September 16, 2016, AJR released their fourth EP, titled What Everyone's Thinking. It was preceded by \"I'm Not Famous\" as a single earlier in the year, followed by \"Weak\" as a single upon release. The latter became a hit, receiving Platinum certifications in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and the US, additionally generating over 250 million streams on Spotify within its first year. All five tracks from What Everyone's Thinking were included on AJR's second studio album, The Click, which was released on June 9, 2017.\nThe album, on the AJR Productions label, was released by S-Curve Records in the United States, Ultra Records in Canada, and Black Butter Records in the rest of the world. \"Drama\" was released prior as the album's third single, while \"Sober Up\" became the fourth single upon the album's release. The latter featured Rivers Cuomo and became AJR's and Cuomo's first chart-topping song apart from his band Weezer; atop Billboard's Alternative Airplay chart for two weeks in 2018.\nThe Click primarily stayed within AJR's signature pop sound. It was inspired by Fun, Twenty One Pilots, Kanye West, and Kendrick Lamar, stylistically incorporating hip-hop, electronic dance music, and jazz. In support of the album, AJR announced the Click Tour in late 2017, which embarked through North America in 2018. The album amassed over two billion streams on Spotify, while the tour sold over 100,000 tickets, featuring Hundred Handed, Grizfolk, Ocean Park Standoff, MAX, and Robert DeLong as opening acts.\nA deluxe version of The Click was released on September 21, 2018. The Click (Deluxe Edition) included three new tracks: \"Burn the House Down\", \"Role Models\", and \"Normal\". The former was released in March 2018 as a single, reaching number two on the Billboard Alternative Airplay chart. Also included was an acoustic recording of \"Pretender\", a collaboration from earlier in the year between AJR, EDM artist Steve Aoki and American rapper Lil Yachty. Due to a resurgence in popularity after four years, AJR released a music video for the album's second track, \"The Good Part\", on November 24, 2021.\n\n\n=== 2019: Neotheater ===\n\nOn January 30, 2019, AJR released the song \"100 Bad Days\", which would later become the lead single for Neotheater. A music video for the single was released on March 7. The song was additionally included on Taylor Swift's Apple Music playlist, \"Playlist by ME!\", in May 2019, with the pre-chorus' lyrics being used for Taylor's description of the playlist of songs she loves and appreciates.\nOn March 10, the band announced their third studio album, Neotheater, which was to be released on April 26. On March 12, the promotional single \"Birthday Party\" was released and \"100 Bad Days\" was performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.

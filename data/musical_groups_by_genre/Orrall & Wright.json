    "text": "Orrall & Wright was an American country music duo composed of Robert Ellis Orrall and Curtis Wright. Both members had recorded solo albums and had charted singles of their own prior to Orrall & Wright's inception. As Orrall & Wright, they charted two more singles and recorded a self-titled album on the Giant label.\nUnlike most other country music duos present at the time, Orrall & Wright's members shared lead vocals on every song that they recorded. Although active for only one year, they received a Duo of the Year nomination from the Country Music Association. By the end of 1994, both members resumed their solo careers. Wright joined the band Shenandoah, in which he served as lead singer until being replaced with Jimmy Yeary in 2007. After leaving Shenandoah, he joined Pure Prairie League. Orrall, meanwhile, has continued a solo career.\n\n\n== Orrall & Wright (1994) ==\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\n\"She Loves Me Like She Means It\" (Angelo, Robert Ellis Orrall, Billy Spencer) – 2:44\n\"The Last Time I Loved Like That\" (Orrall, Curtis Wright) – 3:50\n\"I'm Outta Here\" (T.

    "text": "Groove Armada are an English electronic music duo, composed of Andy Cato and Tom Findlay. They achieved chart success with their singles \"At the River\", \"I See You Baby\" and \"Superstylin'\". The duo have released nine studio albums, four of which have charted in the UK Albums Chart top 50.\n\n\n== History ==\nGroove Armada formed after Cato and Findlay had been introduced by a mutual friend and soon started their own club night in London, called Captain Sensual at the Helm of the Groove Armada, after a 1970s discothèque.\nBy 1997, they had released a few singles, including \"4 Tune Cookie\" and the song that first brought them minor fame, \"At the River\", which sampled \"Old Cape Cod\" by Patti Page. The song went on to be one of Groove Armada's best-known tracks and has been found on numerous chill out compilations.\nTheir first album, Northern Star, was released in 1998 on Tummy Touch Records, and was followed by a second, Vertigo, in 1999, which had a more mainstream and 'polished' sound, making the UK Album Chart's upper 20 and being certified silver in the UK. It also included \"At the River\" which was re-released as a full-fledged single. An album of remixed tracks from Vertigo entitled The Remixes followed in 2000, along with their contribution to the Back to Mine mix album series.\nThe next studio album Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub) was released in 2001 and marked a departure from their trip-hop roots to more upbeat music – as demonstrated on the Grammy-nominated single \"Superstylin'\". Another mix album followed, this time for the Another Late Night series, and in 2002, less than a year after Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub), Groove Armada produced Lovebox, which included a variety of genres including rock, such as \"Madder\" and \"Purple Haze\", while others were closer to the band's traditional house and trip hop roots, such as the title track \"Lovebox\", and \"Remember\", with the latter containing vocals made up entirely of samples of Sandy Denny's vocals for Fairport Convention. An additional bonus track was later released on their website entitled \"Fairport\". Lovebox also contained a song called \"Hands of Time\" which was subsequently used in the 2004 film Collateral.\nA greatest hits album, entitled The Best of Groove Armada, released in 2004 – the last of their releases with Pepper Records – before their studio album Soundboy Rock was released in 2007. The album marked a notable departure from the multi-genre-influenced previous album, featuring tracks such as \"Get Down\" and \"Groove Extracts\", which followed the contemporary house music trend, tracks with rock elements, and \"Song 4 Mutya (Out of Control)\" featuring the vocals of ex-Sugababes singer Mutya Buena, hailed by online music guide Popjustice as one of the best songs of 2007.\nFollowing the successful Soundboy Rock singles, an updated best-of set titled Greatest Hits was released in October 2007. This was accompanied by GA10: 10 Year Story, a 2CD rarities collection released in November 2007 to celebrate their tenth anniversary as a band. The band has spoken in-depth about the compilation, and cited it as an \"emotional experience\", with both members selecting their personal favourite songs and mixes from their history.\nGroove Armada also released a collaboration with The Japanese Popstars through Strictly Rhythm, via Beatport, in April 2008.\nIn the same year, Groove Armada engaged in a deal with Bacardi to distribute their new 4-track EP using a file sharing platform called B-Live Share.\nDuring 2009, Findlay and Cato repeatedly confirmed the existence of a pending new album. While on the Bacardi Express tour in Australia, Findlay said it will be called Black Light and \"is going to be the darker side of Groove Armada, which is finally coming out after 12 years.\" The first single, released on 23 November 2009, was \"I Won't Kneel\", featuring Groove Armada's new vocalist, Saint Saviour. The album's second single, \"Paper Romance\", was released on 22 February 2010, and the album was released in Europe on 28 February.\nIn October 2010, Groove Armada released a remix album, White Light, which contained recent studio re-recordings of alternative live versions of many songs from Black Light as well as other classic Groove Armada songs. Groove Armada headlined Uber Cool festival at Jersey Live on 3 September. The duo embarked on a series of secretive \"living room\" sets, performing intimately across the country for audiences of close friends. Little information was given about these private performances, but the tour kicked off in Brighton in late January, 2011.\nThe group has collaborated with a diverse array of artists, including Max Taylor, Neneh Cherry, DJ Gramma Funk, Sophie Barker, Nappy Roots, Fudge Dog, Sunshine Anderson, Mutya Buena, Jeru the Damaja, Richie Havens, Will Young, Brodanse and Joel Culpepper.\nIn February 2014, the EP Pork Soda was released. It included three brand new tracks: \"Pork Soda\", \"Hyde & Freak\" and \"Jack in Black\".\nIn 2015, Groove Armada released their eighth studio album, Little Black Book. The album has been described as \"somewhere between [an] album, mix CD, and compilation\". The first disc features their own original music and remixes, while the second disc features remixes of their music by other artists.\nGroove Armada released their ninth studio album Edge of the Horizon in 2020 featuring vocal performances from Nick Littlemore, James Alexander Bright, Todd Edwards, She Keeps Bees, Roseau, Paris Brightledge.\n\n\n== Other work ==\nFrom 1995 to 2000, Andy Cato was part of the progressive house music projects Mother's Pride and Qattara, and produced solo efforts under the aliases Caia and Journeyman DJ. In 2002, Cato collaborated with Rachel Foster, producing the album Pursuit of Happiness under the name Weekend Players. He also co-wrote with Sophie Ellis-Bextor on her album Shoot from the Hip, and released his first solo single under his own name, \"La Luna\". Cato has also worked with Róisín Murphy on her album Overpowered, producing the singles \"Let Me Know\" and \"You Know Me Better\".\nTom Findlay makes up one half of Sugardaddy with Tim Hutton, and has collaborated with Keeling Lee. In 2005, he set up Tunetribe, a music download store. Findlay has described working with Prince as his dream collaboration. In 2007, Findlay released Watch the Ride, a continuous mix album containing tracks by various artists, including his own project, Sugardaddy.\nIn 2011, Cato became the first musician to compose a ringtone for a charity, WaveLength Charity.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\nNorthern Star (1998)\nVertigo (1999)\nGoodbye Country (Hello Nightclub) (2001)\nLovebox (2002)\nSoundboy Rock (2007)\nBlack Light (2010)\nWhite Light (2010)\nLittle Black Book (2015)\nEdge of the Horizon (2020)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

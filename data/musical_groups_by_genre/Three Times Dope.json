    "text": "Three Times Dope was an American hip hop/rap group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania consisting of EST (Robert Waller), Chuck Nice (Walter Griggs) and Woody Wood (Duerwood Beale). 3xD, as they were called for short, were a part of the Hilltop Hustlers Crew (which also included Steady B, Cool C, Da Youngsta's and others). At first, they recorded under the name 3-D.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTheir debut LP, Original Stylin' was well-received, peaking at #122 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart and the group became well known for the terminology they created, such as \"Acknickulous\" and \"The Giddy Up\".\n3xD's follow-up album Live from Acknickulous Land was an attempt at a more serious work. Despite spawning two minor hits, it failed to chart on the Billboard 200. It did, however, peak at #30 on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Album chart.\n3xD later became closely associated with rapper/producer Kwamé. Their third album, Da Sequel, was not released until 1998.\nEST would eventually go on to become an award-winning songwriter for top-tier acts, such as Britney Spears with an unreleased song called \"Giving It Up For Love\" in 2004 but most notably a Grammy nomination in 2005 for Destiny's Child's \"Cater 2 U\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== As 3-D ===\n1987 Crushin & Bussin' (12\")\n1988 From Da Giddy Up (12\")\n1988 Original Styling (LP)\n\n\n=== As Three Times Dope ===\n1988 The Greatest Man Alive (12\")\n1988 Original Stylin' (LP)\n1989 Funky Dividends (12\") – #22 Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop\n1989 Original Stylin' (12\")\n1990 Live From Acknickulous Land (LP)\n1990 No Words (12\")\n1990 Mr. Sandman (12\")\n1990 Weak at the Knees (12\") – #41 Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop\n1991 Peace Ya'Self (12\") – #85 Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop\n1994 Da Sequel (12\")\n1999 The Sequel 3 (LP)\n\n\n== Sampling ==\nDelegation(UK) \"Oh Honey\" - \"Funky Dividends\"(1989)\nMarvin Gaye \"What's Going On\" - \"Increase The Peace\"(1989)\n\n\n== References =="

The band got its name from the middle school that all the members attended called Martha B. King Middle School. Before the band was known as We the Kings, the group went by the name Broken Image. The band's first tour was with Don't Die Cindy in the summer of 2005 where the group went by Broken Image, then later went under the moniker De Soto. The band A Heartwell Ending (later renamed Call the Cops) supported for the final leg of the tour. While teaming with Bret Disend in Fall of 2005, We the Kings went on its first tour under that name as a five piece, with the then-unknown Boys Like Girls as the group supported the new release of the Great Escape music video. We the Kings played on its first headlining tour Long Hair Don't Care with Valencia, The Cab, Sing It Loud, and Charlotte Sometimes during late March and throughout April.

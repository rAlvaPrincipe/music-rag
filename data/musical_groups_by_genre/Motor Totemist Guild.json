    "text": "Motor Totemist Guild is an American rock band, formed in 1980 in Orange County, California by band leader James Grigsby. Described as an avant-prog, avant-rock and chamber rock band, Motor Totemist Guild was noted for its songs that worked into epic durations and rich instrumentation but also forayed into free improvisation, sound collage, and other avant-garde techniques.\n\n\n== History ==\nBeing the only constant member, Grigsby assembled an everchanging lineup, that featured vocalist Emily Hay, as well as Rod Poole (acoustic guitar), Bridget Convey (piano), Hannes Giger (contrabass), and David Kerman (drums). Grigsby disbanded the group in 1989 to focus on the project U-Totem. Nevertheless, Grigsby and Hay reunited the group in 1997 with a largely expanded lineup, including former members Lynn Johnston (clarinets, saxophone) and Eric Johnson-Tamai (bassoon). The new lineup also featured musicians from 1990s West Coast new jazz scene, such as Vinny Golia (clarinets, saxes), Jeff Kaiser (trumpet), and Brad Dutz (marimba and vibraphone). All of the band's albums were released through Grigsby's own label, Rotary Totem.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJames Grigsby - composition\nEmily Hay - vocals\nRod Poole - acoustic guitar\nBridget Convey - piano\nHannes Giger - contrabass\nDavid Kerman - drums\nLynn Johnston - clarinets, saxophone\nEric Johnson-Tamai - bassoon\nVinny Golia - clarinets, saxophone\nJeff Kaiser - trumpet\nBrad Dutz - marimba and vibraphone\n\n\n== Discography ==\nMotor Totemist Guild discography as adapted from Discogs:\n\nStudio albums\nInfra Dig (1984)\nKlang (1985)\nContact With Veils (1986)\nElements (1988)\nShapuno Zoo (1988)\nOmaggio A Futi (1989)\nCity of Mirrors (1999)\nAll America City (2000)\nSingles\n\"Sub-Mission\" / \"Ballad of the Thin Man\" (1984)\nCompilations\nArchive One (1996)\nArchive Two (1996)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMotor Totemist Guild discography at Discogs"

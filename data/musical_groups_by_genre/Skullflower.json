    "text": "Skullflower is a British noise rock band, formed in 1987 in London, England. Led by guitarist Matthew Bower, the band attained a cult following with a sound based on \"sludgy, Black Sabbath-style riffs overlaid with feedback, fuzzed-out guitar noise, and throttling rhythms, all played at a high volume.\" Always an improvisational outfit, the band's music grew increasingly free-form over the course of their career, moving farther away from the rock music form.\nThe band's lineup has been fluid; the early core members were Bower, drummer and vocalist Stuart Dennison and bassist and guitarist Stefan Jaworzyn. Other contributors included guitarist Gary Mundy of Ramleh, bassist Alex Binnie, bassist and drummer Stephen Thrower of Coil, and auxiliary bassist, guitarist, and drummer Anthony DiFranco.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn an interview with The Guardian in 2016, the band was cited as being an influence to the American avant-garde metal group Neurosis.\n\n\n== References =="

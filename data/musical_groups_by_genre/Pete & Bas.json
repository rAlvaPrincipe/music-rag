They are notable for the songs such as \"The Old Estate\", \"Dents in a Peugeot\", and their debut single, \"Shut Ya Mouth‚Äù.\nThey released their first single in 2017 with \"Shut Ya Mouth\".

The song was an immediate success and went viral, prompting them to begin creating new music. They have also performed successfully in gigs and concert tours across major European cities and have over a million followers on Instagram.\nThe duo have collaborated with several notable artists.

They performed in local venues in the Los Angeles area until a music producer sent a demo tape they made to Michael Jackson himself. He later signed them to a record contract with his label MJJ music.\nTheir debut single \"Don't Stop\" was written and produced by Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins. It was a moderate hit with the Billboard pop and urban charts. Their debut album, \"Keep On\", was later released on the MJJ and Sony Work labels, with moderate success. After that, releasing a few other singles from their debut album that went uncharted. Josh Keaton, withdrew himself from the group and Godinez, Stretch and Zavatsky continued to stay with the group. Tommy McCarthy joined the group soon after Keaton left, and the group was signed to an album deal with Maverick. They released the single, \"Can I Get Your Number\", which was a moderate success in the pop charts. Their eponymous second album, on Maverick records did not do well at all commercially. The group disbanded shortly after this.\nJosh Keaton is known for being the voice of Spider-Man and Spyro the Dragon.

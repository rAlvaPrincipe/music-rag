    "text": "The Runners are an American electronic and hip hop production duo from Orlando, Florida, consisting of Andrew \"Dru Brett\" Harr and Jermaine \"Mayne Zane\" Jackson. Formed in 2000, their foray into musical production was inspired by Timbaland and the Neptunes. Their trademark is an exhale sound effect echoing \"Ahhh\" at the beginning of their productions.\nThe duo first became known for their credits on the 2006 single \"Hustlin'\" by Rick Ross and the 2008 single \"Go Hard\" by DJ Khaled, and gained further recognition for their extensive work on releases for both artists. They have since produced songs for artists including  Keyshia Cole, Cher Lloyd, Ace Hood, Chris Brown, Fat Joe, Juelz Santana, Nelly, Kevin Gates, Jim Jones, Lil Wayne, Fabolous and Usher. Their production often accomplishes songwriting from Kevin Cossom or Rico Love, while they often work in tandem with fellow Florida-based producer acts DJ Nasty & LVM, the Monarch and Cubic Z.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Runners first met as toddlers in Vero Beach, Florida. In 2000, they named themselves the Runners and set up shop in Orlando, where they launched Trac-N-Field Entertainment. In 2008, the Runners were nominated for Producer of the Year at the BET Awards.\nThey produced two tracks on Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud, \"Cheers (Drink to That)\" and \"California King Bed\". They have also produced British singer-rapper Cher Lloyd's debut single \"Swagger Jagger\". On March 31, 2012, they went in the studio to produce for Shakira. Although their work is primarily hip hop they have recently created several songs for TV including John Walsh's Americas Most Wanted intro. On October 7, 2014, they released their first original dance music track \"We Will Stand\" on Track Team Records.\nJermaine \"Mayne Zane\" Jackson performs and produces now as BLVK JVCK.\n\n\n== Production discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2006: \"Where Da Cash At\" (Curren$y featuring Lil Wayne & Remy Ma)\n2006: \"Hustlin'\" (Rick Ross)\n2006: \"Born-N-Raised\" (DJ Khaled featuring Trick Daddy, Pitbull, & Rick Ross)\n2007: \"All the Above\" (Beanie Sigel featuring R.

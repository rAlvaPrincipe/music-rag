    "text": "Metronomy are an English electronic music band, formed in Totnes in 1999. Their lineup consists of founding member and leader Joseph Mount (vocals, keyboards, guitar), Oscar Cash (keyboards, backing vocals, guitar, saxophone), Anna Prior (drums, backing vocals), Olugbenga Adelekan (bass, backing vocals), and Michael Lovett (keyboards, guitar). Their music consists of vocal and instrumental electronic pop music.\nMetronomy have released seven studio albums: Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe), Nights Out, The English Riviera, Love Letters, Summer 08, Metronomy Forever, and Small World. Mount has also released remixes under the band's name and has remixed songs by artists including Gorillaz, Sebastien Tellier, Roots Manuva, Franz Ferdinand, Klaxons, Goldfrapp, Young Knives, Zero 7, Ladytron, Kate Nash, Lady Gaga, and Lykke Li.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nAs a teenager, Joseph Mount began Metronomy as a bedroom project while he was still living with his parents in Devon. After having an interest in music from an early age, he \"drummed in a few bands at school and they all fell apart. Then I got an old computer off my dad and I started messing around when I was about sixteen or seventeen\". The name Metronomy was originally chosen by Mount and was said to be influenced by the band names of Autechre and Funkstörung.\nIn 2002, Mount moved to Brighton for his studies, while having a number of odd jobs, including one at a local HMV. Upon graduating, he became interested in music production and began \"soundtracking animations\". During his time in Brighton, Mount began to get involved with electronic music nights and performed as a DJ. At one of these gigs he was approached by \"some guy, [who] told me he'd put out a record. It turned out that of the songs I'd recorded, I had an album's worth\".\nIn February 2005, Metronomy released the debut album Pip Paine (Pay the £5000 You Owe) backed by the single \"You Could Easily Have Me\". After it had received limited attention, Mount began to build up a reputation for live shows. Initially, Metronomy was essentially a laptop/DJ act, although Mount soon asked his cousin Oscar Cash and an old schoolfriend Gabriel Stebbing to join him. Mount explained that \"I was doing some shows on my own (...), which was pretty crap, so I thought it would be better to get a band thing going on\".\nThe trio spent the next three years gaining live-experience while Mount recreated mixes for many other artists; contractual issues with the record company halted any new release. On remixing, Mount has said \"(b)asically, I only like remixers that really care about what they're doing. I can honestly say that I have got really involved in all of my remixes. If I've not got anywhere with one I will tell whoever it is that I'm giving up. That doesn't happen that often.\" Metronomy has \"a good strike rate\" in terms of remix work released. However, a DFA-inspired remix of U2's \"City of Blinding Lights\" was dismissed by their marketing manager and was not released.\nAlthough the band was now a three-piece live, in the studio Mount was \"still writing and recording it all on my own\" and \"influenced by people who’ve written, recorded and produced things all on their own, like Prince\". In 2008, the band released the singles \"My Heart Rate Rapid\", \"Holiday\", \"Heartbreaker\" (which feat. a Remix by Kris Menace), \"A Thing For Me\" and \"Radio Ladio\" and the full album Nights Out in September of that year. Kris Menace's Remix of \"Heartbreaker\" became Hype Chart Nr.1 in 2008. In May 2009, it was announced through the band's Myspace page that Stebbing would be leaving the band. Joseph wrote \"It's all very amicable and he's assured me he doesn't think he's fleeing a sinking ship.\" Stebbing is currently working with his own band, Your Twenties, which is being produced by Mount. Despite this, Stebbing reappeared to play bass for Metronomy for their appearance at the Far Out stage at Green Man 2010.\nIn 2011, the band released three singles \"The Look\", \"Everything Goes My Way\", and \"The Bay\" from their 3rd album The English Riviera which came out on 11 April. The album was the first to feature bassist Olugbenga Adelekan and drummer Anna Prior as band members, rounding out the band as a quartet.\nOn 23 January 2014, Metronomy's upcoming single Love Letters was named Zane Lowe's \"Hottest Record in the World\". In a telephone interview with the band, it was confirmed that the video would be directed by Michel Gondry. Their fourth studio album, Love Letters, was released on 10 March 2014, with the band achieving their joint highest ever position on the UK Albums Chart, at number 7.\nIn an interview with Crack Magazine, it was revealed that Metronomy would be releasing a new album in the summer of 2016. The title of the album was later revealed to be Summer 08, with its release scheduled on 1 July 2016. On 13 September 2019, Metronomy released their sixth studio album, Metronomy Forever. Their seventh studio album, Small World, was released on 18 February 2022.\nOn 12 March 2024, Metronomy announced that they had signed with Ninja Tune, while simultaneously releasing a new single collaboration with Pan Amsterdam called “Nice Town”.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\n\nMetronomy have toured widely throughout the UK and Europe supporting acts such as Coldplay, Bloc Party, CSS, Klaxons, Kate Nash and Justice. They engaged in their first headline UK tour in 2008. Metronomy have also played gigs in America and Canada notably at the 2007 SXSW.\nMetronomy's live shows include dance routines and light shows. Most notably they use push lights stuck to their chests. Mount explained: \"We did our first gig in Brighton, and a few days before I saw these lights in a pound shop and I thought 'we'll whack these on our t-shirts and do some synchronised light shows!' I'm totally aware that some people hate it but equally I think some people enjoy it just for the fact that it's a bit of fun.\"\nMetronomy performed at Field Day music festival in Sydney on New Year's Day 2012 and toured the UK in February 2012 with Two Door Cinema Club, Tribes and Azealia Banks on the NME Awards Tour 2012. They also performed at Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona in May 2014, at Rock Werchter in Belgium in June 2014 and at Festival No.6 at Portmeirion, Wales in September 2015.\nIn June 2022, Metronomy appeared at Glastonbury Festival.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\n\nJoseph Mount - lead vocals, keyboards, piano, organ, guitars (1999–present)\nOscar Cash - keyboards, guitars, saxophone, backing vocals (2005–present)\nOlugbenga Adelekan - bass guitar, backing vocals (2011–present)\nAnna Prior - drums, percussion, backing vocals (2011–present)\nMichael Lovett - keyboards, guitars (2018–present)\nFormer members\n\nGabriel Stebbing - bass guitar (2005–2009)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nPip Paine (Pay the £5000 You Owe) (2005)\nNights Out (2008)\nThe English Riviera (2011)\nLove Letters (2014)\nSummer 08 (2016)\nMetronomy Forever (2019)\nSmall World (2022)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nAntville Music Video Awards\n\nD&AD Awards\n\nMercury Prize\n\nNME Awards\n\nRober Awards Music Poll\n\nUK Music Video Awards\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nMetronomy discography at Discogs\nMetronomy's channel on YouTube\nInterview at musictowers.com\nInterview at nme.com\nSession for Planet Claire\nInterview on remixes with Vice magazine"

    "text": "Russkaja (stylized as ЯUSSKAJA) were a ska punk band from Vienna, Austria.  The band calls its sound \"Russian Turbo Polka Metal.\" It has drawn on polka, ska, fanfare, pop, rock, and traditional Russian music. The band was founded in 2005 by former Stahlhammer vocalist Georgij Makazaria. Signed to the independent Austrian label Chat Chapeau since 2006, they later changed to Napalm Records. They are most known in Austria for being the stationary band of the late-night comedy show \"Willkommen Österreich\".\nThe band broke up on February 3, 2023 (the same day they released their seventh album, Turbo Polka Party) because they no longer wanted to use their \"satirical use of Soviet symbols and language\" due to public criticism tied to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\tRusskaja live at Rockharz Open Air 2019\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nFinal lineup\nGeorgij Makazaria – vocals\nDimitrij Miller – bass\nEngel Mayr – guitar\nLea-Sophie Fischer - violin\nRainer Gutternigg – trumpet\nH-G.

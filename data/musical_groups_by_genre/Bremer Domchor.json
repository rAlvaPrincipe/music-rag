    "text": "The Bremer Domchor (Bremen Cathedral Choir) is a mixed choir at the Protestant Bremen Cathedral in Bremen, Germany.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first choir at the Dom was founded in 1684 by the theologian and church musician Laurentius Laurentii, who was responsible for music at the Domschule Bremen and the Dommusik. Today's choir was founded in 1856 by Heinrich Kurth (1828–1872), the music teacher at the Domschule. He was succeeded by Carl Martin Reinthaler (1857–1893), Eduard Nößler (from 1893), Richard Liesche (1930–1957), Hans Heintze (1957–1975), Wolfgang Helbich (1976–2008) and Tobias Gravenhorst (from 2008).\nThe choir has around 120 members. They perform six to eight concerts per year, also many services. Several events have been recorded or broadcast. The choir has performed in the US and Israel, and several times in France, Italy and Eastern Europe.\n\n\n== External links ==\nLiterature by and about Bremer Domchor in the German National Library catalogue\nBremer Domchor stpetridom.de\nGötz Ruempler: Die Geschichte des Bremer Domchores"

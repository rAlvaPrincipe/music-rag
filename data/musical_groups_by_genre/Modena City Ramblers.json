    "text": "Modena City Ramblers (also known as M.C.R.) is an Italian folk rock band founded in 1991. Their music is heavily influenced by Celtic themes, and can be compared to folk rock music. The band has sold over 500,000 albums. Known for their left-wing politics, their lyrics often speak out against the Mafia and fascism.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWe started as a hobby, for fun pure and simple. We had a punk vibe, we went and played without even rehearsing, sometimes we were six, sometimes seven, even eleven.\nThe Modena City Ramblers were formed in 1991 by a group of friends who wanted to play traditional Irish music. The first to join were Alberto Morselli, Giovanni Rubbiani and Alberto Cottica (previously in Lontano da dove), Chris Dennis (formerly a member of Nomadi), Filippo Chieli, Franco D'Aniello and Luciano Gaetani from 'Abazia dei folli. On Saint Patrick's Day in 1991, during a concert in a pub in Modena, they chose the name Modena City Ramblers. The name was a homage to Dublin City Ramblers, an Irish band.\nIn 1992, they were joined by bassist Massimo Ghiacci (formerly in the band Plutonium 99). During the evening of 1 March, they recorded their first demo. During a concert at a pub in Carpi, Stefano \"Cisco\" Bellotti sang \"The Wild Rover\" for the first time. At this time the Modena City Ramblers became an open company, and have remained so during throughout their history, with almost all members who have left the band returning sporadically to play with the group. Their most famous concert was performed as the opening act for the Pogues in Modena. Their repertoire has since expanded considerably, including traditional Italian songs such as \"Bella ciao\", \"Fischia il vento\", and \"Contessa\".\nThe singer of the group Cisco along with producer Kaba Cavazzuti who also became \"a new member of the Modena City Ramblers after changes in the original line-up\", released the album of the ‘brother band’ Casa del Vento, titled \"900\" which came out in February 2001.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe band's lineup has changed many times since their formation. After the first album, singer Alberto Morselli left the band; in 1996 Francesco Moneti replaced Marco Michelini, and Giovanni Rubbiani and Alberto Cottica left the band in 2001. Singer Stefano \"Cisco\" Bellotti left the band in 2005 after fourteen years.

    "text": "The Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers were an Americana group formed by songwriter Mark Olson and his wife, Victoria Williams, after Olson left his previous band, the Jayhawks. The group has also been called The Rolling Creekdippers as well as just The Creekdippers.\nFor their first three albums, the band consisted mostly of Olson, Williams and multi-instrumentalist Mike \"Razz\" Russell, with drummers Don Heffington and John Convertino. These were all recorded at the couple's home in Joshua Tree, California, and were distributed by mail order, with little touring to support them.\nIn 2000, the group picked up touring multi-instrumentalists Joshua Grange and David Wolfenberger as well as long-time Creekdipper \"Razz\" Russell, dropped \"Original Harmony Ridge\" from the name and began a two-continent touring schedule in support of three full band recordings: My Own Jo Ellen, December's Child and Mystic Theatre, which featured the touring quintet along with Greg Leisz, Danny Frankel, Don Heffington, and Jon Birdsong. December's Child included a duet by Olson and former Jayhawks bandmate Gary Louris.\nOlson and the Creekdippers have toured in several different combinations without Williams, Grange and Wolfenberger but with drummer Ray Woods and Russell. In 2004 Olson and Louris reunited for a tour with Woods and Russell.\nThe Creekdippers issued their final recording in 2004.  Olson and Williams divorced in 2006 which also led to the dissolution of their musical partnership.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Original Harmony Ridge Creek Dippers (1997)\nPacific Coast Rambler (1998)\nZola and the Tulip Tree (1999)\nMy Own Jo Ellen (2000)\nDecember's Child (2002)\nMystic Theatre (2004)\nPolitical Manifest (2004)\n\n\n=== Other contributions ===\n\"In My Hour of Darkness\" on Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons (1999)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOriginal Harmony Ridge Creekdippers at AllMusic"

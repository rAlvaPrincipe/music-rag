The band formed in early 1993; Ward and Sackler had previously been in Harrisburg-based band 23 Skidoo, with Dave Sheaffer and Joe Pisapia. Pisapia went on to form Nashville-based Joe, Marc's Brother. Ward and Sackler made some lo-fi recordings that were released on Planet Earthy in 1993; guitarist Michael Giblin signed on for the follow-up, 1999's At Home With Cherry Twister. At Home With Cherry Twister gained an entry in the Top 200 powerpop lists of 1999.\nSteve Ward moved to a solo career, recording several CDs. Mike Giblin moved on to Parallax Project and released three CDs titled Oblivious, Perpetual Limbo and I Hate Girls. He then went on to form The Split Squad, with Clem Burke of Blondie, Josh Kantor of The Baseball Project, Eddie Munoz of The Plimsouls and Keith Steng of The Fleshtones. Ross Sackler joined up with Dave Aufiero and John Fritchey from The Polins and Mike Pasariello from Wayne Supergenius to form Peabody and released a self-titled CD.\nIn 2011, Cherry Twister reunited on stage for the first time in 13 years  to perform to a sold-out crowd at the 2nd Annual Susan Giblin Foundation For Animal Wellness and Welfare Benefit.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Cherry Twister ===\nFirst album, 1993, self-titled.\n\nTrack listing\n\n\"You'd Rather See Me Lonely\"\n\"Fond\"\n\"Rose Garden\"\n\"Angeline\"\n\"Catch Me\"\n\"Mrs. Hall\"\n\"My Love\"\n\"Neverai\"\n\"We Float About\"\n\"This Man\"\n\"I'd Like To Fall In Love\"\n\"Sailing\"\n\n\n=== At Home With Cherry Twister ===\n\nTrack listing\n\n\"Don't Forget Your Man\"\n\"Sparkle\"\n\"Meteorite\"\n\"Charlotte B.\"\n\"I'm Gonna Be The Lonely Boy Tonite\"\n\"American Nightlife\"\n\"Leila\"\n\"She's Gone\"\n\"Maryann\"\n\"Black Summer\"\n\"Brighten Up\"\n\"Kinda Like A Star\"\n\"She's In Love Again\"\n\"Til I'm Blue\"\n\"Careful (Can't Fall Again)\"\n\"Why Won't You Believe In Me?\"\n\n\n== Compilation albums ==\nCome and Get It: A Tribute to Badfinger\nYellow Pills, Vol. 3\nBucketfull of Brains 50th Anniversary CD\nComing up!

    "text": "The Constellation Brands-Marvin Sands Performing Arts Center (CMAC), originally the Finger Lakes Performing Arts Center (FLPAC), is an outdoor concert venue in the Town of Hopewell, New York, just east of the City of Canandaigua, on the grounds of Finger Lakes Community College.\nThe amphitheater opened in 1983, with a mix of seating under the open air roof and on the hillside lawn looking down into the facility. It is the summer home of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and is managed by ASM Global (the same firm that formerly managed the Blue Cross Arena in Rochester, New York).\nBetween the 2005 and 2006 seasons the amphitheater was rebuilt at a cost of about $13 million, to add 54 elevated luxury booths (seating capacity of 4 per booth), expand the general seating under the amphitheater roof from 2,600 to 5,000, and install new state of the art house lighting and sound systems.\nThe center is named after Constellation Brands, a total beverage alcohol company, and Marvin Sands, founder of the Canandaigua Brands winery. Marvin founded CMAC because he realized the important role that arts and culture play in the quality of the community. In recent years, CMAC has attracted sold-out shows and musical performers such as: Dave Matthews, Kenny Chesney, Sugarland, Lady Antebellum, Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr,  Mumford & Sons, Kid Rock, Snoop Dogg, The Allman Brothers, Luke Bryan, Hans Zimmer and Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n== Board of directors ==\nBoard of Directors\n\nPresident and Executive Director – Virginia (Ginny) A.

    "text": "Ole Olsen (4 July 1850 – 4 November 1927) was a Norwegian organist, composer, conductor and military musician.\n\n\n== Life ==\nOlsen was born in Hammerfest, in the county of Finnmark. His mother died when he was young. His father was Iver Olsen, a craftsman and an amateur musician who played the organ at the local church.  From a young age Olsen learnt to play the piano and the violin. At the age of five he composed his first small piece, and by the age of seven he sometimes stood in for his father playing the church pipe organ.\nIn 1865 Olsen went to Trondheim as apprentice to a craftsman. He also studied composition and the organ from Fredrick and Just Lindeman, and sometimes substituted for Just as the organist in the Trondheim cathedral. In 1870, having given up his apprenticeship, he moved to Leipzig where he studied under Oscar Paul at the music conservatory until 1874.  There he wrote his Symphony in G major, and began his opera Stig Hvide.\nIn 1874 he became a teacher in Christiania (now Oslo), where he spent most of the rest of his life.  He conducted the Christiania Artisans' Choral Society from 1876–1880, the Music Society orchestra from 1877–1880, and the freemason's orchestra from 1894–1908.  From 1884 he was the music director of the Akershus 2nd Brigade.  From 1899–1920 he was a music inspector.\nHe had married Marie Hals, the daughter of piano manufacturer Karl Hals, in 1879. He died in Oslo on November 4, 1927. His interment was at Cemetery of Our Saviour.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nOlsen's operas were influenced by Richard Wagner. Another strong influence was the traditional Joik form of song, as he was involved in collecting folk tunes while in the military. These influenced the large number of military marches he composed, and the nationalist tradition was also represented in his stage works.\nHis compositions include:\n\noperas\nStig Hvide (1872–76)\nLajla (1893)\nStallo (1902)\nKlippeøerne (1904–10)\noratorio\nNidaros (1897)\ncantatas\nLudvig Holberg (1884)\nGriffenfeldt (1897)\nBroderbud (n.d.)\nmale chorus\nFanevakt (n.d.)\nI jotunheimen (n.d.)\nsymphonic poems\nAsgårdsreien (1878)\nAlfedans\norchestral\nSymphony in G major\nPetite Suite for piano and strings (1902)\nTrombone Concerto (1905)\nVæringetog\nRitornell\nRomance\nTarantelle\nothers\nSvein Uræd (1890)\nKing Erik XIV (1882)\npiano pieces\nmilitary marches\n\n\n== Recordings ==\n(rel. 1991) Ole Olsen: Little Suite for piano & string orchestra; Piano works by 7 women composers — Jorunn Marie Bratlie (piano), Norwegian Radio Orchestra, Christian Eggen (cond.) — Norsk Kulturråds Klassikerserie NKFCD 50024-2\n(rel. 2003) A Norwegian Rendezvous, Vol. 2: Music from the Romantic Period [includes Olsen's Suite for strings, Op.60; Miniature Suite, Op.68; Two anglaises; Vals lento] — Kristiansand Chamber Orchestra, Jan Stigmer (leader) — Intim Musik 81\n(rec. 2009) Ole Olsen: Asgaardsreien, Op.10; Symphony in G major, Op.5; Suite for string orchestra, Op.60 — Latvian National Symphony Orchestra, Terje Mikkelsen (cond.) — Sterling CDS 1086-2\n(rel. 2007) Shadow Songs [includes Olsen's Humoreske (No.2 of 3 Lieder); Paa Fjeldet, Op.7 No.1; Irmelin Rose, Op.56] — Harald Bjørkøy (tenor), ?

    "text": "SixTones (ストーンズ, Sutōnzu, stylized as SixTONES and pronounced \"Stones\") is a Japanese idol boy band formed by Smile-Up (formerly known as Johnny & Associates) in 2015. The group was previously a sub-unit of Johnny & Associates' pre-debut trainee group Johnny's Jr. SixTones made their official debut on January 22, 2020. They sold 6.24 million physical copies in Japan.\n\n\n== Name ==\nJohnny Kitagawa, the late leader of Johnny & Associates had named the group \"SixTones\"; the name was initially named \"Six Tones\" but later changed to \"SixTones\" and pronounced \"Stones\", with the \"ix\" in \"Six\" being silent. The \"stones\" pronunciation refers to \"diamond in the rough\", where the group's potential emerges as its members continually polish and refine their skills. The name also refers to the six members, each with a distinctive tone, personality and sound.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2011–2015: Pre-group formation ===\nIn 2011, shortly after the debut of Sexy Zone, the members performed as back dancers for A.B.C-Z and Hey! Say! JUMP. In February 2012, the group was selected to star in a Nippon TV drama while they were back dancing in A.B.C-Z's ABC Za (Stars) stage play. The drama, Shiritsu Bakaleya Koukou (lit. \"Private Bakaleya High School\"), was the first drama collaboration between Johnny's talents and AKB48's members. Although the drama was screened in a late-night time slot, it received a high average rating for the time slot of 2.8%, and so pursuing a movie sequel was decided upon. Members of the original cast reprised their roles in the sequel and the movie Shiritsu Bakaleya Koukou: The Movie (2012) was released in the Japanese box office in October 2012.  At this point, the six members were not officially formed as a unit. Fans of the six members addressed them as Bakareya6 or Bakareya-gumi unofficially during the airing of the drama.\nIn the same period, the six members had a direct discussion with Johnny Kitagawa, which led to announcement of the Johnny's Jr. Johnny's Dome theater: Summary shows. At the year-end's Fresh Johnny's Jr. in Yokohama Arena concert, clips of the Shiritsu Bakaleya Koukou drama were shown together with the original soundtrack Shake It Up by Kis-my-ft2.\nIn January 2013, the six members performed a cover of SIX SENSES by KAT-TUN on The Shounen Club. This was the members' last performance together before \"disbandment\" of the unofficial Bakareya6 unit. In the following month, the group was split into a 2:4 formation, with Jesse and Hokuto Matsumura performing as a duo and the four members appearing in separate performances on The Shounen Club. Additionally, the previously announced six-member performance at the Live House Johnny's Ginza was changed and the members split into the same 2:4 formation. Afterward, the members were rarely seen together as six on shows or in magazine appearances.\nIn August 2014, five of the members, excluding Jesse, performed at the \"Johnny's Ginza 2014\" shows .   Around the same period, the six members performed Shake It Up by Kis-my-ft2 together at \"Gamushara J's party‼ vol.4\". This was their first performance as six after eighteen months. In a magazine interview afterward, however, Hokuto Matsumura and Taiga Kyomoto talked about the complicated feelings they had during the show. Both felt that the show was a closure to their Bakareya episode.\nHowever, Gamushara J's party!! Vol. 6 was announced in the following month. The members consisted of Genki Iwahashi, Yuta Jinguji, and Yuta Kishi as well as the six members. Magazine reports of the shows were later published with mentioning of the \"Bakareya-Gumi\"  and interviews of the six members  for the first time in a long while.\nYears later, when SixTones talked about their group formation, they revealed that many of the members were planning to quit their agency at that point. Shintaro Morimoto was planning to return to his studies to obtain a teaching license after graduating from high school. Yugo Kochi, Taiga Kyomoto and Juri Tanaka were considering their futures, too. SixTones also revealed that during the that stagnant period, the members were brought back together by Jesse, who had expressed the desire to work together as six once again.\n\n\n=== 2015: Formation of official unit, SixTones ===\nIn The Shounen Club episode broadcast in January 2015, the six members together performed a cover of Hell No by KAT-TUN. This was the first performance together as six on the show after a two-year gap.\nIn April 2015, five of the members, excluding Taiga Kyomoto, performed in the Johnny's Ginza 2015 shows. Taiga Kyomoto was in the Elizabeth musical at that time and could not join the show.  In order to announce their group name as Six, Taiga Kyomoto rushed over from the Imperial Theatre to the Theatre Creation on 1 May 2015, where the Six members announced their formation as SixTones.\nThe group name was later changed to SixTones and read as Stones and officially announced in Shounen Club on June 10, 2015. In September 2015, SixTones starred as the main casts in the Boys: Dream of The World...Children Who Don't Know War musical for the first time, together with Snow Man. They performed their first two original songs, Kono Hoshi No HIKARI and BE CRAZY, in the Shounentachi musical.\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\nSixTones held concerts as part of Johnny's Ginza 2016 from May 27 to 30, 2016.

The music video was produced by Hideaki Takizawa while the costuming and styling were provided by the woman's fashion magazine, CanCam.

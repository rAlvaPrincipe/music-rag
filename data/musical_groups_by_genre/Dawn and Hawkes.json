The Austin American-Statesman called The Other Side “10 new tracks of sweet folk-rock — instantly appealing tunes — rooted in the singer songwriter heyday of the early 1970’s, they also fit well into the modern-day indie-folk revival.”\nThe Other Side charted in the top ten folk albums and top 100 on Americana Music Association's radio chart.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Filmography ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

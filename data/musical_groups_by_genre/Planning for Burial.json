    "text": "Planning for Burial is the musical project of American musician and singer-songwriter Thom Wasluck. Based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Wasluck started to perform as \"Burial\" in 2005 and released the debut album, Leaving in 2009. Wasluck plays all instruments during both his home recordings and live performances.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore performing as Planning for Burial, Wasluck played in local bands and recorded music with his 4 track recorder. In 2009, he released his debut album, Leaving, which was re-released by Enemies List Home Recordings in 2010. Following the re-release of the album, Wasluck recorded and released a series of tapes, EPs and splits in the following years.\nIn 2014, Planning for Burial released its second studio album, Desideratum, through The Flenser record label. In 2016, Planning for Burial released the As a Lover single through New York based record label The Native Sound. Planning for Burial has shared the stage with a wide range of music acts, including Chelsea Wolfe, Have A Nice Life and Deafheaven.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nPlanning for Burial's music takes influences from a wide array of genres, and is labeled as \"gloomgaze\" and experimental metal. According to Pitchfork critic Andy O'Connor, Thom Wasluck of Planning for Burial \"filters post-metal, doom, ambient, and goth-rock through his own terminally miserable lens.\" Vice described the band as \"a fully-contained, one-man band who delves into shoegaze, metal, black metal and other elements to craft somber, emotional songs,\" and compared its style to those of English post-metal band Jesu. New Noise Magazine argued that the act's sound \"contains elements of slowcore, shoegaze, doom, drone, '90s alt rock, '80s goth, and black metal, while never being defined by any one of those genres.\" Jason Cook of PopMatters also drew parallels between the band's debut studio album, Leaving, and Nine Inch Nails' 1999 album, The Fragile.\nWasluck releases Planning for Burial on various mediums, including on floppy disks and cassette tape.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nLeaving (2009, re-released in 2010 by Enemies List Home Recordings)\nQuietly (2013, Enemies List)\nDesideratum (2014, The Flenser)\nLive on Radio in Opposition (2014)\nA Little Less Consistent (2015)\nBelow the House (2017, The Flenser)\n22 June 2018, Mostly Quiet (2018, Glowing Window)\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\nMixtape (as How to Dress for Burial) (2013, CHVRCHDVST)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nSplit with Lonesummer (2010, Music Ruins Lives)\nLate Twenties Blues (2011)\nQuietly (2012, Tycho Magnetic Anomalies)\nAn Autumn Cassette or Leaves Will Bloom, Leaves Will Fall Long After We Are Gone (2012)\nReminder (2012)\nSplit with Dreamless (2013, Altar of Waste)\nHeaven or Atlantic City (2013, Tycho Magnetic Anomalies)\nSplit with Lonesummer (aka Split II) (2013, Music Ruins Lives)\nVile Process (Split with Troubled By Insects ) (2014, Apneic Void)\nDistances (2014, Bathetic Records)\n\"Mother Room / Planning For Burial \"To Be Everything\" 7\" Split (2015, The Native Sound)\nWith and Without (2015)\nSummer Dust Demos (2016, Glowing Window)\n\"Planning For Burial / Stress Waves 7\" Split (2016, Nostalgium Directive)\n(something) (2017)\nSplit with Drowse (2018)\n(continued) (2019)\nBasement Tapes, Volume 1 (2019)\nApril May 2010 (2020)\nSorry For Your Loss (2020)\nPFB Spring 2007 Demo (2021)\n26 November 2022 (2022)\nBLOWN OUT CASSETTE FOR JUNE 2023 (2023)\n25 November 2023 (2024)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nUntitled (2011, Music Ruins Lives)\nI Miss Our Conversations, I'm Sorry (2012, Tycho Magnetic Anomalies)\nGlowing Windows / Walk Alone (2013)\nTracks (Tall Bodies) / Sunstorm (2013)\nMischief Night (Split with Liar in Wait) (2014, Broken Limbs Recordings)\nSplit with Liar in Wait (2014)\nSplit with Mother Room (2015)\nPart Time Punks Session (2015)\nSplit with Stress Waves (2016)\nAs A Lover (2016, The Native Sound)\nWhiskey and Wine (2017)\nSomewhere In The Evening (2017)\nDull Knife Pt.

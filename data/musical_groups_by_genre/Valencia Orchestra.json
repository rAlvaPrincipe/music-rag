Founded in 1943 as the Valencia Municipal Orchestra, and a member of the Spanish Association of Symphony Orchestras (AEOS), it is not to be confused with the Orquesta de la Comunidad Valenciana, founded in 2006. The Valencia Orchestra, which first performed abroad in 1950 under José Iturbi, has toured internationally more regularly in the last 20 years. It performs mainly at the city's Palau de la Música de València, which is not to be confused with the nearby Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe Orchestra of València was established in 1943, led by Joan Lamote de Grignon.

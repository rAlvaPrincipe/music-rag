    "text": "JVG (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈjiːˌʋeːˌɡeː]; formerly known as Jare & VilleGalle) is a Finnish rap duo made up of Jare Joakim Brand (born 8 October 1987)  and Ville-Petteri Galle (born 4 October 1987).\nTheir style is often referred to as sport rap. Both Jare and Ville are passionate athletes and originally became famous for their unique and comical sports-themed songs, where they rapped about ice hockey, soccer, doping, Finnish sportspeople (such as Jari Litmanen and Teemu Selänne), snus and playing NHL video games. Some of their comedic lyrics are thought to be incomprehensible to those not from East Helsinki as much of their music adopts slang from the Eastern part of the Finnish capital. \nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, JVG held a virtual reality concert on the first of May in a simulated version of Helsinki, with estimated attendance somewhere from 700,000 to over 1,000,000.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\nFeatured in\nVilleGalle was also featured in on:\n\n2008: \"Katkerat savut\"\tby  Hulabaloo (Sirkusteltta album)\n2009: \"Siivoo suu poika\" by Juno (Kettoteippi album)\n2009: \"Raybanit\" by Juno (Kettoteippi album, also featuring ink)\n2010: \"Kuka on lämmittäny mun uunii?\"\tby Gasellit (Gasellit EP, also featuring Juno)\n2010: \"Suomileffas\" by Juno (J.K x 2 Tunti terapiaa album)\n2010: \"Hameen alle\" by Matinpoika (Vasta kohta album, also featuring Juno, Okku, Jessica & Linda)\n2010: \"Marraskuu\" by X23 (X23-12X album, also featuring Kassumato)\n2011: \"Feel Free (Remix)\" by Gracias (Gracias EP, also featuring Juno & Paperi T)\n2012: \"Hiki\" by Gasellit (Kiittämätön album)\n2012: \"Tytöt (Uusi Fantasia Remix)\" by PMMP (\"Tytöt\" single)\n2013: \"Syö mun suklaata\" by Teflon Brothers (Valkoisten dyynien ratsastajat album)\n2013: \"Täs sitä ollaa\" by Juno (050187 album, also featuring Matinpoika)\n2014: \"Flexaa\" by Cheek (single)\n2015: \"Keinutaan\" by Antti Tuisku (single)\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n== Discography: VilleGalle ==\nSingles\n\nFeatured in\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nFacebook"

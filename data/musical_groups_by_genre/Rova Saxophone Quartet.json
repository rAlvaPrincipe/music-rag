    "text": "Rova Saxophone Quartet is an American, San Francisco–based saxophone quartet, formed in October 1977. The name \"Rova\" is an acronym formed from the last initials of the founding members: Jon Raskin, Larry Ochs, Andrew Voigt, and Bruce Ackley. When Voigt left in 1988, he was replaced by Steve Adams, but the group did not change the acronym.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe quartet's music was inspired by a broad spectrum of influences, such as John Cage, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Anthony Braxton, Steve Lacy, Charles Ives, Edgard Varése, and Olivier Messiaen. Its debut album, Cinema Rovaté, was released by Metalanguage Records in 1978. Metalanguage was founded in 1978 by Henry Kaiser and Ochs. It showcased Rova as well as many independent artists and produced the Rova Arts Festival in 1980. Rova's tour of the Soviet Union in 1983 was filmed and shown on PBS. In 1985, it became a non-profit organization.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn noting Rova's role in developing the all-saxophone ensemble as \"a regular and conceptually wide-ranging unit,\" The Penguin Guide to Jazz calls its music \"a teeming cosmos of saxophone sounds\" created by \"deliberately eschewing conventional notions about swing [and] prodding at the boundaries of sound and space....\"\nJazz: The Rough Guide notes, \"Highly inventive, eclectic and willing to experiment, Rova [is] arguably the most exciting of the saxophone quartets to emerge in the format's late 1970s boom.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1978 Cinema Rovaté (Metalanguage)\n1979 The Bay (Ictus)\n1979 The Removal of Secrecy (Metalanguage)\n1979 Daredevils (Metalanguage)\n1980 This, This, This, This (Moers)\n1981 As Was (Metalanguage)\n1985 Saxophone Diplomacy (Hathut)\n1984 Favorite Street (Black Saint)\n1986 The Crowd (Hathut)\n1987 Beat Kennel (Black Saint)\n1989 The Aggregate (Sound Aspects)\n1990 Long on Logic (Sound Aspects)\n1990 Electric Rags II (New Albion)\n1991 This Time We Are Both\n1993 From the Bureau of Both (Black Saint)\n1995 The Works Vol. 1 (Black Saint)\n1996 The Works Vol. 2 (Black Saint)\n1996 John Coltrane’s Ascension (Black Saint)\n1996 Ptow!!

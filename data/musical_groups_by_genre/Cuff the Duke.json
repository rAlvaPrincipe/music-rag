    "text": "Cuff the Duke is a Canadian alt-country band from Oshawa, Ontario. They play a blend of traditional country and folk music with indie rock influences.\n\n\n== History ==\nCuff the Duke formed in Oshawa, drawing their name from a shirt purchased by front-man Wayne Petti at a secondhand shop. Starting as a duo consisting of Petti and Jeff Peers, the band later expanded to include bass player Paul Lowman and drummer Brad Fudge. In 2002 they released their first album, Life Stories for Minimum Wage on Three Gut Records. They spent the next few years touring with Hayden, acting as his backing band. In 2005 they released their second album, Cuff the Duke on Hardwood Records.\nThe line-up for Cuff the Duke has evolved, with the consistent members thus far being Wayne Petti and Paul Lowman.\nWith Dale Murray now in Cuff the Duke, the band has taken on a more polished tone, due to his pedal steel and guitar playing.  Patrick Conan (who temporarily filled in for Matt Faris who has been side-lined from playing live due to wrist surgery) has been a steady drummer and has filled Matt Faris' shoes well.  Paul Aucoin of the Hylozoists also occasionally performs live with Cuff the Duke playing vibraphone, glockenspiel and percussion.  Paul also produced Cuff the Duke's self-titled album in 2005.  Since June 2007, Corey Wood has taken on the role of Cuff the Duke's drummer, and is now an official member of the band.\nCuff the Duke utilizes a wide range of instruments, of these the more notable instruments are bells, Moog synthesizers, wind organs, Hammond organs and lap steel.\n\nOn March 16, 2007 a Cuff the Duke recording was released on The Secret Sessions, a tribute album to the Rheostatics. The band recorded a version of \"Claire\", which was originally released on  the Rheostatics' Introducing Happiness. The Secret Sessions is available from Canadian digital indie label Zunior.\nOn October 23, 2007 Cuff the Duke's album Sidelines of the City was released.\nFollowing the tour to support their 2012 album Union, the band effectively took a hiatus for several years. They returned in 2018 with a vinyl reissue of their debut album, supported by select concert dates, and announced in early 2019 that they had begun work on a new album.\nPetti and Murray have also released solo albums.\nOn April 22, 2008 Cuff the Duke performed with Greg Keelor of Blue Rodeo at a taping of the CBC Radio show Fuse at CBC's Studio 40 in Ottawa. On September 8, 2009 they released the album Way Down Here, which was produced by Keelor.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nWayne Petti – vocals, guitars, keyboards, harmonica, bass (2001–present)\nPaul Lowman – bass, fiddle, keyboards, backing vocals, mandolin, guitars, lap steel (2001–present)\nFrançois Turenne - guitars, keyboards, backing vocals (2009–present)\nAJ Johnson - drums, percussion, backing vocals (2011–present)\nThom Hammerton - keyboards (2011–present)\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nJeff Peers – guitar, keyboards, percussion (2001–2005)\nBrad Fudge – drums, percussion (2001–2003)\nSteve Krecklo – lead guitar, lap steel, keyboards, organ, percussion, backing vocals (2002, for Life Stories for Minimum Wage)\nMatt Faris – drums, percussion (2003–2006)\nDale Murray – guitar, pedal steel, backing vocals (2005–2011)\nPatrick Conan – live drums, percussion (2006)\nPaul Aucoin – live keyboards, percussion (2005–2006)\nChristopher Sandes – live keyboards (2007–2008)\nCorey Wood – drums, percussion (2006-2010)\nJordan Howard - lead guitar (live) (2012)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nLife Stories for Minimum Wage (2002 on Three Gut Records, re-released 2007 on Outside Music)\nCuff the Duke (2005 on Hardwood Records)\nSidelines of the City (2007 on Hardwood Records)\nWay Down Here (September 8, 2009 on Noble Recording Co.)\nMorning Comes (October 4, 2011 on Paper Bag Records)\nUnion (October 2, 2012 on Paper Bag Records)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nIn Our Time (April 12, 2012 on Paper Bag Records)\nIn Our Time, Part II (2013)\n\n\n=== Non-album tracks ===\n\"Deciding on Luther\" (Life Stories for Minimum Wage outtake)\n\"Words (between the lines of age)\" (Borrowed Tunes II: A Tribute to Neil Young, 2007)\n\"Claire\" (The Secret Sessions, 2007)\n\"North Window\" (Have Not Been the Same, Vol. 1: Too Cool to Live, Too Smart to Die, 2011)\n\"Star\" (Paper Bag Records vs. The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, 2012)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMusic of Canada\nCanadian rock\nList of bands from Canada\nList of Canadian musicians\nCategory:Canadian musical groups\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCuff the Duke"

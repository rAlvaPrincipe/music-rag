    "text": "The Reverend Horton Heat is the stage name of American musician James C. Heath (born 1959) as well as the name of his Dallas, Texas-based psychobilly trio. Heath is a singer, songwriter and guitarist. A Prick magazine reviewer called Heath the \"godfather of modern rockabilly and psychobilly\".\nThe group formed in 1986, playing its first gigs in Dallas' Deep Ellum neighborhood. The core members are Jim \"Reverend Horton\" Heath on guitars and lead vocals, and Jimbo Wallace on the upright bass. The band signed to Victory Records in 2012, and released its 12th studio album, Whole New Life, on November 30, 2018.\nThe band plays rock and roll with influences from 1950s country, surf, punk, big band, swing, and rockabilly standards.\n\n\n== Early career ==\n\nHeath was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, where he was raised with an appreciation of rock, electric blues and rockabilly. He was influenced by country music artists such as Junior Brown, Willie Nelson, and Merle Travis. He played in local bands until 1985 when he gained notice in Dallas as \"Reverend Horton Heat\", the moniker bestowed by the owner of  the Deep Ellum neighborhood nightclub where he played.\nAdding bassist Jimbo Wallace and drummer Taz Bentley in 1989, Reverend Horton Heat recorded for Sub Pop at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle and Crystal Clear in Dallas, which made up the majority of material on Reverend Horton Heat's debut album, Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em (1990). For their next album, the band recorded with Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers producing at Ardent Studios in Memphis: The Full-Custom Gospel Sounds of the Reverend Horton Heat (1993).\n\nInterscope Records joined with Sub Pop to co-release the band's third album Liquor in the Front (1994). Al Jourgensen of Ministry produced the album.\n\n\n== Chart success ==\nScott Churilla replaced Bentley as drummer in the mid-1990s, and the band released It's Martini Time in 1996. The album brought the band its first Billboard chart success, reaching number 165 on the Billboard 200. The band covered the boogie standard \"Rock the Joint\", and the song \"It's Martini Time\" was a minor hit. Later that year, Heath brought his street preacher style to the television series Homicide: Life on the Street, and he appeared on The Drew Carey Show in 1997.\nThe 2000 album Spend a Night in the Box was released through Time Bomb Recordings, with Paul Leary producing. The style was a return to straight-ahead rockabilly songs. The album rose through CMJ's charts to peak at number 2 in May.\nThe song \"Like a Rocket\" served as the theme for the 2002 Daytona 500 autosports race. The band featured the song on their next album, Lucky 7.\nVictory Records signed Reverend Horton Heat in 2012, and Scott Churilla returned to the band as drummer, playing for the next five years. An album titled Rev was released on January 21, 2014. A YouTube video for a single on the album, \"Let Me Teach You How to Eat,\" preceded the album on November 12, 2013. Rev rose to number 111 on the Billboard 200, becoming the band's highest-charting album. The band toured as opening act for Motörhead, and recorded rock and roll songs with Motörhead's Lemmy Kilmister, though the tapes are unreleased. Reverend Horton Heat also backed a number of other artists such as Unknown Hinson, Jello Biafra and Deke Dickerson.\nIn 2017, drummer Churilla was replaced by Arjuna \"R.J.\" Contreras, formerly of the band Eleven Hundred Springs. Matt Jordan of West Virginia joined the band playing piano and organ as well as supporting vocals. They released the album Whole New Life in 2018.\nIn 2021, Heath and Wallace teamed with drummer Slim Jim Phantom (Stray Cats) to form a side project: The Jimbos.\nThe Trio will release a live album on called Live In Houston on December 22, 2023.\n\n\n== Commercial appearances ==\n\"Psychobilly Freakout\", and later \"Wiggle Stick\", were both featured in video segments on the show Beavis and Butt-Head. The song \"I Can't Surf\" was part of the soundtrack of the video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, published in 2001. “In Your Wildest Dreams” was used in the NBC drama Homicide: Life on the Street, episode “Full Moon” (season 4, episode 17, aired April 5, 1996), in which Reverend Horton Heat also appears. \"Psychobilly Freakout\" was used on a commercial for Buell American Motorcycles and a slightly altered version was featured in the game Guitar Hero II and later on Guitar Hero Smash Hits. Their song \"Baddest of the Bad\" is featured on the soundtrack to Tony Hawk's Proving Ground. The 1997 video game Redneck Rampage also includes two of their songs, \"Wiggle Stick\" and \"Nurture My Pig!\". The song \"Big Red Rocket of Love\" is featured in the video games The Sims 3, MotorStorm and Need for Speed: The Run, and a slightly altered version of the song was featured in a 1999 television commercial for the Mazda Miata. The song \"Pride of San Jacinto\" is featured on the video game Hot Wheels Turbo Racing. The song \"Let Me Teach You How to Eat\" was featured in a 2017 Subway commercial. The song \"Mad, Mad Heart\" is featured in the video game Far Cry 5.\n\n\n== Equipment ==\nHeath has a signature guitar from the Gretsch Guitar company, the 6120RHH. One of his favorite vintage guitars is a 1954 Gibson ES-175, which he rarely plays on the road since its wiring buzzes in certain venues. His favorite amplifier was the Fender Super Reverb but is now the Gretsch Executive.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nJim Heath: guitars, vocals (1985–present)\nJimbo Wallace: upright bass (1989–present)\nJonathan Jeter: drums (2020–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\n\"Swingin'\" Jack Barton: upright bass (1985–1989)\nBobby Baranowski: drums (1985–1989)\nKyle Thomas: drums (1989)\nPatrick \"Taz\" Bentley: drums (1989–1994)\nTim Alexander: piano/keyboards (1996– Jun. 2017)\nPaul Simmons: drums (2006–2012)\nScott Churilla: drums (1995–2006, 2012–2017)\nMatt Jordan: piano (Sep. 2017– Feb. 2019)\nArjuna “RJ” Contreras: drums (2017-2020)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Collections ===\nHoly Roller: 24 Hits (Sub Pop, 1999)\n20th Century Masters – The Millennium Collection: The Best of The Reverend Horton Heat (Interscope, 2006)\n25 To Life [live] (Yep Roc, 2012)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Big Little Baby\" (1988)\n\"Psychobilly Freakout\" (1990)\n\"400 Bucks / Caliénte\" (split with The Supersuckers) (1994)\n\"One Time for Me\" (1994) No. 40 Alternative songs\n\"Lie Detector\" (1998)\n\"King\" (1999)\n\"It Was a Very Good Year\" (2000)\n\"Let Me Teach You How to Eat\" (2013)\n\"It's a Rave Up!/Beer, Write This Song\" (2015)\n\"Hardscrabble Woman/Lying to Myself\" (2016)\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\nLive and In Color (2003)\nReverend Horton Heat: Revival (2004)\n\n\n=== Soundtracks ===\nFilm\nLove and a .45 – \"The Devil's Chasing Me\" (1994)\nAce Ventura: When Nature Calls – \"Watusi Rodeo\" (1995)\nBio-Dome – \"Psychobilly Freakout\" (1996)\nFree Willy 3: The Rescue – \"Big Sky\" (1997)\nMajor League: Back to the Minors – \"Baby I'm Drunk\" (1998)\nThe Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas – \"Rock the Joint\" (2000)\nAuto Focus – \"Real Gone Lover\" (2002)\nTelevision\nHomicide: Life on the Street (episode #4.17 \"Full Moon\") – \"In Your Wildest Dreams\" (1996)\nCleveland Rocks!

    "text": "The Boston Pops is an American orchestra based in Boston, Massachusetts, specializing in light classical and popular music. The orchestra's current music director is Keith Lockhart.\nFounded in 1885 as an offshoot of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO), the Boston Pops primarily consists of musicians from the BSO, although generally not all of the first-chair players. The orchestra performs a spring season of popular music and a holiday program in December. For the Pops, the seating on the floor of Symphony Hall is reconfigured from auditorium seating to banquet and cafe seating. The Pops also plays an annual concert at the Hatch Memorial Shell on the Esplanade every Fourth of July. Their performances of Tchaikovsky's \"1812 Overture\" and Sousa's \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" are famous for howitzer cannons firing and fireworks exploding during the former and the unfurling of the American flag that occurs near the end of the latter. Identified with its longtime director Arthur Fiedler, the orchestra has recorded extensively, made frequent tours, and appeared often on television.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1881, Henry Lee Higginson, the founder of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, wrote of his wish to present in Boston \"concerts of a lighter kind of music\". The Boston Pops Orchestra was founded to present this kind of music to the public, with the first concert performed on July 11, 1885, under the leadership of Adolf Neuendorff. Called the \"Promenade Concerts\" until 1900, these performances combined light classical music, tunes from the current hits of the musical theater, and an occasional novelty number. Allowing for some changes of taste over the course of a century, the early programs were remarkably similar to the Boston Pops programs of today.\nThe Boston Pops had seventeen conductors before 1930, when Arthur Fiedler began a fifty-year tenure as the first American-born conductor to lead the orchestra. Under Fiedler's direction, the orchestra's popularity spread far beyond Boston through recordings, radio and television. Unhappy with the reputation of classical music as being solely for affluent concertgoers, Fiedler made efforts to bring classical music to a wider audience. He instituted a series of free concerts at the Hatch Shell on the Esplanade, a public park beside the Charles River. Fiedler insisted that the Pops Orchestra play popular music as well as well-known classical pieces, opening up a new niche of popular symphonic music. Of the many musical pieces created for the orchestra, the Pops' most identifiable works were the colorful novelty numbers composed by Fiedler's close friend Leroy Anderson, including \"Sleigh Ride\", \"The Typewriter\", \"The Syncopated Clock\" and several others. Fiedler also initiated the annual Holiday Pops concerts in December.\nUnder Fiedler's direction, the Boston Pops has sold more commercial recordings than any other orchestra in the world, with total sales of albums, singles, tapes, and cassettes exceeding $50 million.  The orchestra's first recordings were made in July 1935 for RCA Victor, including the first complete recording of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. The Pops made their first high-fidelity recording on June 20, 1947, of Gaîté Parisienne (based on the music of Jacques Offenbach), and recorded the same music seven years later in stereophonic sound, their first venture in multitrack recording.\nFiedler is also credited with having begun the annual tradition of the Fourth of July Pops concert and fireworks display on the Esplanade, one of the best-attended Independence Day celebrations in the country with estimated crowds of 200,000–500,000 people. Also during Fiedler's tenure, the Pops and local public television station WGBH developed a series of weekly televised broadcasts, Evening at Pops, recorded during the Pops' regular season in Symphony Hall.\nSome shows have holiday–oriented themes, such as Christmas shows featuring performers such as Jonathan Meath, who appeared as Santa with the Boston Pops for ten shows during 2008–2009.\n\nAfter Fiedler's death in 1979, he was succeeded as conductor of the Boston Pops by the noted film composer John Williams. Williams continued the Pops' tradition of bringing classical music to a wide audience, initiating the annual \"Pops-on-the-Heights\" concerts at Boston College and adding his own library of well-known film scores (including Star Wars and Indiana Jones) to the orchestra's repertoire. During his time with the Pops, Williams  performed with Sammy Davis Jr. as one of the artists for one of the Evening at Pops specials that aired in 1988. In 1991, the orchestra played Bill Monroe's Uncle Pen and other bluegrass classics with Ricky Skaggs and the Kentucky Thunder.\nIn 1992, Williams conducted a memorable performance of the Pops featuring Broadway Icon John Raitt and his daughter Grammy winner Bonnie Raitt along with members of her Band. \nKeith Lockhart assumed the post of principal Pops conductor in 1995. Lockhart continues to conduct the Boston Pops today.  Williams is Laureate Conductor of the Pops and conducts the Pops at Symphony Hall and Tanglewood.\n\n\n== Guest artists ==\nLockhart has brought in numerous pop-music acts and icons in addition to Broadway greats (the likes of Idina Menzel, Kristin Chenoweth and Sutton Foster performed with the orchestra throughout Lockhart's first 25 years there) to play with the orchestra since being named conductor, including Ben Folds, Rockapella, Guster, My Morning Jacket, Aimee Mann, Kelly Clarkson, and Elvis Costello.\n\n\n=== Spring Season ===\n\n\n==== 2012 ====\nGlee star Matthew Morrison performed with the orchestra.\n\n\n==== 2014: \"The Very Best of The Boston Pops\" (May 7–June 14, 2014) ====\nThe 2014 Spring Season was announced towards the end of February 2014, with the title \"The Very Best of the Boston Pops\".\nOpening Night was Wednesday, May 7 at 8 pm, and the orchestra opened with \"The Very Best of the Boston Pops with Jason Alexander\", conducted by Keith Lockhart.\n\"The Very Best of the Boston Pops\" was conducted by Lockhart and performed on select nights throughout the season, giving audiences both a chance to see what the orchestra was capable of performing (given the various selections from their vast library of compositions) as well as the opportunity to select which dates worked best for them.

Mugar approached legendary Pops conductor Arthur Fiedler about adding cannons and fireworks during the performance of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's famous \"1812 Overture\" as well as fireworks and confetti to end John Philip Sousa's march \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\". It was a success, and they repeated it in 1975 and 1976, when it was made nationally famous, and even earned a spot in the 1976 Guinness World Records for having the largest audience for a classical concert since the book's founding in 1955. It's grown since the Bicentennial, and has earned a place in local traditions ever since.\nThe program was broadcast on WRCB (99.5 FM Boston) on the radio from 1974 to 2016, and Bloomberg Radio from 2017 to present-day (2022), and was presented on television nationally (as \"Pops Goes The Fourth\") from 1993, 1995-2002 on A&E Network, 2002-2016 on CBS, and 2017-present-day (2022) on Bloomberg; locally from 1984 and 1987 on WGBH-TV; 1988 as part of the Evening at Pops series on PBS; 1993-2001 on WCVB-TV Channel 5; 2002-2016 on WBZ-TV (Channel 4); 2017-present-day (2022) on WHDH (TV) (Channel 7) in Boston and the greater-Boston metro area.\nFor the 2002 Fireworks Spectacular, the orchestra performed with Maureen McGovern, who paid tribute to the centennial of legendary and iconic Broadway composer Richard Rodgers by performing \"My Favorite Things\" (from The Sound of Music), and Barry Manilow, who paid tribute to and acknowledged the September 11 attacks when performing his 1976 hit \"Weekend in New England.\"\nFor the 2005 Fireworks Spectacular, the orchestra performed with Big and Rich (who performed their hit \"Love Train\"), Gretchen Wilson, and Cowboy Troy (who performed with Big and Rich for a new rendition of the Declaration of Independence), and highlighted their newest CD America by performing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", \"Armed Forces Salute\", \"This Is My Country\", \"The Gettysburg Address\" (narrated by then-WBZ-TV news anchor Jack Williams), \"Doodletown Fifers\" (performed with the Middlesex County Volunteers Fifes & Drums), \"God Bless America\", \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\", the \"Main Title\" (from Revenge of the Sith), Tchaikovsky's famous \"1812 Overture\", and Sousa's classic march, \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\".\nFor the 2006 Fireworks Spectacular, the orchestra performed with  Aerosmith, who performed \"Dream On\" and \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\".

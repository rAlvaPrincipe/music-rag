    "text": "Peccatum was an avant-garde metal band from Norway. Their influences range from black metal, progressive metal, industrial music, symphonic metal and gothic metal to European classical music and contemporary music.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeccatum was formed by singer Ihriel (Heidi Solberg Tveitan), her husband Ihsahn (of the well-known black metal band Emperor), and her brother Lord PZ. The group released three albums and two EPs. Lost in Reverie, released in 2004 after Lord PZ's departure, moved towards a more classical, avant-garde and musically opaque direction.\nLost in Reverie and the 2005 EP The Moribund People were both produced under the label Mnemosyne Productions, owned and operated by Ihriel and Ihsahn themselves.\nOn March 4, 2006 Peccatum split, leaving room for Ihriel to continue with Starofash and Ihsahn to work on his solo project.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio releases ===\nStrangling from Within – (1999)\nOh, My Regrets (EP) – (2000)\nAmor Fati – (2000)\nLost in Reverie – (2004)\nThe Moribund People (EP) – (2005)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Peccatum\" on Encyclopedia Metallum\n\n\n== External links ==\nMnemosyne Productions"

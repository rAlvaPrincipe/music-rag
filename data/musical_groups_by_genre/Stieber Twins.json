They are known as graffiti artists, breakdancers, rappers, hip hop producers and DJs.\nThe twins have been active since about 1983, and the two have been producing hip hop music since 1992. Their first instrumental was on the album Alte Schule (\"Old school\"), the first songs which featured the twins rapping were \"HipHop und Rap\" (\"HipHop and Rap\") and \"Allein zu zweit\" (\"Alone Together\") and were released in 1995 on the album The Sound of MZEE. They are considered to be pioneers of the German hip hop scene and their productions were well ahead of their time, they have had a formative influence on the Hip Hop and Rap genres.\nAlthough they have only released one rap album, they are well respected in Germany because of their lyrics, which are critical of the hip hop business and politics, all of which are performed in the distinctive accent of the Heidelberg, Germany area.\nThey have worked with many German artists and have also collaborated with artists outside of Germany such as GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, Prodigal Sunn of Sunz of Man and the Arsonists.\nIn 2006, the twins performed at the Hip Hop Kemp Festival in the Czech Republic.\nToday, they are active as DJs and play all over Germany and especially in their hometown of Heidelberg.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nFenster zum Hof (Album, 1997, MZEE) engl. \"Rear Window\"\n\"Just Writin' My Name\" (feat.

    "text": "Cartel de Santa is a Mexican hip hop group from Santa Catarina, Nuevo León, Mexico, founded by Hector Montaño and Ronaldo Sifuentes. The band started playing in 1996 as part of the Avanzada Regia musical movement and Artilleria Pesada. Currently composed by Eduardo Davalos de Luna, also known as MC Babo or Babo (lead vocals), Rowan Rabia (beatmaker) and DJ Agustín (only in live shows). They have been referred to as one of the most notable Mexican hip-hop groups.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1996–2003: Beginnings and self-titled debut album ===\nCartel de Santa started playing in 1996, when MC Babo and some friends began singing improvised rap songs.\nThe group became famous in 2003, when the band released their debut self-titled album. The album includes hits such as \"Perros\", \"Todas Mueren por Mí\" and \"La Pelotona\". The album was produced by Jason Roberts who had previously worked with artists such as Cypress Hill, Ice Cube, House of Pain, Guns N' Roses, Control Machete, and Plastilina Mosh. This contributed to the fame of the band.\nThat same year, the group released a video clip of the song \"Perros\". This video was broadcast across Latin America on MTV.\n\n\n=== 2004–2007: Vol. II and Volumen ProIIIbido ===\nA year later, in 2004, a new album was released, Vol. 2, which included hits as \"Blah, blah, blah\", \"La Llamada\" and \"El Arte del Engaño\". Cartel de Santa Vol. 2 counted with the collaboration of other artists, such as Tego Calderón, in \"Conexión Puerto Rico\", and Mr. Pomel, in \"Crónica Babilonia\".\nIn 2007, Cartel de Santa recorded its third album, named Volumen ProIIIbido. It included the single \"Cheka Wey\" featuring female hip-hop artist Mery Dee. A few months after the album release, the lead vocalist, Babo, was arrested for the killing of a fellow band member. During a confrontation with Juan Miguel Chávez, an old rival, on the street, Babo shot a warning shot, which instead hit former band member Ulises. Eduardo Dávalos, Babo, turned himself in to the Ministerial Police of Nuevo Leon state. He later wrote a song about the incident while in prison in which he expresses his regret over the killing of Ulises. The band released a compilation album, Cartel de Santa, Greatest Hits, aimed at raising funds to be used to set the vocalist free. MC Babo was liberated from prison nine months later, with help of Sony Music, after the group paid about 130,000 pesos as bail.\n\n\n=== 2008–2013: Vol. IV and Sincopa ===\nIn February 2008, the band released its fourth album, Vol. IV. Some of the songs recount Babo's memories during the months he was in prison. The album was meant as a message to fans that \"el Cartel\" would keep making music. The first single of this album was \"Hay mamita\" which also has a music videoclip.\nIn March 2010, Babo announced on the band's Myspace the release of another album. The fifth album was released in May 2010 with the name Vol. V: Sincopa. Like their last work, Volume V showed a better sound and beats quality. Cartel de Santa was nominated for the Latin Grammys as a result of their new release.\n\n\n=== 2014–present: Golpe Avisa and Viejo Marihuano ===\n\nThe group's sixth album, Golpe Avisa was released on August 5, 2014, by Sony Music Entertainment. This work is the group's first studio album released after the departure of rapper MC Dharius. The album features collaborations with Campa, Da Fucking Draw, Big Man and Millonario. The song \"Me alegro de su odio\" had originally been released with vocal work from then group member Dharius in June 2013. However, after the rapper's decision to leave the group, this subject had to be re-recorded to include it in the album. This reissued theme was never released as a single.\nOn 3 October 2016, Cartel de Santa released their seventh album Viejo Marihuano, with the singles \"Mucha Marihuana\" and \"Soy Quien soy\". It was published by Babilonia Music, S.A. De C.V. In 2017, the group received a gold record in Mexico for reaching 100,000 sales of the album.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn April 2007, MC Babo turned himself in to Mexican police officials claiming that he accidentally shot and killed his fellow group member. While at a house in Santa Catarina, Nuevo León, MC Babo learned that a formal rival was headed to the home to settle a dispute. He then proceeded to shoot Juan Miguel Chavez Pimentel, known as El Micky, in the leg upon his arrival. Babo claimed that one of the shots from his .38 revolver ricocheted off of the floor and hit his friend Ulises 'Buenrostro', killing him. In January 2008, Babo was released from jail after nine months incarceration, after the group paid a bail of about 130,000 pesos.\nIn May 2018, nude photographs of MC Babo were published on the internet.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nCartel de Santa, Casa Babilonia presentan: Los Mixtapes (2006)\nCartel de Santa, Greatest Hits (2007)\nCasa Babilonia Records: Compilado (2008)\nCasa Rifa: Demos (2009)\nSincopa 5.1 (2011)\n\n\n=== Soundtrack albums ===\nLos Jefes (Banda Sonora de la Película) (2015)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nMe Atizo Macizo Tour (En Vivo) (2012)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Pollo y Conejo\" (2018)\n\"Burbujas de Cristal\" (2019) (with Millonario)\n\"Vaya Vaya\" (2020)\n\"TUY\" (2021) (with Alemán, Millonario, and Adán Cruz)\n\"Piensa en Mi\" (2023)\n\"Shorty Party\" (2023) (with La Kelly)\n\"Pablito y el Pelon\" (2023) (with Pablito Calavera)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cartel de Santa at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website\nAllmusic"

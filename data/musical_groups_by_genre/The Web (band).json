    "text": "The Web were a British jazz/blues band, with a style simultaneously related to America's West Coast groove and UK's proto-prog movement. Hailing from the British psychedelic scene, their style is often described as atmospheric, moody, melancholy, and dark. \nThey were originally fronted by African-American singer John L. Watson, with whom they released two studio albums, Fully Interlocking (1968) and Theraposa Blondi (1970). The band increasingly delved into a progressive rock sound with which Watson's vocal style was incompatible, so they set Watson up with a solo career and replaced him with keyboardist/vocalist Dave Lawson. Shortening their name to simply Web, the band fully embraced their new jazz-prog sound on their third LP, I Spider (1970). Following the departure of saxophonist/flautist Tom Harris, the band changed names again, to Samurai. \nA final, self-titled album followed in 1971. With the band losing steam due to financial struggles and lack of recognition, Lawson accepted an invitation to join Greenslade.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJohn L.

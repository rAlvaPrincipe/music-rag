    "text": "The Jazz Mandolin Project was an acoustic jazz fusion group formed in Burlington, Vermont, by Jamie Masefield in 1993.\nMasefield played banjo with dixieland bands, including the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, before switching to mandolin. In 1996, the debut album consisted of Gabe Jarrett on drums and Stacey Starkweather on bass. The following year the group broke up, and Masefield kept the name with different musicians: bassist Chris Dahlgren and drummer Jon Fishman from Phish. They recorded the next album, Tour de Flux. Masefield described the band's music as \" very contrapuntal stuff, like a three-way conversation.\"\nThe Project's next album, Xenoblast was on Blue Note Records, though it was less a jazz album and more improvisational jazz rock, featuring the guitarist Trey Anastasio of Phish. \nIn 2003 they released a drum & bass-influenced album called Jungle Tango, which included Ari Hoenig and Danton Boller. In 2005 Masefield returned to a more acoustic sound with The Deep Forbidden Lake, which features cover versions of songs by Radiohead, Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen, and Django Reinhardt.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Jazz Mandolin Project (Accurate, 1996), (Lenapee, 2004)\nTour de Flux  Records (Accurate, 1999)\nXenoblast (Blue Note, 2000), (EMI Digital, 2003)\nAfter Dinner Jams  (Lenapee, 2001), (DKE, 2004)\nJungle Tango  (Lenapee, 2003)\nThe Deep Forbidden Lake (Lenapee, 2005)\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nJamie Masefield — Acoustic and electric mandolin, charango, and tenor banjo (All)\nStacey Starkweather — Electric and acoustic bass, effects, and mellotron (1996)\nChris Dahlgren — Double bass, imbera, and music box (1999, 2000)\nDanton Boller — Acoustic and electric bass (2001, 2003)\nGreg Cohen — Upright bass (2005)\nGabriel Jarrett — Drums and percussives (1996)\nJon Fishman — Drums and cuica (1999),  Piano (2001)\nAri Hoenig — Drums, piano (2000, 2001, 2003)\nGil Goldstein — Piano, accordion (2001, 2003, 2005)\nChris Lovejoy — Percussion (2001, 2003)\n\n\n== References =="

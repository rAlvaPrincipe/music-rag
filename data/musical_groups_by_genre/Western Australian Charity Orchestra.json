    "text": "Western Australian Charity Orchestra Inc (WACO) is a not-for-profit charity organisation dedicated to changing lives through music. Their current ensembles include a full symphony orchestra – the West Coast Philharmonic, the West Coast Philharmonic Chorus and the WA Wind Symphony – all based in Perth, Western Australia. All ensembles are made up almost entirely of volunteers, and for many years the WACO produced concerts to help fund-raise for Western Australian charities. In 2017 WACO Inc became an Australian Registered charity in their own right, and now their volunteers work in the community to make a difference first-hand in the lives of others.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Western Australian Charity Orchestra was founded in 2008 by Samuel Parry, a music student at WAAPA. The organisation was formed with the twin aims of raising money for deserving causes by providing musicians with opportunities to fundraise for charities, and bringing music and joy into the community. From 2008 to 2016 the organisation held eight concert seasons, and in its 2016 season WACO raised $19,000 for Guide Dogs WA.\nFrom 2008 to 2009 and 2013–2016, WACO produced an annual summer series featuring the Western Australian Charity Orchestra and Choir. In 2017 the organisation expanded into four full-time ensembles including an orchestra, wind symphony, chorale and youth concert band.\nFrom 2015 to 2016 WACO ran the North Coast Youth Concert Band (NCYCB), a concert band created for high school students mainly for players from Perth's northern suburbs.\nWACO is a not-for-profit incorporated organisation and an Australian Registered charity (2017-).\nFrom 2017 onwards, WACO Inc. took a new direction in charity work. Now, their own volunteers work in the community to make a difference first-hand in the lives of others.\nIn February 2020 the Western Australian Charity Orchestra changed its name to the West Coast Philharmonic Orchestra, whilst retaining the WACO name for the incorporated organisation itself.\nThe orchestra's home is the newly built and fully equipped Churchlands Concert Hall at Churchlands Senior High School. They also regularly perform in the Perth Concert Hall. WACO's ensembles are conducted by founder and music director Samuel Parry.\n\n\n== Ensembles ==\nWACO ensembles include the West Coast Philharmonic Orchestra, West Coast Philharmonic Chorus & WA Wind Symphony and consist of more than 200 volunteer musicians from all walks of life. WACO members include professionals, students, educators, medical and legal professionals, and retirees, united by their love for delivering outstanding musical performances.\n\n\n=== West Coast Philharmonic Orchestra ===\nThe West Coast Philharmonic Orchestra, formerly the Western Australian Charity Orchestra, is a community orchestra comprising of 50+ music-loving volunteer musicians The orchestra performs a variety of traditional, much-loved symphonic repertoire alongside contemporary, film and Australian music.\n\n\n=== West Coast Philharmonic Chorus ===\nThe West Coast Philharmonic Chorus program is held over the summer holidays, and is a wonderful opportunity to sing great choral music in a friendly and encouraging environment in spectacular venues, accompanied by the orchestra.\n\n\n=== WA Wind Symphony ===\nThe WA Wind Symphony is a community concert band founded in February 2017.

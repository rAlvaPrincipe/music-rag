    "text": "In My Rosary was a German darkwave/neofolk music project with two members, Ralf Jesek and Dirk Lakomy. Though apparently a temporary project, the band has released over a dozen albums since its formation in 1993. Their sound is reminiscent of both acoustic folk music and early gothic rock/new wave, and incorporates electronic elements in varying degrees.\nIn 2011, Ralf Jesek and Dirk Lakomy went their separate ways. Ralf now continues the style of In My Rosary in the new project I-M-R, with the same live members as before. Dirk makes a more electro style of music with friend Tobias Birkenbeil under the name Lakobeil.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Full-Length Albums ===\n1993 Those Silent Years (CD)\n1994 Under the Mask of Stone (CD)\n1995 Strange EP (CD)\n1996 Farewell to Nothing (CD)\n1997 Against the Grain (CD)\n1999 A Collection of Fading Moments (CD)\n2002 The Shades of Cats (CD)\n2004 Greetings From the Past (CD)\n2004 Your World is a Flower (CD)\n2007 15 (CD)\n2010 Retro (CD)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial In My Rosary website\nIn My Rosary at Discogs.com"

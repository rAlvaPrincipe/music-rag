    "text": "Teeth of the Sea is a British psychedelic experimental rock band. The original members of the band were Sam Barton, Mike Bourne, John Hirst, Jimmy Martin and Darren Strickland.\n\"Orphaned by the Ocean\" was the band's first release in 2009 by which point Darren Strickland had left. Subsequently John Hirst left the band and was replaced by Mat Colegate who appears on their second album \"Your Mercury\" a year later. \nIn 2011 they supported Sea Power.\nSince 2017 they have been a trio with the departure of Colegate. Later work has seen a move to more drone and ambient styles. They have performed live soundtracks at the Science Museum, London and played records and presented on BBC Radio 6 Music.\n\n\n== References =="

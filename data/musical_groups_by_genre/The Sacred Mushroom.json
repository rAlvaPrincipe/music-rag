    "text": "The Sacred Mushroom was a blues rock and psychedelic rock band from Cincinnati, Ohio, active from 1966-1969.  The band was led by guitarist and songwriter Larry Goshorn and his younger brother, vocalist Tim Goshorn. All members lived in a house in Cincinnati called \"Mushroom House\" that \"sheltered a small tribe\" to escape from \"the rich-blundering-narrow-minded-owner-of-the-non-essential-producing-factory.\"\nIn 1967, the band recorded a debut 45rpm 7\" single, \"Break Away Girl\" b/w \"Yellow Fever,\" which was released in the same year by Nashville-based Minaret Records. The single received local and regional airplay. The band was focused on guitarist, singer and songwriter Larry Goshorn and his brother, vocalist Danny. They recorded one album in 1969 which included original material and the covers of T-Bone Walker's \"Mean Old World\" and Ray Davies' \"I'm Not Like Everybody Else\".\"The Sacred Mushroom\" LP was released in 1969 by NYC label Parallax records, the 'underground' subsidiary of Audio Fidelity Records.\nThe band dissolved in 1969. Both Larry and Danny Goshorn later joined the Cincinnati band Pure Prairie League with their other brother Tim Goshorn. The brothers were active in Pure Prairie League in various forms in the 1970s and 1980s before leaving to form The Goshorn Brothers Band.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nLarry Goshorn, lead guitar, backup vocals\nDanny Goshorn, lead vocals\nJoe Stewart, bass\nFred Fogwell, rhythm guitar\nDoug Hamilton, drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Single ===\nBreak Away Girl b/w Yellow Fever (Larry Goshorn) 1967, Minaret Records MIN-131 Arranged by Ar-Jay, Produced by Finley Duncan\n\n\n=== Album ===\nThe Sacred Mushroom May 1969, Parallax Records: P-4001\nSide A:\n\n1.

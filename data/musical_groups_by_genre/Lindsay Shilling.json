He has one older sister Margaret and one younger brother Martin. Shilling began his playing career at the age of eleven in local and national youth brass bands including Chatteris Town Band where his father Roy was the conductor. In 1977 he won an Associated Board of Music scholarship to the Royal College of Music studying with John Iveson and Arthur Wilson. Since leaving college he has built up a successful and varied career, firstly freelancing with the Royal Philharmonic and the Bournemouth Orchestras. He was asked to perform regularly with the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble, now London Brass, where he continues to play. Shilling has subsequently worked with all the major London orchestras, early and contemporary music ensembles, but still manages to maintain his links with his home where he is currently the president of Chatteris Town Band; the band where he began his playing career and a band he still plays with whenever he has the opportunity.\n\n\n== References =="

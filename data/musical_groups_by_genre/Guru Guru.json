    "text": "Guru Guru is a German krautrock band formed in 1968 as The Guru Guru Groove by Mani Neumeier (drums), Uli Trepte (bass) and Eddy Naegeli (guitar), later replaced by the American Jim Kennedy. After Kennedy collapsed on stage due to a serious illness, Ax Genrich replaced him to complete the classic Guru Guru line up, in time for their debut album in 1970.\n\n\n== Music ==\nGuru Guru were related to the free jazz music scene through their work with Swiss pianist Irène Schweizer and through Neumeier, who had already won several jazz prizes. The band was also influenced by psychedelic rock artists, such as Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown, Rolling Stones and early Pink Floyd.\nAmong the band's closest musical colleagues were Amon Düül, Can and Xhol Caravan, with whom Guru Guru played jam sessions.\n\nFrontman Mani Neumeier (drummer and singer) has an original style of playing drums, and is known in the European jazz rock-scene. He was also involved in numerous other projects, including Tiere der Nacht, The Psychedelic Monsterjam, Damo Suzuki's Network, Globe Unity Orchestra, Harmonia, Acid Mothers Guru Guru, Voodootrance and Lover 303.\n\n\n== Social environment ==\nGuru Guru's live performances in the late 1960s and early 1970s were politically left-oriented. They organized concerts together with the Socialist German Student Union, read political texts between the songs, and sporadically gave concerts in prisons. Their shows were extravagant and anarchistic, some of the musicians lived together in a commune in the German Odenwald region, experimented with hallucinogens (one of their songs is titled \"The LSD March\" / German: \"Der LSD-Marsch\"). Mani Neumeier is one of the organizers of the annual Krautrock-Festival in Finkenbach, Oberzent.\n\n\n== Publicity ==\nGuru Guru has released over 40 LPs and CDs, and has sold over 500,000 records. The band has played numerous live concerts, appeared in films, radio and television. In 1976, Guru Guru was the first German band to play live on the WDR TV show Rockpalast.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1970 UFO\n1971 Hinten\n1972 Känguru\n1973 Guru Guru\n1973 Don't Call Us, We Call You\n1974 Dance of the Flames\n1974 Der Elektrolurch (2 LP)\n1975 Mani und seine Freunde\n1976 Tango Fango\n1977 Globetrotter\n1978 Live (2 LP)\n1979 Hey du\n1981 Mani in Germani\n1983 Mani Neumeiers neue Abenteuer (aka Guru Mani ... )\n1987 Jungle\n1988 Guru Guru 88\n1988 Live 72\n1992 Shake Well – MC\n1993 Shake Well\n1995 Wah Wah\n1996 Mask (limited edition)\n1997 Moshi Moshi\n1999 Live 98 (3-CD set, also on 2 LP)\n2000 2000 Gurus\n2003 Essen 1970 (live)\n2005 In the Guru Lounge\n2007 Wiesbaden 1972 (live)\n2008 PSY\n2009 Live on tour 2008\n2009 Wiesbaden 1973 (live)\n2011 Doublebind\n2011 Live in Germany '71\n2013 Electric Cats\n2014 Live at Lido\n2016 Acid Guru Pond (Split Album: Bardo Pond, Guru Guru, Acid Mothers Temple)\n2018 Rotate!\n2020 Live in China\n2023 Incredible World Of Guru Guru\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ambient music artists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website (with Mani Neumeier)\nInterview with Mani Neumeier\nGuru Guru discography at Discogs"

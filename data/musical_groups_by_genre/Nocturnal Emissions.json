    "text": "Nocturnal Emissions is Nigel Ayers's sound art project that has released numerous records and CDs in music styles ranging from electro-acoustic, musique concrète, hybridised beats, sound collage, post-industrial music, ambient and noise music.\nTheir sound art has been part of an ongoing multimedia campaign of guerrilla sign ontology utilizing video art, film, hypertext and other media, particularly collage. Nocturnal Emissions were depicted by the novelist Stewart Home.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe project was initiated in Derbyshire in the late 1970s by Nigel Ayers (b. 1957), a former art student who, during the period, lived in London, together with collaborators Danny Ayers (b. 1964) and Caroline K (1957–2008). Since 1984 Nocturnal Emissions has continued mainly as Nigel Ayers' solo project.\n\n\n== Record labels ==\nIn 1979, Nocturnal Emissions founded Sterile Records. Sterile Records’ approach was a combination of the experiments of musique concrète and Fluxus combined with the critical eye of conceptual art and the spontaneity and energy of punk rock. The dark humour of industrial music and the incomprehensible nonsense of various ultra-leftist political fractions were an essential part of the mix. Sterile Records used both commercial and non-commercial media to deliver anti-capitalist messages, multi-coloured noise and information overload. The label was effectively dissolved in 1986, when Ayers founded Earthly Delights.\nIn 1990–92, Nocturnal Emissions collaborated on Butoh dance performances in Europe and the United States, with the Japanese choreographer Poppo Shiraishi. Around this time Nocturnal Emissions' Situationist-influenced practice became increasingly informed by magick, stone circles, techno–shamanism, neo-paganism, animism and Fortean research. There were many collaborations on animated films by  Charlotte Bill (filmmaker and musician). Bill was never an official member of Nocturnal Emissions but admits to being one of the legion of members of The Fall\n\n\n== Association of Autonomous Astronauts ==\nNocturnal Emissions were later to be associated with the Kernow section of the Association of Autonomous Astronauts\n\n\n== Partial discography ==\nTissue of Lies LP (Emiss, 1981)\nTissue of Lies Revised CD (Dark Vinyl, 1990)\nFruiting Body LP(Sterile, 1981)\nDrowning in a Sea of Bliss LP (Sterile, 1983; cassette reissued by Touch, 1985;  CD reissued by Soleilmoon, 1993)\nViral Shedding LP (Illuminated, 1983)\nBefehlsnotstand LP (Sterile, 1983)\nChaos (Live at the Ritzy) LP (Cause For Concern,  1983)\nDyskinesia (Sterile, 1983)\nThe Fight Goes On cassette (Staalplaat, 1984)\nNo Sacrifice 12\" (Sterile, 1984)\nShake Those Chains Rattle Those Cages LP (Sterile, 1985)\nSongs of Love and Revolution LP (Sterile, 1985; CD re-issue from Dark Vinyl, 1992)\nThe World is my Womb LP (Earthly Delights, 1987; Soleilmoon cassette, 1989; Soleilmoon CD, 1999)\nDuty Experiment 1982–1984 LP (Earthly Delights, 1988; CD reissue Soleilmoon, 1995)\nSpiritflesh LP (Earthly Delights, 1988; Soleilmoon cassette, 1989)\nStoneface LP (Parade Amoureuse, 1989; CD reissue from Staalplaat, 1994 with Spiritflesh)\nDa Dum 7\" (Parade Amoureuse, 1989)\nInvocation of the Beast Gods CD (Staalplaat, 1989)\nBeyond Logic, Beyond Belief LP (Earthly Delights, 1989)\nMouth of Babes LP (Earthly Delights, 1990; CD reissue from Soleilmoon, 1991)\nEnergy Exchange LP (Earthly Delights, 1991)\nCathedral CD (Musica Maxima Magnetica, 1991)\nBlasphemous Rumours CD(Staalplaat, 1992)\nThe Seminal Works –12 tape box set (Earthly Delights, 1992)\nMagnetized Light CD (Musica Maxima Magnetica, 1993)\nThe Quickening LP (Earthly Delights, 1993)\nGlossalalia CD (Soleilmoon, 1994)\nHoly of Holies – 4-hour DAT (Soleilmoon, 1994)\nBinary Tribe CD (Staalplaat, 1994)\nImaginary Time LP(Soleilmoon, 1995)\nAutonomia CD (Soleilmoon, 1996)\nFriction And Dirt CD (Staalplaat, 1996)\nTharmuncrape An'goo CD (Soleilmoon, 1997)\nSunspot Activities CD (Soleilmoon, 1997)\nOmphalos CD (Soleilmoon, 1998\nFuturist Antiquarianism CD (Soleilmoon, 2000)\nCollateral Salvage CD (Soleilmoon, 2003)\nNightscapes LP (Small Voices, 2006)\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\nThe Beauty of Pollution (with C.C.C.C.)

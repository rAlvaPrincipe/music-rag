    "text": "Monosurround is a Berlin-based electronic music and live-act duo, formed in 1999. It is made up of Erik Schaeffer and Ramtin Asadolahzadeh. Since 2002, they have released EPs and albums in France, Germany, and Japan on Vitalic's record label Citizen Records. In 2010 they started their own record label called \"MS Records\" as a platform for their music and the concept behind their \"Maximalism\".\n\n\n== History ==\nRamtin Asadolahzadeh and Erik Schaeffer were introduced in Berlin in 1999. They started to work together in the same month. Their first joint project was the composition and co-production of music for the German cinema-releases Ants in the Pants (2000) and Bundle of Joy (2000).\nCombining their respective music influences, in the summer of 2001 Monossurround moved towards composing electronic music. Their first release in the same year “I warned you baby” was an immediate success, becoming the official festival anthem SonneMondSterne Festival 2002 in Saalburg, Thuringia. The track samples the American jazz singer Spanky Wilson.\nThrough the success of “I warned you baby” connections arose between Monosurround and their peers. They remixed many artists including Sono, Phil Fuldner, Da Hool, TISM Northern Lite and Glamour to Kill. They were simultaneously remixed by artists, including The Gigler, Shir Khan, The Raccoon Brothers, DJ SPUD and Malente.\nAt that time, parallel to regular live performances, Monosurround started working on their first studio album, Hello World. In 2004 the duo stopped performing live in order to concentrate their energies on the development and production of the album.\nThe EP Borschtchick was released in Germany in 2005 through Moonbootique Records owned by Moonbootica. In January 2006 the Cocked, Locked EP was released on techno DJ Vitalic's record label Citizen Records in France. This EP includes the tracks “Borschtchick” and “Cocked, Locked and Ready to Rock”.\nHaving successfully released these EPs into the French market in 2006 and 2007, Monosurround played live again alongside acts such as Vitalic and The Hacker.\nThe album Hello World was released across different countries at the end of 2008: France in September, Germany in November, and Japan in December.\n\n\n== Style ==\nThe Monosurround sound has changed greatly since its formation in 1999. Azadolahzadeh and Schaeffer come from different musical backgrounds: 1960s and 1970s soul funk, and techno and classical music respectively. Their first two years together saw performances including up to nine instrumentalists on stage playing 1960s crossover big beat.\nIn 2001 a notable change in their sound occurred. Azadolahzadeh and Schaeffer moved towards electronic music in their composition, bringing their sound closer to electronic dance music and techno.\nThe major stylistic turning point came in 2003 with the creation of their track “We”. The signature sound from this point onwards combined epic vocal/choral textures with hard industrial noises. These features of the music bear comparison to the Justice (French band) sound which arose at the same time.\nFrom this point onwards Azadolahzadeh and Schaeffer worked under the self-imposed description “maximalism”. This theme motivates their music, artwork, and philosophy behind their work.\n\n\n== Festival appearances ==\nThrough their relationship with Citizen Records, Monosurround have played alongside Vitalic and The Hacker at Les Plagess festival in France, 2006 and 2007. This tour with Vitalic continued on to Barcelona to play the Razzmatazz complex in 2007. Their last big festival appearance was Sónar festival 2008, playing alongside The Hacker.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nEarly in 2008, the bottled mineral water brand Perrier used the track “Cocked, Locked, and Ready to Rock” in a TV advertising campaign in Germany. Since early 2010 Monosurround release their music on their own label MS Records. MS Records dedicated its work to release and spread maximalistic music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n2007 Early Days (Layb - Berlin Artists)\n2008 Hello World (Citizen Records)\n2010 Hello World (MS Records)\nMaxis and EPs\n2002 I Warned You Baby (1st Decade Records)\n2002 I Warned You Baby - Remixes (Superstar Records)\n2002 I Warned You Baby (Superstar Records)\n2003 Creepy Guys EP (1st Decade Records)\n2003 Bo Bullet mini EP (1st Decade Records)\n2003 Bo Bullet EP (1st Decade Records)\n2004 We EP (1st Decade Records)\n2005 Borschtchick (Moonboutique Records)\n2006 Cocked Locked EP (Citizens Records)\n2006 Cocked, Locked, Reading to Rock (Hammarskjöld)\n2008 Cocked, Locked Ready to Rock – Summarized (Citizen Records) \n2010 Hello World [Remixed] (MS Records) \n2010 \"All Night Long\" (MS Records) \n2011 \"REworks\" (MS Records)\nRemixes\n2002 TISM - Defecate On My Face (TISM)\n2002 Neonman - Future Is Pussy (1st Decade Records)\n2003 Northern Lite - MyPain (1st Decade Records)\n2003 Sono - Heading For (Island Zeitgeist Records)\n2003 Phil Fuldner - Never Too Late (Kosmo Records)\n2004 Glamour To Kill - Shake Your Body, Baby (Pale Records)\n2005 Da Hool feat.

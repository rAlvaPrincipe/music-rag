It was formed in 1997 by emcees S-Roc (Dwayne King), Clip (Jason Balde), May One 9 (Randy Brookes) and DJ/producer Agile (Ajene Griffith). May 19 was replaced by King Reign (Kai Thomas) in 2006.\nBrassmunk independently released their first EP (variations on the singles \"One, 2\" and \"Stop, Look, Listen\") in 1999. Their title track from their second EP, Live Ordeal!, received a Juno nomination for Rap Recording of the Year. The track \"El Dorado', from their 2002 EP, also received a Juno nomination for Rap Recording of the Year. \nAlso in 2002, they released the EP Dark Sunrise. The following year, Dark Sunrise was re-released worldwide on Battleaxe Records as an LP, and included their previous independent releases. Dark Sunrise was nominated for Rap Recording of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2004. Their follow-up album, FEWturistic, was released on March 20, 2007, and featured several additional artists including Kardinal Offishall and Moka Only. In 2008, the album earned them another Juno nomination.\nThe band's best known singles are \"Big\", produced by Mr. Attic of Da Grassroots and \"Oh Supaman\", produced by Agile and based in part on samples from Laurie Anderson's 1981 single \"O Superman (For Massenet)\".\nBrassMunk has been inactive since 2008.

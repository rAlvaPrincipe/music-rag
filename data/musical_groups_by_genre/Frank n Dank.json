    "text": "Frank N Dank (real names Frank Bush and Derrick Harvey) are an American hip hop group from Detroit, Michigan. They also go by the names Frank Nitt (previously known as Frank Nitty, which is a reference to the 1930s crime boss Frank Nitti) and Dankery Harv, and are best known for their many collaborations with the late J Dilla.  Known for their party-driven, tongue-in-cheek raps, the duo first came to public attention as guests on producer J Dilla's album, Welcome 2 Detroit in 2001. Prior to this, they had been performing in their hometown, Detroit, since the mid-1990s and had released the 12\"s \"Everybody Get Up!\" and \"Me and My Man\" between \"Love (A Thing of the Past)\", both produced by J Dilla.\nThe group signed a recording deal with MCA Records, but their 2003 album, 48 Hours, was at first rejected by the label, reworked with new production and resubmitted by the group, and finally shelved by the label altogether. Bootlegs of the reworked version eventually surfaced on the underground. The album was entirely produced by J Dilla, who uses very few samples throughout the album, instead choosing to concoct synth-driven beats for the MCs to rhyme over.  It is believed that the original version of 48 Hours was more sample based, and that this may have been a factor in it being rejected by MCA, due to sample clearances.\nFrank n Dank released their follow-up albums, Xtended Play in 2004, and Xtended Play Version 3.13 in 2006. The album Xtended Play Version 3.13 contained production by J Dilla (who died before its release), and other producers. The song \"MCA\" details their uphill climb in the music industry.\nFrank n Dank's European Vacation CD and DVD released on July 24, 2007\n\nFrank n Dank & J Dilla's European Vacation The DVD included the last performances from J Dilla and Frank n Dank. Frank n Dankâ€™s European Vacation was released in 2007.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References =="

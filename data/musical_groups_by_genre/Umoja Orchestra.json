    "text": "The Umoja Orchestra was a Gainesville, Florida–based band whose music incorporated elements from afrobeat, jazz, funk, afro-cuban as well as traditional African, Caribbean and South American styles like salsa and merengue. The band's instrumentation was modeled closely to bands such as Fela Kuti's Africa 70 and the Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra.\nUmoja Orchestra was a strong presence in the Gainesville music scene. The band was especially known for its energetic, crowd-pleasing, and dance-oriented live performances, usually selling out local venues and putting on spectacular shows. They have gone on three national tours, mostly through the East Coast, but as far as Texas. The name \"Umoja\" comes from the Swahili word for \"unity\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nSebastián López Velásquez: Guitar, Vocals, Charango, Accordion\nNatalia Pérez: Vocals, Percussion\nMichael Pedron: Bass\nMichael Claytor: Banjo, Percussion\nDavid Borenstein: Saxophone, Clarinet\nIrving Campbell: Saxophone\nJason Prover: Trumpet\nEvan Hegarty: Keyboard\nKeegan Jerabek: Trumpet\nEvan Garfield: Drumset\nDoug Fischer: Trombone\nMicah Shalom: Trombone\nDavid Choo: Saxophone\nAdam Finkelman: Percussion, Timbales\nScott Bihorel: Congas\nScott Clayton: Guitar\nPaul Kronk: Guitar\nJohnny Frias: Congas\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDinner at the Republic 2009\nAbre la Puerta 2008\nUmoja Means Unity 2007\n\n\n== See also ==\nAfrobeat\nFela Kuti\nAntibalas Afrobeat Orchestra\nWorld Music\ndescarga\n\n\n== External links ==\nUmoja Orchestra On Myspace\nOfficial Website\nFacebook Page"

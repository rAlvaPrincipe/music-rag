The music video for The Time I Met The Devil received three nominations in the \"Kinsale Shark Awards\" for Best Music Video, Best Low Budget Music Video and Best Director.\nThe band had appeared on Irish TV's The Late Late Show with a performance of \"The Time I Met The Devil\". The band has also released a mashup of Bob Marley's \"Is This Love\" and Daft Punk's \"Digital Love\" on YouTube, which has over 100,000 views and it went onto win the 2016 Apple Of My Eye Le Crunch song competition. They have played at festivals including Electric Picnic, Longitude, Indiependence, Into The Wild and B.A.R.E in the Woods. The band also performed at half time at the 2018 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final at Croke Park.\nOn May 8, 2020, Brave Giant announced through their social media, that they are disbanding, after 9 years together.\nOn August 19, 2022, Brave Giant performed their last live event (The Last Dance) at the Marquee in Drumlish, County Longford.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn December 2011, Mark Prunty and Podge Gill formed a band called \"Dutch Courage\", their first gig was in their local bars, at their friends 21st birthday. In the months, they began to get more gigs and started to get a good reputation for themselves in their home county.\nIn March 2013, they were approached by Ross McNerney and joined their band. Shortly after, the three members decided to change their band name to \"Poroma\", as they wanted to direct their band to write their own material and their own unique sound. This is when their band started to get a good reputation for themselves outside their jurisdiction.\nIn August 2014, Emmet Collum filled in as the drummer for their show at the Marquee Festival in Drumlish, after their show, Emmett Collum turned down his opportunity to return to the United States, as he saw a better opportunity with the band in Ireland. Just months after, David Kilbride joined the band, as a bass player, to complete their full line-up.\nOnce their band had taken their final form, they decided to change their name to \"Brave Giant\" as the band was now completely different to the one that Mark Prunty and Podge Gill had shaped.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Lab 4 is a U.K. based hard trance act formed in 1994 by Adam Newman and Les Elston. The duo are known for their spectacular and raucous live performances.\n\n\n== History ==\nNewman and Elston had previously worked together in the industrial act M.A.D. Shortly after forming, the duo were asked to perform at Club UK, a nightclub that had previously played host to DJs such as Carl Cox and Laurent Garnier. They later played at London fetish club Torture Garden and have since played at the Brixton Academy, Global Gathering 2005 and at Infest in 2006.\nLab 4 were regularly played on BBC Radio 1 by the late DJ John Peel, who also invited Lab 4 to launch their third album Virus on one of his 'John Peel Sessions' at Maida Vale.\nIn September 2006 a statement was posted on the Lab 4 website that Lab 4 would be disbanding by the end of the year.  By 2009, the duo had reunited and were working together once more.\nIn November 2013 a Lab 4 tune, Gilgamesh, featured on the soundtrack for the Sci-Fi movie Time Lapse directed by Bradley King.  In 2019 the band split again with Newman departing to work in the AV industry, however Elston continued the Lab 4 act as a solo artist.  As of 2020 Lab 4 continue to release singles, such as a well received remix of Concept of Love.\nThe duo has performed across Great Britain, Europe, Australia, and Japan.  Lab 4 have won a number of awards for their live performances including from Mixmag and the UK Hard Dance Awards.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nNeurocide (LP, 1999, Trebleate Recordings)\nEvilution (LP, 2000, One Inch Records)\nDevilution (LP, 2001, Fragile)\nYoji Biomehanika Presents Lab 4 In the Mix (LP, 2001, Superb Trax)\nDevilution 2 (LP, 2002, Fragile)\nEvilution (LP, 2002, Superb Trax)\nVirus (LP, 2002, Tidy Trax)\nLaboratory 31.03.02 - Experiment 1 (LP, 2003, Fragile) (recorded at Camden Palace)\nDevilution 3 (LP, 2004, Fragile)\nLaboratory 04.04.04 - Experiment 2 (LP, 2004, Fragile) (recorded at Shepherd's Bush Empire)\nNone Of Us Are Saints (LP, 2006, Avex Trax)\nThe Tidy Magna Live Album (LP, 2009, Tidy Trax) (CD 1 is Lab 4, CD 2 Agnelli & Nelson, CD 3 Rob Tissera)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLab 4 discography at Discogs\nOfficial site\nadamlab4.com"

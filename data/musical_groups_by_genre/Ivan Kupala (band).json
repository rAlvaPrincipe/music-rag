The group mixes traditional Russian folk songs with electronic sounds, producing a unique blend of world music. The band is named for the traditional Slavic holiday.\nTheir debut album Kostroma (named after East Slavic fertility goddess) was highly praised by critics. \nIn 1999 and 2000, \"Ivan Kupala\" won \"Ovation\" awards as \"Folk group of the Year\". The title track \"Zdorovo, Kostroma\" was used in 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony.\nThe band has made a cultural impact reinventing an authentic Russian folklore.

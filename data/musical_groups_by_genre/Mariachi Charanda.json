    "text": "Mariachi Charanda is a traditional mariachi or “son” musical group from Mexico. The group works to conserve the version of this music, originally done only with string instruments, working with educational and cultural institutions to present this antique style of music all over Mexico and abroad.\nFounded in 1979, the group has been together over thirty years, with members José Luis Perujo on the violin, Javier Lassard on violin, Carlos Carral in Mexican vihuela, Sergio Mendez on guitarra de golpe, Emilio Perujo on guitarrón mexicano, with vocals by María Perujo.\nThe group’s repertoire mostly consists of traditional son music from western states, Jalisco, Colima, Nayarit and Michoacán, but it has incorporated some work from other regions in Mexico. Songs include El Capulinero, Atotonilco, El Sauce y la Palma, La Pulquería, México Lucido, El Toro Viejo, La Tequilera and El Huizache.\nMariachi Charanda collaborates with cultural and educational institutions such as the Secretaría de Educación Pública, CONACULTA and UNAM appearing on programs such as Radio Educación, Radio Universidad, Once TV, Cadena Tres and the Discovery Channel.

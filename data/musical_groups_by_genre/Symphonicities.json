    "text": "Symphonicities is the tenth studio album by English musician Sting, released on 14 July 2010 on Deutsche Grammophon. This is his first studio album featuring new recordings of existing songs drawn from both his solo career and from The Police (the second one to date being the 2019 studio album My Songs).  The title of the album is a play on that of The Police' 1983 album Synchronicity.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe album is a companion piece to the tour of the same name in which Sting, performing with the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, reinterprets some of his songs as classical symphonic compositions.  Symphonicities was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, and produced by Rob Mathes and Sting. Elliot Scheiner and Claudius Mittendorfer mixed the record, and it was mastered by Scott Hull.

The songs mixed influences from the 1980s and 1990s (the Cure, Lush) with more recent bands of a similar vein (Vivian Girls, Dum Dum Girls).\nWersing began recording demos on her own, and later with producer Jan-Niklas Jansen, at Bear Cave Studio in Cologne. When enough songs were ready to be aired live, she formed a group. Bassist Udo Westhoff, drummer Michael Boyle, and guitarist Caroline Arvensis joined in 2014. Though Arvensis was soon replaced by Diogo Oliveira, and he was later still replaced by Faith Taylor.\nThe group released a single \"No Moon\"/\"Dream on, Baby Blue\" for the Odd Box Records' 100 Club series in early 2015, then later that year released their self-titled debut album on Fortuna Pop!.\nThe band played Indietracks festival in both 2015 and 2017.\nOn 11 September 2018 the band announced their second album with lead single \"No Goodbyes\". The album, entitled Shimmer And Spin, was released by Reckless Yes on 16 November.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Album ===\nChorusgirl - Fortuna Pop!, 12\" LP, CD, MP3 (2015)\nShimmer And Spin - Reckless Yes, 12\" LP, CD, MP3 (2018)\nColapso Calypso - Reckless Yes, 12\" LP, CD, MP3 (2022)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"No Moon\" / \"Dream on, Baby Blue\" - Odd Box Records, 7\" LP, CD, MP3 (2015)\n\n\n== References =="

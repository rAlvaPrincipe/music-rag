    "text": "Larisa Stow & Shakti Tribe is an American new age and pop-rock band from Long Beach, California that fuses Western and Eastern music with English and Sanskrit mantra.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nLarisa Stow started in the pop-rock music scene in the late 1990s. In 1999, she released the album Moment by Moment, which was produced by David Tickle. She won the Los Angeles Music Award for Singer/Songwriter of the Year.\nFor her second album Reaching In, Stow worked with producer Richard Hahn. Reaching In features kirtans (Indian call-and-response chanting) blended with western music. It was released in 2005, and re-released by Oreade Music in 2007. In 2011, Larisa Stow & Shakti Tribe released Rock On Sat Nam!.\n\n\n== Shakti Tribe Foundation ==\nIn 2007, the band began performing concerts for inmates inside prisons and jails, teaching the concepts of oneness, community, and self-love. The Shakti Tribe Peace Outreach Program was created to facilitate these prison events which is sponsored by the International Humanities Center, a nonprofit organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRS Code. They perform peace concerts and hold workshops in prisons, jails, recovery centers and juvenile systems. They also developed leadership and added inspirational speakers to their programs.\n\n\n== Members ==\nIn 2004, Larisa Stow & Gathering Guru was formed. The members were David Del Grosso on bass, Kimo Estores on guitar, Marti Walker on backing vocals, Christo Pellani on drums, and Onyay Pheori on violin and vocals. Pellani left the group in 2005, and Walker took over the role of percussion, playing seated on cajon & djembe while singing. In 2006, Del Grosso left the band due to health issues, and was replaced on bass by Cincinnati Ohio native Benj Clarke.\nIn the summer of 2006, the band changed its name to Larisa Stow & Shakti Tribe.

    "text": "The Sun Devil Marching Band (SDMB), also known as The Pride of the Southwest, is the athletic band of Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona.  The Sun Devil Marching Band motto is “Expect Great Things.” The acronym EGT is inscribed on a sign that hangs from the director's podium towering over the band's practice field, and is a symbol of the high standards that band members strive to meet. The ASU Band program, which includes the Marching, Pep, and Dixieland bands, is a part of the Sun Devil Athletics department. The band is currently under the direction of Director of Athletic Bands James G. \"The Hammer\" Hudson, who took over the program in 2006. The Sun Devil Marching Band is a major ambassador for Arizona State University and the state of Arizona. Each year almost 500,000 people are entertained by the band, which plays at home football at Sun Devil Stadium and as a pep band for basketball games at Wells Fargo Arena, homecoming, bowl game parades, other community events in the Valley, across the country, and even abroad.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn September 20, 1915, the Arizona Board of Education accepted and ratified the creation of the Tempe Bulldogs Marching Band under Mrs. Lillian Williams (1915–1917). Under her guidance she furnished on her own the band's instruments, uniforms, and repertoire of standard classical music. The Bulldogs Marching Band though would be discontinued due to World War I. Williams last appearance was during 1947 concert as then Sun Devil Marching Band director Felix E. McKernan honored her. The Bulldogs Marching Band return in 1929 under short tenure of the direction of John Paul Jones. In transition under the direction of Carl G. Hoyer in 1937 the band's first bowl appearance for the Tournament of Roses Parade where the band won second prize. Though that year Hoyer would leave after then Arizona governor, Benjamin Baker Moeur, rejected his Arizona State Song for the state song of Arizona. During Dr. Robert G. Lyon five-year tenure was the addition of new parade and marching formations as well as swing music. Under Felix E. McKernan direction saw the various changes taken place for the band and the school. In 1946, the school's, mascot was redesigned by former Disney illustrator, Bert Anthony, from the Bulldog to Sparky, the Sun Devil. McKernan made his marks in the band by composing the school's fight song Maroon & Gold, implementing script drill formations in pregame and halftime shows, holding auditions for instrumentation placing, offering scholarships to boost membership, recruiting high school band members, establishing Band Day, and formatting three weekly rehearsals. All of which laid the basis for band to grow rapidly. The band's growing reputation brought a lot of praise from directors across the nation such as Clarence Sawhill (1947–1952) of the USC Trojan Band proclaimed the band as \"The Best Marching Band in the Southwest.\"  McKernan's successor, Harold C. Hines, as well added to McKernan's body of work by holding band camp a week before the Fall semester begins, additions to pregame pageantry, 1957 implementing fireworks, band's active role in Proposition 200 in 1958 for university status, and establishing the Alumni Band for Homecoming Games. August 1974 initiated a new period in the history of the Sun Devil Band program with the hiring of two new directors. The two men brought a new style of marching and philosophy to ASU's band program. Dr. Richard E. \"Doc\" Strange (1974–1999) became Director of Bands and brought (now) Dr. Robert C. \"Coach\" Fleming (1974–2002) as assistant director of Bands; this position was ultimately elevated to associate director of Bands, and is now designated Director of Athletic Bands. The Marching Band gained national recognition by performing at the 1987 and 1997 Rose Bowl games and Tournament of Roses Parades. Also to the band's credit are performances at Arizona Cardinals, San Francisco 49ers, the then Los Angeles Raiders and Los Angeles Rams professional football games, Phoenix Suns professional basketball games, SeaWorld, Knott's Berry Farm, Disneyland, Universal Studios, SeaWorld San Diego, on the deck of the Navy carrier USS Ranger (CV-61), and the 1990 Coca-Cola Bowl in Tokyo, Japan. Of note during the San Francisco 49er gig fans were impressed by the Sun Devil Marching Band rendition of George Cory's I Left My Heart in San Francisco the franchise insisted on the band making a 1963 recording and continued on using it at 49ers home games.  On November 9, 1991, the Sun Devil Marching Band became the first Pac-10 marching band to receive the prestigious Sudler Trophy. This great honor is awarded (now biennially) to a college or university marching band that has demonstrated the highest musical standards and innovative marching routines and ideas. On multiple occasions, the band was invited by the NFL, to be part of the pregame and halftime festivities of Super Bowls XLII and XLIX in Glendale, Arizona.\n\n\n=== Directors ===\n\nSource:\n\nLillian Williams, 1915–1917\nJohn Paul Jones, 1929–1930\nCarl G.

In order to receive one credit hour for the class for full-time ASU students and non-degree community college students seeking the credit, enrollment in the class is required in order to obtain the credit hour. For individuals interested in participating in the Sun Devil Marching Band, but are not considered full-time degree seeking students at ASU are required to apply to ASU as non-degree students in order to register for the course. Currently an alternate “registration” route is offered for those who will only be registered for the marching band course(s), giving them the opportunity to participate in the Sun Devil Marching Band without incurring full tuition costs. Color Guard, Spirit Squad and Percussion have an additional class to add for one credit hour.\n\n\n=== The Fight Songs ===\n\n\"Maroon & Gold\", ASU's fight song, is a familiar tune for Sun Devils all over the country, but is not the only \"fight song\" at ASU. In 1940, during World War II, Fred Waring composed a piece for the Arizona State College called \"Fight, Arizona State (March On, Arizona)\" which had become lost in history until 2015 when director James G. Hudson discovered it in the archives. He arranged it to be a part of the pregame show during the band program's 100th anniversary. Also in the 1940s, band director Albert Davis wrote \"Go, Go Sun Devils\" (more commonly known to the band as \"The Al Davis Fight Song\"); to this day, though Davis retired in the 1950s, the Sun Devil Marching Band continues to play the Al Davis Fight Song in their pregame performance as the Sun Devils come out of the tunnel onto the field, and occasionally make up humorous lyrics.\nAnother fight song that was written for the school but used sparingly was the song penned by former ASU President, G. Homer Durham. It was called \"Sing a Song for ASU\" and was last used at homecomings in the very early 1970s.\n\n\n=== Stand Tunes Repertoire ===\nThe band not only performs during pregame and halftime of the football games, but also in the stands. The music in the stands is a combination of short and long tunes to help keep the energy in the stadium and keep the crowd excited. Songs used for stand tunes include popular past and contemporary songs from many genres of music. One such example is the excerpt from \"The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)\" that the band plays when ASU's defense takes the field.\n\n\n=== Special Appearance Performances ===\nIn the 2006 and 2007 seasons the band had opportunities of bringing in guest appearances of nationally and world-renowned recording artists for halftime performances.\n\nHorn-based soul band Tower of Power performing their hits You're Still a Young Man/ Diggin' on James Brown and Tower of PSo \"So Very Hard to Go\" / \"What is Hip?\" during November 18, 2006, game against UCLA Bruins\nRendition of  Juan Tizol's Caravan with The Boston Brass quintet during the October 13, 2007, game against Washington Huskies\nMusical legend and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Little Richard performing his hits Tutti Frutti; Jenny, Jenny; and Good Golly Miss Molly during Thanksgiving Day November 22, 2007, game against USC Trojans\nJourney founding member and lead guitarist Neal Schon accompanied by long-time keyboardist and backing vocalist Jonathan Cain performed the National Anthem before the September 28, 2013, game against USC Trojans\nMedley of Duke Ellington jazz standards with The Boston Brass during the football season opener against Northern Arizona University on September 3, 2016\n\n\n== Arizona State University Band Day ==\nThe first Band Day was held on December 4, 1948, in conjunction with the 1948 Homecoming. Since then, the ASU Sun Devil Marching Band hosts its Band Day on the football team's road game or bye week at Sun Devil Stadium. High school bands from all over the state of Arizona come to play for judges and their peers.  About 50+ high school bands perform, followed by the Sun Devil Marching Band. There is a morning block for one half of the bands to perform and a night block known as Sun Devil Showdown of the rest of the bands to perform which makes Band Day an all-day event, as well as making ASU Band Day the biggest marching band competition in the state. For the 2008 Band Day, the top high school band, Mesa Mountain View Toro Band won the first Dr. Robert \"Coach\" Fleming Outstanding Band Award in honor of the Sun Devil Marching Band's eleventh band director. Starting with the 2017 season, the ASU Sun Devil Marching Band will be hosting the ABODA State Marching Championships (DIV I, II, III, and IV) as an alternative to the traditional Band Day.\nRecent ASU Band Day shows\n\n\n== Pass in Review ==\nTowards the end of every marching season the band performs Pregame and all Halftime shows headlining the \"Pass in Review\" concert which was previously held in Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium. Digital and compact disc recordings of the Sun Devil Marching Band performance at Pass in Review are available through Sun Devil Marching Band Merchandise Website. Pass in Review also takes time to recognize upperclass band members who will not be returning the following year by allowing them to lead in a rendition of Maroon & Gold. Since 2010, Pass in Review has been held in Desert Financial Arena courtesy of Sun Devil Athletics Department.\n\n\n== Trips ==\nThe band has traveled all over the original Pac-10. Prior to 2009, the band made an annual trip to Los Angeles, California, for either the USC or UCLA games.  The band continues to travel bi-annually to Tucson, Arizona, to play against rival University of Arizona. They also follow the football team to any bowl game that they get invited to if funding is available. For the 2018 season, the band traveled to San Diego State University for the ASU vs. SDSU football game.\n\n\n=== Bowl game appearances ===\nThe 1940, 1941, 1997, 2004, 2014, 2017, and 2019 Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas\nThe 1950 and 1951 Salad Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona\nThe 1970 Peach Bowl in Atlanta, Georgia (now the Chick-fil-A Bowl)\nThe 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1977, and 1983 Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Arizona (now in Glendale, Arizona)\nThe 1978 Garden State Bowl in East Rutherford, New Jersey\nThe 1985, 2002, 2007, and 2013 Holiday Bowl in San Diego, California\nThe 1987 Freedom Bowl in Anaheim, California (dissolved in 1995, conference alliance merged with the Holiday Bowl)\nThe 1987 and 1997 Rose Bowl, the \"Granddaddy of them all\" in Pasadena, California\nThe 1990 Coca-Cola Bowl in Tokyo, Japan\nThe 1999 and 2000 Aloha Bowl in ʻAiea, Hawaii\nThe 2005 Insight Bowl and 2016 Cactus Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona (now the Cactus Bowl in Tempe, Arizona)\nThe 2011, 2018, and 2021 Las Vegas Bowl in Las Vegas, Nevada\nThe 2012 Fight Hunger Bowl in San Francisco, [California\n\n\n=== 2006 Sheraton Hawaii Bowl ===\nOn one occasion the band was unable to support the Sun Devil football team at the 2006 Sheraton Hawai’i Bowl in Honolulu (Halawa), Hawaii. The bowl payout for 2006 was $300,000 in addition the Pac-10 conference paid $389,000 (total $689,000) to offset expenses for the university. However, the university spent $824,000 total on the trip, losing $135,000 on the trip. In contrast the 1999 & 2000 Aloha Bowl paid $750,000 with no conference contribution, but with a higher ticket guarantee and only lost $70,000 on each trip. The bowl after decided to drop the Pac-10 Conference deal and made a current deal with Conference USA.\n\n\n== Uniforms ==\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n1915-1917 Cap and Coat\n1929 All White Uniform, Military Boots, and Dark Cape\n1938 Women's Bugle Corps wore Maroon and Gold Uniforms\n1947 Red Coats, White Pants, Red Officer-Style Hats, and White Shoes\n1954 Maroon Coats with Gold Overlay (Sparky embroidered center front), Maroon Pants with gold stripe, Maroon Shako hat with gold band top and bottom, Gold Plume, White shoes.

These new uniforms consist of white jackets fading into gold with a sunburst at the clip. In the middle of the sunburst is a mirror which represents the illumination of not only the sun, but also the bright personality a Sun Devil reflects. One arm of the jacket is maroon, while the other is gold. White gauntlets fastened with suns, and white gloves using Velcro finish the sleeves. A cape with the ASU lettering is added to the ensemble as a throwback to capes worn by the band in years past. The pants are purely black, rising to about chest level with the aid of suspenders. Black Viper marching shoes are used paired with equally black socks.\n\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThe marching band uses many different instruments of varying range and sound in its ranks. Providing a central point to tempo and beat by conducting on the sideline are the four Drum Majors. The hornline is divided into two major groups: woodwinds and brass. In addition to the hornline, the band also uses a percussion section that is divided into a marching battery of drums and a stationary sideline pit. With presence of a pit as part of the percussion section, it makes the Sun Devil Devil Marching Band one of the few college marching bands to field a pit. The other Pac-12 marching band currently fielding a pit is the Oregon Marching Band. The bottom bass drum in the battery section was known as \"thumper\". This bass was used for count offs for the band during march around the stadium, parades, and entering the field for halftime shows.\n\n\n=== Hornline ===\nHornline is sponsored by Jupiter Band Instruments. Historically, the hornline in the band use gold lacquer instruments.\n\n\n=== Percussion ===\n\nPercussion is sponsored by Mapex Drums and Majestic Percussion, Vic Firth Drumsticks, Remo, and Avedis Zildjian Company.

They formed the ASU PASIC Drumline in 1995 with Percussive Arts Society International Convention being held locally and hosted by Dr. J.B. Smith, Professor of Music and the Coordinator of Percussion Studies in the School of Music at Arizona State University, at Phoenix Civic Plaza in Phoenix, Arizona. With the recent sensation of indoor percussion has had few lines part take in it. Initially with the 1998 ASU Spring Line and with the addition of the pit during the 2006 marching season the staff formed the 2007 ASU Winter Drumline. Competing locally in the Winter Guard Arizona circuit as well as nationally in Winter Guard International Percussion Regionals in Phoenix and Las Vegas in order to qualify in Winter Guard International Percussion World Championship in Dayton, Ohio.

    "text": "OLD (originally an acronym for Old Lady Drivers) was an American heavy metal band from Bergenfield, New Jersey, formed in 1986 and signed to Earache Records. It featured Alan Dubin on vocals, and James Plotkin on guitars and programming; they later formed the experimental doom metal band Khanate.\n\n\n== History ==\nOLD formed from the remains of Plotkin's previous band, the short-lived grindcore act \"Regurgitation\".  OLD's first album, entitled \"Old Lady Drivers\", continued in the humorous style of grindcore which characterized Regurgitation's material.\nAfter releasing a split EP with Ass√ºck in 1990, Plotkin recruited former Nirvana guitarist Jason Everman for their second album, Lo Flux Tube (1991).  This album featured more avant-garde and industrial metal influences in addition to grindcore, giving them a sound which was compared by some reviewers to a more uptempo Godflesh.  Lo Flux Tube also featured saxophone work by guest musician John Zorn.\nOLD continued their avant-garde direction with their third album, The Musical Dimensions Of Sleastak (1993).  Several tracks from that album, \"A Beginning\", \"Two of Me (Parts One and Two)\", \"Freak Now\", and \"Peri Cynthion\", appeared in the 1994 film Brainscan.\nAlso in 1993, the band released Hold On To Your Face, an album of remixes.  The band's final album, Formula (1995), delved into further experimentation with techno and industrial music.  OLD broke up shortly after releasing this album.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== At the time of the breakup ===\nJames Plotkin (guitars, programming)\nAlan Dubin (vocals)\n\n\n=== Previous members ===\nJason Everman (bass)\nRalph Pimentel (drums)\nHerschel Gaer (bass)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAll releases were on Earache Records, except where otherwise noted.\n\nOld Lady Drivers (Full-length), 1988\nColostomy Grab-Bag (Single), 1989\nAssuck/Old Lady Drivers (Split), 1990 (No System Records)\nDemo 1990 (self-produced)\nLo Flux Tube (Full-length), 1991\nHold On To Your Face (remixes) (Full-length), 1993\nThe Musical Dimensions Of Sleastak (Full-length), 1993\nFormula (Full-length), 1995\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOLD at Earache Records\nOLD's Myspace page\nInterview with James Plotkin circa 1993\nBandcamp"

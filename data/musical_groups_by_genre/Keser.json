    "text": "Keser are a Scottish band from Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland. Keser are signed to UK indie label Alex Tronic Records, and have released three albums to date, Esoteric Escape, Robo Ghost and Audeamus. The first two albums were recorded at the Alex Tronic Records studio, with label manager and record producer Paul Croan, who also releases music as artist Alex Tronic. Audeamus was recorded at Keser's studio in Glasgow, Hidden Channel.\nWhen performing live, Keser lean towards an instrumental, heavy, and distorted approach but will also perform quieter ambient textures within their music. This musical dynamic draws comparisons to genres like shoegaze, rock music, metal and post rock. Their live set up involves electric guitar, bass, keyboards, drum machines, effects, and samplers.\n\n\n== Live highlights ==\nKeser toured their debut album in Scandinavia with shows in Norway and Denmark during December 2006.

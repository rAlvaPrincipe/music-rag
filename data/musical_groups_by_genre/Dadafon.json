    "text": "Dadafon (established in 1995 in Trondheim, Norway) was a Norwegian experimental jazz band, originally called Coloured Moods (name changed in 2000), initiated by drummer Martin Smidt, and including Kristin Asbjørnsen (vocals), Carl Haakon Waadeland (drums), Jostein Ansnes and Bjørn Ole Solberg. The band had African music influences.\nLead singer Kristin Asbjørnsen brought an authority to their sound that many female rock singers may shy away from as she not only has the range to lead such a strong band of musicians, but also the vocal power to take their songs to new heights. They performed songs in Norwegian and English. Dadafon and Kristin Asbjønsen, performed most of the songs on the Factotum sound track, like slow day.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Present members ===\nKristin Asbjørnsen - vocals (1995- )\nJostein Ansnes - guitar (1995- )\nBjørn Ole Solberg - saxophone (1995- )\nØyvind Engen - cello (2004- )\nEirik Øien - bass (2002- )\nMartin Viktor Langlie - drums (2004- )\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nMartin Smidt - drums, percussion & xylophone (1995-2002)\nCarl Haakon Waadeland - drums (1995-2002)\nKenneth Kapstad - drums (2002–04)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1998: Coloured Moods (Rim Records)\n2001: And I Can't Stand Still (Rim Records)\n2002: Visitor (Via Music)\n2004: Harbour (Universal Spain)\n2005: Lost Love Chords (EmArcy Records)\n2006: Factotum (Milan), music for the film by Bent Hammer\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAllmusic.com\nDadafon Biography on Last.fm\nDadafon Biography on Emarcy.com"

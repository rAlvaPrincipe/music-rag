    "text": "PLANCK STARS (プランクスターズ) is a five-member Japanese idol girl group from Hiroshima. They made their debut in 2018 and reached mainstream success in 2021. Their music is a mix of Rock and electronic dance music.\nThe concept behind them is described as \"free-spirited delinquents.\" The name sounds like \"pranksters\", which describes many controversies in which the group has been involved. Their antics have ranged from a member exiting the stage mid-song to buy a churro (and not returning until the very end of the concert), to releasing 300 live crickets in the audience. Members have also hammered the ceiling of a venue; slept on stage; stepped on a fan; thrown ink and soy sauce at the audience; spit watermelon seeds into a fan's mouth; and made a fan drink detergent.\nThe concept was born from a desire to go against Japanese idol girl groups culture, who tend to face a lot of boundaries on who they can be and how they must act in public. Members perform wearing extravagant clothing, sing foulmouthed lyrics, and even have a monkey and a dog as official members.\nOne of their most famous pranks happened in 2022, when they held a competition to see which member could sell more tickets to a concert, with the winner getting a bike and the one who sold the least tickets having to make an \"AV\", which many assumed to stand for \"adult video\". However, the member who had to star in the video was Puri-chan, the dog, who obviously didn't sell a single ticket. Puri-chan then starred in a video playing in a park, an \"Animal Video\".\nIn 2022, they released their first mini-album, called Ochi Omega Rema, which reached the 1st place on the Oricon Albums Chart.\nThey have toured in countries like Thailand, United States, England, Taiwan and South Korea. They have made songs inspired by these places.\nIn 2024, they performed in Brazil for the first time at Anime Summit, in Brasília.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAll members have stage names, which are:\nMajikami☆Kanna\nAnaru Rairai\nKoharu Nushi\nMomoshikiya Furukinokibano Shinobunimo Naoamariaru Mukashinarikeri\nEmma Chacha\n\n\n== Former members ==\nKarei pan Yotsuba\nHebina Erika\nMana Tissue Fold\nTanaka Iroha (left the group citing it to be \"psychologically impossible to continue\")\nSumi Tan\nChan Richan\nHikicomo Ricca\nuyu\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n\n\n== References =="

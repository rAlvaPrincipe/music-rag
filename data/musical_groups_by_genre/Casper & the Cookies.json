    "text": "Casper & the Cookies is an American rock and pop band from Athens, Georgia, United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nMulti-instrumentalist and singer Jason NeSmith (pronounced \"KNEE-smith,\" no relation to Michael Nesmith of the Monkees), began using the pseudonym Casper Fandango in 1996 as a moniker for his solo four-track recordings.  NeSmith was given the name by fellow Atlanta musician David Dault while playing together in the band Feyerabend.\nCasper Fandango released two DIY cassettes in the late 1990s, originally as Casper Fandango & the Knees and subsequently Casper Fandango & His Tiny Sick Tears.\nThe Cookies came into existence in 1998 as NeSmith's live band. They have three CDs released on Happy Happy Birthday to Me Records, Oh! (2004), The Optimist's Club (2006), and Modern Silence (2009). After many lineup changes the band consists of NeSmith, Kay Stanton, Davy Gibbs, and AJ Griffin.\nNeSmith was a member of Of Montreal for the Satanic Panic in the Attic tour of 2004 and some of the Sunlandic Twins tour of 2005, eventually leaving to focus on his own band. (Kay and Jason are also in Supercluster, the side project of Vanessa Briscoe Hay of Pylon.) NeSmith has also been a member of Kenny Howes & the Yeah!, Orange Hat, the Visitations, the Late BP Helium and the Sunshine Fix. He also owns and operates a commercial recording facility, Bel*Air Studio.\nCasper & the Cookies served as the backing band for Daniel Johnston at the 2007 Athens Pop Fest. Also in 2007, the Cookies went on a nationwide tour supporting the Apples in Stereo.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent\n\nJason NeSmith (aka Casper Fandango)\nKay Stanton\nDavy Gibbs\nAJ Griffin\nFormer\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nConsumer (cassette; as Casper Fandango & the Knees) – Lookit Meee! – 1996\nHow's Your Hand?

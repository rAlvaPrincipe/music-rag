Initial auditions took place in September 2006 under the auspices of the Cobb Symphony Orchestra (which changed its name to the Georgia Symphony Orchestra in 2011).\nBy the 2007 season, over 160 students constituted GYSOâ€™s full orchestras, Philharmonia and the Symphony Orchestra, while over 30 students participated in the GYSO Sinfonia. In addition to the three orchestra programs, nearly 30 students participated in an authentic British-style Brass Band and just under a dozen students were in a Percussion Ensemble. In 2009, two choruses were added to the program.\nThe GYSO has become the largest youth orchestra in the Southeast.\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Pocahaunted (often shortened by the band to P-haunt) was a hypnagogic pop project based in Los Angeles, California founded in 2005 by Amanda Brown and Bethany Cosentino.\n\n\n== History ==\nAmanda Brown founded Not Not Fun Records in 2005; she and friend Bethany Cosentino formed the duo Pocahaunted the following year after Brown had a dream about it. The group released over a dozen albums, a few EPs/singles, and several split releases, generally preferring the vinyl and cassette formats over compact disc. Their releases often have handmade/hand-painted artwork. The group toured heavily since its inception and had its music released by a wide array of experimental record labels, including ones based in Europe. Cosentino left the group in 2010 to attend college in New York City, founding the duo Best Coast with Bobb Bruno while there. This necessitated a lineup overhaul, including the addition of Brown's husband Britt on guitar, as well as Diva Dompe (Blackblack), Leyna Noel Tilbor (Psychic Reality), and M. Geddes Gengras. The group disbanded in August 2010.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nPocahaunted's sound underwent many stylistic shifts. Their early music was primarily based on improvised drones and filled with disorienting reverb and dub production techniques. During this time, they often called themselves the \"Olsen twins of drone\", in a tongue-in-cheek manner. After Cosentino left, the new lineup re-emerged with a more upbeat, funk rock-based sound, while retaining dubby bass lines and a tribal overall sound.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nMoccasinging – Not Not Fun (2006)\nA Tear for Every Grain of Sand – Fuck It Tapes (2007)\nPocahaunted – Ruralfaune [France] (2007)\nSplit w/ Robedoor – Digitalis Recordings (2007)\nRough Magic – Blackest Rainbow (2007)\nChains – Teenage Teardrops (2008)\nPeyote Road – Woodist (2008)\nBeast That You Are – Night People (2008)\nIsland Diamonds – Arbor Infinity (LP, 2008) / Not Not Fun (CD w/ 2 bonus tracks, 2008)\nMirror Mics – Weird Forest (2008)\nLive from the New Age – Not Not Fun (2009)\nPassage – Troubleman Unlimited (2009)\nMake It Real – Not Not Fun (LP/CD/cassette) (2010)\n\n\n=== EPs and singles ===\nWhat the Spirit Tells Me – Buried Valley (2006)\nSplit w/ Mythical Beast – Not Not Fun (2007)\nEmerald Snake On Ruby Velvet – Not Not Fun (2007)\nWater-Born – Not Not Fun (2007)\nNative Seduction – Arbor (2007)\nSplit w/ Charalambides – Not Not Fun (2008)\nBearskin Rug – Not Not Fun (2008)\nSplit w/ Orphan Fairytale – Release the Bats [Sweden] (2008)\nGold Miner's Daughters – Excite Bike Tapes (2009)\nThreshold – Not Not Fun (2010)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMyspace\nBiography at AllMusic Guide\nDiscography/reviews at Rate Your Music\nDiscography at Discogs\nInterview in L.A.

    "text": "Happy Apple is an American jazz trio from Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nInitially formed in 1996 by David King (drums), Michael Lewis (saxophone), Anton Denner (saxophone) and Cully Swansen (bass), since 1998 the lineup has consisted of King, Lewis, and bass guitarist Erik Fratzke.\nAll three members compose music for the group, which places equal emphasis on improvisation. Happy Apple plays a brand of jazz music drawing on several other genres; the group's members play in other bands ranging from indie rock and heavy metal to free jazz and electronic. The best known of these is The Bad Plus, in which King also plays drums.\nThe name Happy Apple comes from a Fisher-Price toy from the 1970s which King often uses as an auxiliary percussion instrument.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nReviewing the group's 2003 album Youth Oriented, CMJ New Music Report said that \"Happy Apple has an edgy appeal, fueled by its elastic sense of rhythm and dynamics. The band can groove hard for extended stetches, playing with the singlemindedness of a rock group, or it can sit in one place, working on a freetime idea just as comfortably.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nBlown Shockwaves & Crash Flow (Self-released, 1997)\nPart of the Solutionproblem (No Alternative, 1998)\nBody Popping Moon Walking Top Rocking (No Alternative, 1999)\nJazzercise with the Elders/E Equals What I Says It Does/God Bless Certain Portions of the USA (Self-released, 2000)\nPlease Refrain from Fronting (Self-released, 2001)\nYouth Oriented (Sunnyside, 2003)\nThe Peace Between Our Companies (Sunnyside, 2004 Europe, 2005 North America)\nHappy Apple Back on Top (Sunnyside, 2007)\nNew York CD (Self-released, 2020 (digital); Sunnyside, 2024 (CD))\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site"

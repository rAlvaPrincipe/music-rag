    "text": "The Clutha were a traditional Scottish band hailing from Glasgow, that released a small number of albums in the 1970s.  The line-up on the Clutha's first album, Scotia (1971), was John Eaglesham (vocal, concertina), Erlend Voy (fiddle, concertina, vocals), Calum Allan (fiddle), Ronnie Alexander (vocals, guitar) and Gordeanna McCulloch (vocals).  The same band members are credited on their 1974 album, Scots Ballads Songs & Dance Tunes.  By the time of their 1977 release, The Bonnie Mill Dams, Jimmy Anderson had joined the group on chamber pipes and bagpipes, and Eaglesham had left the group.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1957, Norman Buchan was a teacher at Rutherglen Academy. He formed a Ballads Club. Among the pupils who joined up were Gordeanna McCulloch. She  fell in love with singing, and travelled to London to attend one of Ewan MacColl's weekend seminars at his home in Beckenham, Kent. She sang briefly with the Clydesiders a group formed at school, and in 1964 joined The Clutha. The name is the Latin word for the Clyde. The band played traditional Scottish tunes and sang songs in  Scots.\n\n\n=== The Small Pipes ===\nWhen The Clutha added Jimmy Anderson on the lowland pipes on \"Bonnie Mill Dams\" (1977) they were pioneers, in that the instrument had rarely been heard for 100 years, and not previously recorded. They won the Peter Cooke Cup for Scots ceilidh bands in 1971, 1972 and 1973. Although they did not record again until 2001, they have continued to host ceilidh dances. In 2001, The Clutha released an album entitled On the Braes, with Ronnie Alexander (vocals, guitar), Erlend Voy (fiddle, concertina, vocals), Callum Allan (fiddle), Gordeanna McCulloch (vocals) and Tom Johnstone (pipes).\n\n\n=== McCulloch solo ===\nIn 1965, McCulloch appeared on a compilation album on Topic Records. In 1978 she released her own solo album, Sheath and Knife, on which she unearthed obscure Scottish songs. Since then she has appeared on six compilation albums and recorded another solo album. To cover McCulloch's absence during a Brittany tour by the band, they temporarily recruited Heather Heywood to stand in as a vocals singer.\nMcCulloch died in 2019.\n\n\n=== Norman Buchan MP ===\nBuchan became a Labour Member of Parliament and was the organiser of the Edinburgh Folk Festival for several years.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Clutha\n\nScotia!

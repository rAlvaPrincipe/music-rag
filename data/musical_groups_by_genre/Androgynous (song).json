    "text": "\"Androgynous\" is a song by the Replacements featured on their 1984 album Let It Be. The song, which has been described as \"decades ahead of its time\" describes in positive terms a romantic relationship between two gender non-conforming individuals, and expresses hope that in the future such people and their personal relationships will be more accepted.\nTowards the end of the song, Paul Westerberg can be heard singing the words \"Jefferson's Cock\".  Occasionally, the Replacements would play gigs in Minneapolis under this name, with the band members wearing dresses.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nCrash Test Dummies' music video for \"Androgynous\" features the band performing at a fair attended by many gender queer individuals. Joan Jett's music video features Jett singing the song as a story from a children's book in a library in front of a group of young children, with the details and the characters of Dick and Jane from the song portrayed in the video. The video features fellow musician John Doe as Dick, the author of the book, and with Jett portraying Jane.

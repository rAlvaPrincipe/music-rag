    "text": "Kalevala (Russian: Калевала) is a Russian folk metal band.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe name of the band is derived from the Finnish national epic. The group chose this name because of lead vocalist Xenia Markevich's Finnish parents. Moreover, the band is inspired by ancient Finnish and Sami music, Finno-Ugric legends, and contemporary Finnish bands like Finntroll, Korpiklaani, etc.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter a concert in Penza on 15 April 2007 with Nevid, singer Xenia and guitarist Nikita Andrianov decided to leave the band and start a new one. Together with keyboardist and accordion player Alexandr Oleinikov, bassist Alexandr Schmel, and drummer Mark Vasili, they started Kalevala.\nIn April 2008, the band released their debut album, Kudel Belosnezhnogo L'na. One year later, they came out with their second record, Kukushkiny Djeti, followed by Vjed'ma a year after.\nIn 2016, Kalevala held their first concert tour outside of the former Soviet Union, named Hail the Spring!, visiting Eastern Europe, France, and Berlin, Germany.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent\n\nXenia Markevich – vocals\nNikita Andrianov – guitar\nAlex Mitrofanov – bass\nDenis Zolotov – drums\nAleksandr \"olen\" Oleynikov – accordion, keyboards\nPast\n\nMark Vasili – drums\nAleksandr \"bumblebee\" Smel – bass, mouth harp\nKirill \"Kesha\" Perov – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nKudel Belosnezhnogo L'na / Кудель белоснежного льна (2008)\nKukushkiny Deti / Кукушкины дети (2009)\nVed'ma / Ведьма (2010)\nLuna I Grosh / Луна и Грош (2013)\nMetel / Метель (2017)\nEPs\n\nТаусень-Рада (2009)\nДоху я купила (2014)\nLive albums\n\nOsen v stile folk / Осень в Стиле фолк (2012)\nSingles\n\n\"Demo '07\" (2007)\n\"Tausen-rada / Таусень-рада\" (2009)\n\"Kolocolchick / Колокольчик\" (2009)\n\"Сон-река\" (2011)\n\"Волчий зов\" (2014)\n\"Благодар тебе, Велесе\" (2020)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

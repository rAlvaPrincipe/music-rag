    "text": "Vomito Negro is a Belgian electronic band formed in 1983. The name is Spanish and Portuguese for \"black vomit\", a phenomenon that arises in the last stage of the disease yellow fever.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter numerous successful releases like Shock, Human and The New Drug, and discontent with the result of their last studio album Fireball, Gin Devo decided to put Vomito Negro aside for a while and to invest all his energy and creativity in his new project called Pressure Control and released the debut album Vamp. After only two more concerts Guy Van Mieghem sold his studio equipment and stopped all musical activities. In 2008 Gin decided to bring back Vomito Negro. After asking BORG, who already was a member of Gin Devo's side project Pressure Control, to join the band. While they successfully toured Europe from 2008 until 2009, the duo started working on the new album.\nOn January 22, 2010, the band released Skull & Bones through Out of Line Records. Some of these new tracks like \"Black Tie, White Shirt\" and \"Darkmoon\" were already tested on the crowd of the WGT Festival, in Leipzig and the Bimfest in Antwerp.\nIn February 2010, just after its release, Skull & Bones entered the German Alternative Charts (DAC) on the tenth position, only to climb further up to the second position one week later. Meanwhile, the remake version of their club classic \"Move Your Body (V2K10)\", which is featured on the bonus disc of the limited edition version, entered the DAC's single charts and reaching 13th place.\nIn January 2013, the band released the album Fall of an Empire.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nM.A.C.S.\nVomito Negro (1985)\nDare (1987)\nStay Alive (1987)\nMusical Art Conjunct of Sound (1989)\nShock (1989)\nHuman (1990)\nSave the World (1990)\nThe New Drug (1991)\nCompiled (1992)\nWake Up (1992)\nMusical Art Conjunct of Sound (2000)\nFireball (2002)\nSkull & Bones (2010)\nSlave Nation(EP) (2011)\nFall of an Empire (2013)\nDeath Sun (2014)\nBlack Plague (2017)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

    "text": "Sister Hazel is an American rock band from Gainesville, Florida, whose style blends elements of jangle pop, folk rock, classic rock, and Southern rock. They are best known for their 1997 single \"All for You.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nSister Hazel formed in Gainesville, Florida, in 1993 and was named for Sister Hazel Williams, a local missionary who ran a homeless shelter. The group released its self-titled debut album in 1994, through its independent record label Croakin' Poets. Shortly after its release, singer/guitarist Ryan Newell and drummer Mark Trojanowski joined the band. Newell played on the album before officially joining the group.\nThe band's second album ...Somewhere More Familiar was released in 1997 and sold approximately 30,000 copies through its initial pressing, prompting Universal Records to sign the band. Universal re-released ...Somewhere More Familiar in late 1997. A single from the album All For You hit No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains the band's most successful single.\nThe band's third album Fortress was released in 2000 by Universal. The band worked with producers Mike Clink (Guns N' Roses, Mötley Crüe, Heart), Richie Zito (Cheap Trick), and Paul Ebersold (3 Doors Down). The album featured minor pop hits \"Champagne High\" and \"Change Your Mind.\"  The album's title track was featured as the outro of Valparaiso University radio station WVUR's weekly Saturday night program during the 2000–01 academic year.\nIn 2003, after the band split from Universal, they released their fourth studio album, Chasing Daylight, on the Sixthman label and toured throughout the year to promote the album. The band's internet presence emerged during this time period, and hardcore fans dubbing themselves \"Hazelnuts\" studied setlists, shared bootleg concert recordings, and initiated a promotion scheme with the band through their official website. 2003 also saw the simultaneous release of Live*LIVE, a two-disc live album, and A Life in the Day, a live DVD.\nIn 2004, Sister Hazel released their next studio album, Lift. Songs from Lift were re-recorded for 2005's Lift: Acoustic Renditions, an EP of studio acoustic takes on five of the songs, offered exclusively through Apple's iTunes Store. In July 2005, the Sister Hazel album was re-issued again by Sixthman, in response to claims that the album had become difficult to find in stores.\nSister Hazel then promoted their album, Absolutely, which was released on October 10, 2006. The band also continued to tour and hold annual fan gathering events, The Rock Boat and The Rock Slope. Absolutely is the band's highest-charting album on the Billboard charts following Fortress and it received 4 out of a possible 5 stars from Allmusic, a tie with Fortress's score.\nOn June 5, 2007, Sister Hazel released a \"hybrid\" album, BAM! Volume 1. It contains B-sides from the Absolutely recording sessions and some from previous albums. Sister Hazel also released a holiday album called Santa's Playlist on September 25, 2007.\nOn February 9, 2008, the band performed a live concert at Daytona International Speedway for the Budweiser Shootout. They released a live acoustic album on June 17, 2008, Before the Amplifiers, Live Acoustic on Croakin' Poets/Rock Ridge Music.  The record features 16 tracks, including the band's hits, fan favorites, and live concert staples, all in a stripped-down, acoustic format.  The album was recorded on January 12 at Nickel & Dime Studios in Atlanta (other bands who have recorded there in the past include Indigo Girls, The B-52's, Shawn Mullins) in front of a hundred fans who were chosen at random from more than five thousand entries.\nAt the July 18, 2008, concert at Wolf Trap Farm Park, drummer Mark Trojanowski took paternity leave for his newborn child. Former Vertical Horizon and current Doobie Brothers drummer Ed Toth played in his absence.\nOn July 9, 2009 Ford Motor Company announced a collaboration with Sister Hazel to promote the company's new Sync technology, available on many Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles.  The band was featured on a Ford website, syncmyride.com.\nThe band released their seventh studio album of original songs (tenth album overall) on August 18, 2009.  The album, entitled Release, contains 12 tracks and is on the Rock Ridge Music label.  On the day of release, Release was the number one album on iTunes.\nLess than six months after releasing Release, the band returned to the studio to work on their new album, Heartland Highway, was released on October 12, 2010. Its first radio single was \"Stay a While\".\nThe band's ninth studio album, Lighter in the Dark, was announced in the later part of 2015. It is their first country album, and was released on February 19, 2016. The lead single from the album is \"We Got It All Tonight\". Two songs, \"We Got It All Tonight\" and \"Karaoke Song\", which features country artist Darius Rucker, were made available for instant download for those who pre-ordered the album.\nThe band's namesake Dr. Hazel Kirkland Williams died on July 16, 2016, at age 91 in Gainesville.\nThe band released an EP Water on February 9, 2018, which featured the lead single \"Roll On Bye\". Less than a week after the release of Water, the band announced they had begun recording a follow-up EP in Nashville, Tennessee.  The EP Wind was released on September 7, 2018.  The next EP in the \"Elements\" series, Fire, was released on February 8, 2019. The final installment in the \"Elements\" series, Earth, was released on September 6, 2019. Each of the EPs in the series included a portion of a song at the end, intended to be linked together in a future release. On November 26, 2019, all the EPs were combined into a single release, Elements. The 25-song, double-disc set includes the final \"Elements\" song pieced together.\n\n\n== Use in media ==\nThe band has had music featured in several movies and soundtracks including Major League: Back to the Minors, The Wedding Planner, Clay Pigeons, Bedazzled and 10 Things I Hate About You.  Sister Hazel also appear on the Fleetwood Mac tribute album, Legacy:  A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac's Rumours with their cover version of \"Gold Dust Woman\".  In 1999, they recorded a cover of \"September Gurls\" for the Big Star tribute album, Big Star, Small World.  However, the track was not included when the album was released in 2006. The song \"Where Do You Go\" was featured on Scrubs (Season 6, Episode 4, \"My House\"). \"All For You\" was featured in episode 7 of the first season of The Way Home (TV series)\n\n\n== Musical style ==\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nWhile some of the band members feel like their sounds are simply Sister Hazel, Ryan Newell has cited Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmy Page, Van Halen, and Eric Clapton as his influences.

    "text": "The Orchestra of Opera North (or English Northern Philharmonia as recording name) is the orchestra that plays for the Opera North.\nIt was founded as the English Northern Philharmonia, and changed its name during the period when Steven Sloane was Opera North's Music Director.  Since the Royal Scottish National Orchestra ceased to play for Scottish Opera, the OON is the only orchestra in Britain which performs throughout the year in concert halls as well as opera houses.\nThe orchestra made a number of recordings for Naxos Records under former Opera North Music Directors Paul Daniel and David Lloyd-Jones.\n\n\n== References ==\nOrchestra page on the Opera North site\nOON on the Association of British Orchestras site"

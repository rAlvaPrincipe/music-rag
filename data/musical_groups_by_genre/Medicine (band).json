    "text": "Medicine are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1990 by guitarist/keyboardist Brad Laner.\nThey are perhaps best known for their cameo appearance in the 1994 film The Crow, in which they performed \"Time Baby II\", although the soundtrack album included a different version titled \"Time Baby III\" (featuring guest vocals from the Cocteau Twins' Elizabeth Fraser).\n\n\n== History ==\nMedicine was formed by ex-Savage Republic drummer Brad Laner, based on some 4-track recordings Laner was working on in 1990. After playing the tapes for music industry representatives, he was told that if he formed a band that sounded like the tapes, he could get a record deal. Laner then assembled a band of musicians from the Los Angeles music scene. Medicine's early lineup included Laner, drummer Jim Goodall (Severed Head in a Bag, Jon Wayne, Lopez Beatles, Flying Burrito Brothers), guitarist Jim Putnam, bassist Eddie Ruscha and singer Annette Zilinskas (an original member of the Bangles). Zilinskas left before any official releases and was replaced by former Fourwaycross singer Beth Thompson. On the basis of the original demo, the band was signed to Creation Records, becoming the first American band to do so. In America, Medicine signed to Rick Rubin's American Recordings label in 1992. With a signature guitar tone, created by running Laner's guitar through a Yamaha 4-track recorder, Medicine's music managed to distinguish itself from some of the more ambiguous endeavors of the shoegaze movement.\nTheir first album, Shot Forth Self Living, was released in 1992. It received airplay on college radio and coverage in alternative newspapers, with even a few of their videos played on MTV.\nTheir second album, The Buried Life, was released the following year, and gained Medicine more mainstream attention, including coverage in magazines like Creem.  \nFor their third album, Her Highness (1995), Matt Devine and Justin Meldal-Johnsen replaced Putnam and Ruscha, respectively. The band broke up soon after, and Laner formed supergroup Lusk.\nMedicine reformed briefly in 2003, solely as a duo including Laner and Shannon Lee, the daughter of actor Bruce Lee. They released one album, The Mechanical Forces of Love.\nThe band's core lineup of Laner, Thompson and Goodall later reformed again and signed with the Captured Tracks label. Medicine released a new studio album, To the Happy Few, in July 2013, preceded by the single \"Long as the Sun\". On October 27, 2014, they released their sixth studio album, Home Everywhere.\nMedicine's 2019 album Scarred for Life featured Laner, Goodall, Zilinskas, and Devine.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nPitchfork has hailed Medicine as the closest thing to being an American answer to My Bloody Valentine.\nIn 2012, Captured Tracks reissued Medicine's first two albums, 1992's Shot Forth Self Living and 1993's The Buried Life,  with bonus material and rarities, as part of their Shoegaze Archive series.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nShot Forth Self Living (Def American/Creation, 1992)\nThe Buried Life (American, 1993)\nHer Highness (American, 1995)\nThe Mechanical Forces of Love (Wall of Sound/Astralwerks, 2003)\nTo the Happy Few (Captured Tracks, 2013)\nHome Everywhere (Captured Tracks, 2014)\nScarred For Life (Drawing Room Records, 2019)\nDrugs (Self-released, 2022)\nSilences (Self-released, 2023)\nOn The Bed (Self-released, 2024)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n\"Aruca\" (1992, Creation)\n\"5ive\" (1993, Creation)\n\"Never Click\" (1993, Beggars Banquet)\nSounds of Medicine EP (1994, American)\n\"Time Baby 3\" (1994, American)\n\"Candy Candy\" (1995, American)\n\"Off the Vine\" double 7\" (1995, Ectoplasm)\nWet on Wet EP (2002, Wall of Sound)\n\"I Smile to My Eyes\" (2003, Wall of Sound)\n\"As You Do\" (2004, Wall of Sound)\n\"Time Baby 2\" (2011, Captured Tracks)\n\"Long as the Sun\" (2013, Captured Tracks)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nAlways Starting to Stop (2012, Captured Tracks)\nIn Session (2013, Captured Tracks)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nRemains 1992-1995 (2011, self-released)\nBox Set (2012, Captured Tracks)\n2.0 Extraneous (2017, Drawing Room Records)\nFalls (2019, Brava Entertainment)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\n\"Miss Drugstore\" on Creation: Indie-Pop's Been Good to Us (1992, Indiecator)\n\"Never Click\" on Particle Theory (1993, Warner Bros.)\n\"Time Baby III\" on The Crow (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) (1994, Atlantic)\n\"Slut\" on The Doom Generation - Music from the Motion Picture (1995, American)\n\"One More Night\" on Tigerbeat6 Inc.

    "text": "Shunsuke Kazama (風間 俊介, Kazama Shunsuke, born June 17, 1983) is a Japanese actor and television personality.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1997, when Kazama was in his second year of junior high school, he entered Johnny & Associates and started activities as a trainee. He made his debut on stage that same year in a Shonentai stage play.\nIn 1999, he played Kenjiro Kanesue in Kinpachi-sensei. His performance earned him the Nikkan Sports Drama Grand Prix award for Best Newcomer.\nIn 2002, Kazama was member of unit \"FOURTOPS\" with fellow trainees Tomohisa Yamashita, Toma Ikuta, and Jun Hasegawa. The quartet hosted Shounen Club, a Johnny's Jr. variety show. In September 2003, Yamashita was chosen to be a member of a new unit, News. FOURTOPS was dissolved with News' debut, and the remaining members would focus on acting. They reunited in 2018 for Fuji Television's Year-End show Johnny's Countdown as back dancers for duo Tackey & Tsubasa, just as they did in the group's original days, for the duo's final appearance on the show.\nIn 2011, Kazama won a Television Drama Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\nHe was a member of TU→YU in 2008, along with V6's Hiroshi Nagano, NEWS's Takahisa Masuda, Hey! Say! JUMP's Hikaru Yaotome and actor Tatsuya Takeda.\nHe starred in the feature-length film Maebashi Visual Kei, as a young farmer who tries to make it big in a visual kei band.\nWhen fellow Johnny Kazunari Ninomiya from Arashi, with whom Kazama has a close friendship, opened Twitter in 2023, he included a link to Kazama's Johnny's Web profile as if it were his own, much to the amusement of both their fans.\nMostly known as an actor, Kazama's musical career is basically non-existent, except for a few units at the beginning. So he was happy to receive a present from fellow Johnny and long time friend (Arashi's) Masaki Aiba. On 28 September 2023, at the last airing of the program VS Damashii in which both appeared, Aiba as \"captain\" and he as \"assistant captain\". Aiba gifted Kazama (and all the Damashii members) a CD copy of the show's theme song \"New Again! Again and again!\" saying, \"Congratulations on your CD debut, Kazama-kun\", to what Kazama responded, \"This is the first CD that includes my voice in 26 years (of my entertainment career).\"\nIt was announced on 16 December 2023 that Kazama would be leaving the agency by year's end, to work as a freelance actor.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKazama married a non-celebrity woman in 2013, after dating for ten years. According to some gossip sites and fan blogs,  Kazama's wife is former actress Kazuna Kawamura. Kawamura and Kazama met in 2004 during the performance of the play \"Claudia\", a first for Kawamura, who relied in the experience that Kazama had at that time. According to those sites, the pair started dating when the play ended. When it came time to get married, months before, Kawamura announced her retirement from the industry. When Kazama reported the marriage, he named her as a non-celebrity woman, to keep prying eyes from their private life.\nKazama and his wife are parents of a boy, born around 2016. His existence was unknown until the child was 3 years old. According to people who have worked with him, Kazama is a very private person, and it isn't his intention to keep hidden his private life, just that he rarely speaks about it.\nOn December 22, 2020, Kazama's talent agency announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19. He made a full recovery on January 4.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Other TV shows ==\nZip!

    "text": "Churchwood is an avant-blues quintet from Austin, Texas known for its poetry-driven lyrics, high-energy performances, and eccentric approach to making blues-based rock and roll.\nThe lineup consists of Bill Anderson (guitar), Joe Doerr (vocals, harmonica), Adam Kahan (bass), Billysteve Korpi (guitar), and Eric Bohlke (drums).\n\n\n== Musical and lyrical style and influence ==\nChurchwood's musical influences are wide-ranging.  The band's self-proclaimed \"dystopic blues\" style belies its reverence for the likes of Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, and other blues masters; however, many critics suggest that musical risk-takers like Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band, Tom Waits, and Nick Cave are of equal importance to Churchwood's sound.  Much like his published poetry, Doerr's lyrics reflect an interest in French Symbolism, Literary Modernism, Surrealism, and Beat Poetry.  His themes are largely existentialist in scope: absurdity, anxiety, alienation, passion, individuality, and authenticity are his primary concerns.\n\n\n== History ==\nChurchwood formed in 2007 in Austin, Texas and signed with San Antonio's Saustex Records in 2010.  The band released six LPs on the Saustex label: Churchwood (2011), Churchwood 2 (2013), 3: Trickgnosis (2014), Hex City, (2016)  Plenty Wrong to Go Awry (2020), and The Boule Oui (2022).  Two additional records by Churchwood, an EP titled Just the Two of Us (2012), and a 2-track single of cover songs by Evan Johns titled Johns 2:22 (2023) also appear courtesy of Saustex.\nIn 2011, Churchwood placed their song \"Rimbaud Diddley\" on Season 4, Episode 4 (\"Una Venta\") of AMC's Sons of Anarchy.\nIn 2016, original drummer Julien Peterson left the band to pursue other interests; he was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Eric Bohlke of Austin's Khali Haat in the spring of 2017.\nBohlke appears as Churchwood's drummer on three recordings: Plenty Wrong to Go Awry,  The Boule Oui, and  Johns 2:22.  Bohlke further lent his talents to Churchwood by recording and mixing the latter two of the above-mentioned records in his home sound studio in Austin.\nChurchwood's future became uncertain if not imminently foreshortened when guitarist and founder Bill Anderson announced that he was moving from Austin to New Mexico in the spring of 2021.\nSaustex Records billed a show at Austin's Sagebrush on November 11, 2023 as Churchwood's \"Last Sermon.\"\nHowever, an article by the late Michael Corcoran in March 2024 has Churchwood currently on hiatus\" and teasing a possible return with an album of unreleased songs by Ballad Shambles, a 1980s project that featured the earliest incarnation of the Anderson-Doerr songwriting partnership.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nChurchwood (Saustex, 2011)\nJust the Two of Us (Saustex, 2012)\nSample This: Saustex 2012 Sampler (Saustex, 2012)\n2 (Saustex, 2013)\nThe Saustex Variations (Saustex, 2014)\n3: Trickgnosis (Saustex, 2014)\nHex City (Saustex, 2016)\nPlenty Wrong To Go Awry (Saustex, 2020)\nThe Boule Oui (Saustex, 2022)\nJohns 2:22 (Saustex, 2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChurchwood at All Music\nChurchwood at Saustex Media\nChurchwood at Reverb Nation\nChurchwood \"I Have a Devil in Me\"\nChurchwood \"Duende (Live at The Hole in the Wall)\""

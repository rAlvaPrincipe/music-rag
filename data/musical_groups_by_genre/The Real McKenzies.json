    "text": "The Real McKenzies is a Canadian Celtic punk band founded in 1992 and based in Vancouver, British Columbia. They are considered the founders of the Canadian Celtic punk movement, and were one of the first Celtic punk bands, albeit 10 years after The Pogues. Founding member Paul McKenzie has been the only continuous member of the band since its inception.\nIn addition to writing and performing original music, Real McKenzies perform traditional Scottish songs, giving them a new punk-influenced sound. The band has shared stages with several other bands and artists, including Rancid, Shane MacGowan, NOFX, Flogging Molly, The Misfits, Metallica, the Specials, and Voodoo Glow Skulls.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band released their debut album, \"the Real McKenzies\" in 1995, a cheeky collection of short punky originals, interspersed among celtic classics, & deeply tongue-in-cheek, punk-infused covers like \"My Bonny\", \"Pliers\" (Jimi Hendrix's \"Fire\"), \"Kilt\" (Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias's \"Kill\"), and \"Outta Scotch\" (the Pointed Sticks's \"Outta Luck\"). \nTheir 1998 follow up Clash of the Tartans popularized Scottish-Canadian punk-rock, with solid singles \"Thistle Boy\", \"Pagan Holiday\", \"Mainland\", \"Kings O' Glasgow\", & the old celtic classic \"Wild Mountain Thyme\". Frontman Paul McKenzie claims as many as 100 different musicians have performed as members of the band, including (now-deceased) bassist Rich \"Rock\" Priske (Matthew Good Band, Bif Naked; drummer Glenn \"McKruger\" Kruger (Bloody Chicletts, the Paperboys, Mudgirl, Carly Rae Jepsen); & piper Alan \"Raven\" MacLeod, of the pioneering '70s Scottish folk band The Tannahill Weavers, and 90s duo Bourne and MacLeod. In 2012, they delved deeper into covering songs from popular Canadian singer-songwriter Stan Rogers with their version of \"Barrett's Privateers\" appearing on their album Westwinds.\nMcKenzie said in 2014 that he \"fired all the Americans\" in the band, and returned to a full Canadian lineup. Despite that claim, Aspy Luison is from Cambre, Galicia, Spain.\nIn September 2014 the band announced they would be recording their next album for Fat Wreck Chords at Motor Studio in San Francisco. Michael \"Fat Mike\" Burkett will be producing the album.\nOn April 7, 2015, Fat Wreck Chords released The Real McKenzies' 11th album, Rats in the Burlap.\nThe band covered Stan Rogers a second time for their 2017 album Two Devils Will Talk with the song \"Northwest Passage\".\nOn March 10, 2022, it was announced that former War Baby drummer Kirby J. Fisher had joined the band.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nTheir song \"Tae the Battle\" appeared in the 2008 British-Canadian film Stone of Destiny.\nTheir song \"Wild Cattieyote\" appeared in the 2004 straight-to-video release of Vampires vs. Zombies (also called Carmilla the Lesbian Vampire).\nTheir cover of the Turbonegro song \"Sailor Man\" appeared in the 2003 video game Tony Hawk's Underground and the first volume of the Elementality skateboarding videos. Each year, The Real McKenzies version of \"Auld Lang Syne\" is used as the countdown music on the New Year's Eve edition of Kevin Smith and Ralph Garman's live podcast Hollywood Babble-On.\nTheir song \"Chip\" was used in the TV series Billions in 2018.\nAlso, in 2018, Paul McKenzie contributed vocals to the song 'Foreman O'Rourke' by Sydney, Australia's The Rumjacks\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\nReal McKenzies, 1995\nClash of the Tartans, 1998\nFat Club 7\", 2000\nLoch'd and Loaded, 2001\nPissed tae th' Gills, 2002\nOot & Aboot, 2003\n10,000 Shots, 2005\nOff the Leash, 2008\nShine Not Burn, 2010\nWestwinds, 2012\nRats in the Burlap, 2015\nTwo Devils Will Talk, 2017\nBeer and Loathing, 2020\nSongs of the Highlands, Songs of the Sea, 2022\n\n\n=== Filmography ===\nPissed tae th' Gills, 2002\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nShort Music for Short People, 1999\nAlpha Motherfuckers - A Tribute to Turbonegro, 2001\nAgropop Now, 2003\nFloyd:..And Out Come the Teeth, a free Fat Wreck Chords compilation CD handed out at the label's tent during Warped Tour 2001\nShot Spots - Trooper Tribute (Visionary Records)\nLive from Europe, Deconstruction Tour, 2003 - DVD\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\"Mainland\" (1998)\n\"Drink Some More\" (2008)\n\"Chip\" (Live) (2008)\n\"The Maple Trees Remember\" (2009)\n\"Culling the Herd\" (2011)\n\"My Luck Is So Bad\" (2012)\n\"Catch Me\" (2015)\n\"Stephen's Green\" (2015)\n\"Yes\" (2015)\n\"Due West\" (2017)\n\"Seafarers\" (2017)\n\"One Day\" (2018)\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bands from Canada\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

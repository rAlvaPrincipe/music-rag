    "text": "Murder, Inc. was an American industrial music supergroup formed in 1991, featuring vocalist Chris Connelly, Killing Joke members Geordie Walker, Paul Raven, \"Big Paul\" Ferguson, John Bechdel, and former Public Image Ltd drummer Martin Atkins.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nMartin Atkins joined Killing Joke as their drummer and later their manager in 1990. The band recorded the 1990 album Extremities, Dirt and Various Repressed Emotions after which they parted ways with singer Jaz Coleman. Keeping the line-up of Killing Joke (minus Coleman) together, Atkins formed Murder, Inc., recruiting Chris Connelly (who had worked with Ministry amongst others) to replace Coleman and former Killing Joke member Paul Ferguson as a second drummer.\nThe band released their debut EP, Corpuscle, which featured tracks remixed by J. G. Thirlwell, in 1991 followed by their eponymous album in 1992. The album was recorded by Steve Albini who had already worked with Atkins on the Pigface album Gub and with Connelly on his album Whiplash Boychild. The band played five live dates before disbanding later in 1992, due to \"internal squabbles\".\nIn 1998 Connelly, Atkins, and Walker reconvened and formed another industrial supergroup with Jah Wobble called The Damage Manual.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMartin Atkins – drums\nJohn Bechdel – keyboards\nChris Connelly – vocals\nPaul Ferguson – drums\nPaul Raven – bass\nGeordie Walker – guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\nCorpuscle (EP, 1992)\nMurder, Inc.

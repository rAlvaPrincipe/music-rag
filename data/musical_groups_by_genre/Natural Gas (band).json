They had hit that year with \"All Powerful Man\". Their self-titled album also made the charts.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn a similar vein to Lighthouse, Chicago and Blood Sweat & Tears, the group was put together by George Olliver. The group's line up included drummer Graham Lear, and George Olliver. Founder Olliver had previously been with Mandala and George Olliver & The Soul Children which was formed in 1967. Other members were, Dave “Hulk” Berman,  Dave Classic,  Leon Feigenbaum,  Dave Tamblyn,  Carl Watral and Brian Wray.

Playing in genres that ranged from rhythm and blues to jazz and rock, they received a positive review by Montreal's The Gazette. The reviewer noted a slightly unusual choice of material when they played the theme to 2001: A Space Odyssey, but wrote that it added to their versatility.    Also in January, their album was released. It actually saw a US release before it got a Canadian release. The album was a Record World and Billboard frontpage pick.\nIt was reported by Record World in their January 24, 1970, issue that Natural Gas' single  \"All Powerful Man\" bw \"What Do You Want From My Life\" would soon be released. A party was held at Broadway Recording Studios for the release of the group's album.

Their song, \"What Do You Want From My Life\" was also getting attention.\nBy March, 1970, Modern Tape's Promotional Director, John Driscoll was ready to tour the Western Provinces to promote the group's LP album and their single, \"All Powerful Man\".\n\"All Powerful Man\" peaked at #76 on May 9, 1970, spending a total of 7 weeks in the Canadian charts. Their album got into the Canadian Top 10.

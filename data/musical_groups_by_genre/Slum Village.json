    "text": "Slum Village is an American hip hop group from Detroit, Michigan. The group was formerly composed of the rappers Baatin (1974–2009), T3, and rapper / producer J Dilla (1974–2006). J Dilla left in 2001 to pursue a solo career with MCA Records. Elzhi joined in his absence, after which Baatin also left due to health complications. \nFollowing J Dilla's death in 2006 and Baatin's death in 2009, T3 remains the sole surviving member of the original lineup. Over its history the group has been through several line-up changes, which once included J Dilla's younger brother Illa J, but now the group exists as a duo of T3 and producer Young RJ.\n\n\n== Formation and early years ==\nRappers Baatin, T3 and producer J Dilla grew up together in the Conant Gardens neighborhood of Detroit and attended Pershing High School together. Slum Village was founded by Baatin, T3 and J Dilla.\nFrom 1996 to 1997 the group recorded their first album Fantastic (Vol. 1), however it was not officially released until 2006, 9 years after original recording.\nSlum Village signed their first record deal in 1998 with the now defunct Barak/A&M records. Due to internal politics with the label, the group was forced to release their 2000 album Best Kept Secret under the alias \"J-88\". Best Kept Secret featured remixes and leftover material from the heavily boot-legged Fantastic, Vol. 1. That same year Fantastic, Vol. 2 was released on GoodVibe Recordings, which featured appearances from Busta Rhymes, Common, D'Angelo, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Pete Rock, Kurupt, and Q-Tip.\n\n\n== J Dilla era ==\nFresh out of high school, the group steadily became popular in Detroit's underground hip hop scene. However, by the mid-1990s J Dilla was already a well known hip-hop prospect, with a string of singles and remixes to his name, working on projects with Janet Jackson, Pharcyde, De La Soul, Busta Rhymes, and Q-Tip among others. In 1995 he was invited to become a member of a production team known as The Ummah, which produced the fourth and fifth A Tribe Called Quest studio albums, as well as hits for a number of R&B and hip hop musicians. In 1998, Slum Village opened for A Tribe Called Quest, on their farewell tour. In 2001, J Dilla left Slum Village to pursue a solo career.\nJ Dilla died on February 10, 2006, after being diagnosed with TTP and Lupus. In light of his game-changing impact in the world of music production, many high-profile artists mourned and paid tribute to him following his death.\nSlum Village's 2015 album YES! features songs that were produced by Dilla before his 2006 death.\n\n\n== Baatin era ==\nTitus Glover (March 8, 1974 – July 31, 2009), also known as Baatin, was an American rapper who emerged from the mid-1990s underground hip hop scene in Detroit, Michigan part of the rap group Slum Village. Baatin started rapping as a student at Pershing High School in Detroit where he went by the names Scandalous-T, and Eazy-T among others.\nIn the early 1990s Glover adopted the name Baatin. He claimed the name (which is Arabic for 'hidden') was chosen to reflect a newfound spirituality.\nBaatin remained as an active member of the group until the early 2000s. In 2002, shortly after the release of the group's third album, Baatin began to experience health problems, which interfered with the group's music and touring performances. In regard to his health problems, he said:\n\nThe confusion started verbally. I would be angry and lash out and go crazy. I was like: Do I got demons? I couldn't control it. It was a learning experience. They said I have depression, schizophrenia with bipolar tendencies. It was bipolar when I was responding to 12 different impulses. I didn't hurt nobody.\nSuffering from mental illness and a drug problem, Baatin left the group in 2003. He was later diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression.\nBaatin stated that he was \"kicked out while in hospital\", receiving a termination letter, while in the hospital. \nAfter leaving the group, he began recording as a solo artist. During this period, he went by the name \"Baatin the Slumlord.\" In 2008, the dispute was resolved and Baatin reunited with T3 and Elzhi, and worked on the group's sixth album Villa Manifesto.\nBaatin died on July 31, 2009, at the age of 35. He was found in his home on Anglin Street in northeast Detroit. Following a homicide investigation, reports released by the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office, state the cause of his death was cocaine abuse and the manner of death was listed as accidental.\nBaatin was survived by a son, Michael Majesty Ellis, a daughter, Aura Grace Glover, and a sister, Tina, all of Detroit.\nIn 2010, members Baatin and Illa J were featured alongside many former collaborators of J Dilla (such as Black Milk, Phat Kat and M.E.D.) on French producer Cris Prolific's album Art / Money Volume 1 (on the tracks Foundations and Voyage respectively). J Dilla himself was slated to make a vocal appearance on the track Innovators but died before recording.\nIn 2018, a 7-inch posthumous single of Baatin, \"Don't Stop\", was released. A music video for the OG version was released the same day.\n\n\n== Elzhi era ==\nFor the 2002 release \"Trinity (Past, Present and Future)\" on Barak/Capitol Records, T3 brought in Elzhi to join the group as J Dilla left to focus on his solo career. The album was a moderate success and contained the single Tainted, produced by Karriem Riggins and featuring Dwele Also in 2002,'Dirty District, a compilation songs by Detroit rappers largely produced by T3 and Young RJ\"Rice, was released.\nThe group then became a duo consisting T3 and Elzhi, when Baatin became sick while touring in France shortly before the release their 2004 album, Detroit Deli (A Taste of Detroit) and departed to seek treatment. The album included the hit single, \"Selfish\", produced by Kanye West and featuring John Legend. The song samples a part of the intro to the hit song \"Call Me\" by Aretha Franklin. After parting ways with Capitol Records in 2005, they released Prequel to a Classic a mixtape mostly previously unreleased material, followed by Slum Village \"Self-Titled\" release in October the same year.\nIn a 2008 interview, T3 announced that Slum Village had reunited with Baatin and had added Illa J to bring a \"Dilla effect\": cquote|I'm incorporating Baatin, and I'm putting Illa J in — not to take Dilla's place, but just to have that Dilla essence on this new project. I'm pulling together all the producers that we've used before — Young RJ, Waajeed Karriem Riggins, Pete Rock and all the people who have been down with SV from day one. Villa Manifesto was released under Koch Records on July 27, 2010, featuring Baatin.\nIn July 2010, Elzhi decided to pursue his solo career and left the group. In recent interviews, T3 stated that he had not talked to Elzhi since he departed the group.\nSlum Village released YESon June 16, 2015, an album made with unused J Dilla beats, produced mostly by \"Young RJRice.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Appearances ===\n2000: \"One-4-Teen (Funky For You)\" (from the Bahamadia album BB Queen)\n2000: \"Thelonius\" (from the Common album Like Water for Chocolate)\n2001: \"LTAH\" (from the Hi-Tek album Hi-Teknology)\n2003: \"Wolves\" (from the Phat Kat album The Undeniable LP)\n2004: \"Da Villa\" (from the Pete Rock album Soul Survivor II)\n2004: \"Aerodynamic (Slum Village Remix)\" (from the Daft Punk Album Daft Club)\n2005: \"Keep On\" (from the Dwele album Some Kinda...)\n2006: \"Time Has Come\" (from the Exile album Dirty Science)\n2007: \"Cuz I'm Jazzy\" (from the Guru album Jazzmatazz, Vol. 4)\n2007: \"Action\" (from the Black Milk album Popular Demand)\n2007: \"Gangsta Boogie\" (from the Pete Rock album NY's Finest)\n2007: \"Got Me Goin' (Hip Hop)\" (from the Statik Selektah album Spell My Name Right: The Album)\n2008: \"Brandy\" (from the Dwele album Sketches of a Man)\n2008: \"To Be Determined\" (from the Evidence album The Layover EP)\n2008: \"Get Live\" (from the DJ Wich album The Golden Touch)\n2010: \"How I Deal\" (from the Dwele album  W.ants W.orld W.omen)\n2010: \"We Do It\" (from the KVBeats album  The Résumé)\n2013: \"Cash Flow\" (by Havoc)\n2013: \"En su propia trampa\" (Canal 13 Chile)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nSlum Village Video Interview at dropmagazine.com\nSlum Village Interview at HipHopGame.com\nBaatin obituary at HHC Digital\nHiphopdx.com\nT-3 Interview with HHLO.net (Hip Hop Lives Online)"

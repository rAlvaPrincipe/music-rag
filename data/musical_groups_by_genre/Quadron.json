    "text": "Quadron is a Los Angeles–based Danish duo consisting of singer Coco O. and musician/producer Robin Hannibal. The group considers their genre \"electronic soul music\".\nThe self-titled debut album Quadron was released in late July 2009. Paste Magazine named Quadron \"Best of What's Next\" in August 2010, and New York Magazine named Quadron's self-titled album number 7 in their top 10 best albums of the year. The duo released their second studio album Avalanche in 2013.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2009, Hannibal and Coco O. of electronica collective Boom Clap Bachelors formed the group Quadron. The name of the band refers to the multi-racial heritage of the band members (from the term \"quadroon\"). Both Hannibal and Coco O. have one biracial parent.\nQuadron's first professional project, released 2009, was a collection of seven songs on the soundtrack for the Hella Joof movie, Hush Little Baby including the film's theme song \"Slippin'\". Their music gained wider prominence in the United States due to Hannibal's connections to US-based music industry professionals. They re-located to Los Angeles in 2010.\nThe duo released their eponymous debut album under Plug Research in 2010. Their second album, Avalanche, was released in June 2013.\nIn 2011, Quadron contributed the track \"Samba De Verão\" to the Red Hot Organizations charitable album Red Hot+Rio 2. The album is a follow-up to the 1996 Red Hot + Rio. Proceeds from the sales were donated to raise awareness and money to fight HIV/AIDS and related health and social issues. That year they also collaborated with American DJ and record producer Kaskade for the song \"Waste Love\" off his album Fire & Ice.\nIn 2014 Quadron was booked as the opening act on Mayer Hawthorne's U.S. tour.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nRobin Hannibal is one-half of the duo Rhye, along with Canadian musician Michael Milosh. After releasing two tracks, they released their first album Woman on 4 March 2013.\n\nCecilie Maja Hastrup Karshø (known professionally as \"Coco O.\") was a member of the Boom Clap Bachelors prior to joining Quadron.

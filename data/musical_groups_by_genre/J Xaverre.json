    "text": "Founded in 2000, J Xaverre is an English folktronica artist from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, England. Largely a solo creation by Pete Gofton, he has occasionally been joined by Lea Doherty (vocals) and the King of Woolworths member Jon Brooks (keyboards and production).\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 2000, J Xaveere is one of many aliases for the Sunderland-based multi-instrumentalist and producer Pete Gofton.\nAfter his previous band Kenickie split in 1998, he got a solo publishing deal with Universal Records. He purchased some recording equipment, and began the first incarnation of his studio, Wang Computers. He produced bands such as Spraydog and Woodchuck, and the recordings of his ex-Kenickie bandmate (and sibling) Lauren Laverne.\nHe released his first single, a vinyl only seven inch, \"Wild Weekend\" / \"Nilsong\", in 2000, on Odeam, his flatmate's label. He then released two EPs (Bingo Wings and Skaterdater) in 2001 and 2002 on Moshi Moshi Records. The former attained single of the week status in the NME.\nHe signed to the Memphis Industries label, releasing several singles and an album, These Acid Stars, in 2003.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nIt's All True (2002)\nThese Acid Stars (2003)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n\"Wild Weekend\" / \"Nilsong\" (2000)\nBingo Wings EP (2001)\nSkaterdater EP (2002)\n\"Saturday\" (2003)\n\"Great All Great\" (2003)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nWe Love You...So Love Us Too (Wild Weekend) (2001)\nBeikoku Ongaku/Bambini Records (Saturday) (2002)\nEstuary English (Saturday) (2003)\nWe Got Monkeys; 5 Years Of Moshi Moshi Records (Bingo Wings) (2004)\nThe Memphis Family Album (Bingo Wings) (2006)\n\n\n== External links ==\nJ Xaverre's official website"

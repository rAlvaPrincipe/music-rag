    "text": "Cannons are an American indie pop band formed in 2013 in Los Angeles. The band consists of lead vocalist Michelle Joy, lead guitarist Ryan Clapham, and keyboardist and bass guitarist Paul Davis.\n\n\n== History ==\nRyan Clapham and Paul Davis, who have been friends since childhood, began composing music together in their teenage years. In 2013, Clapham and Davis formed Cannons with Michelle Joy after meeting her through the website Craigslist, where she had posted an advertisement seeking a band in need of a vocalist. The trio collaborated on early Cannons material over the Internet, with Clapham and Davis emailing musical tracks to Joy, who would then email back her own lyrical and vocal contributions.\nCannons issued their first EP Up All Night in 2014. The band then released their debut album Night Drive in 2017, as well as a second EP, In a Heartbeat, the following year. Shadows, Cannons' second album, was released in 2019 by AntiFragile Music. \"Fire for You\", the first single from Shadows, gained significant commercial traction after being featured in a 2020 episode of the comedy-drama TV series Never Have I Ever. The band subsequently signed to Columbia Records. In early 2021, \"Fire for You\" reached number one on the Billboard Alternative Airplay chart. Fever Dream, the band's third album, was released in March 2022.\nAfter teasing their fourth album for some months, and releasing three prior singles from the album, Cannons announced that Heartbeat Highway would be released on November 10, 2023, preceded by a fourth single, \"Crush\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nRyan Clapham – guitar\nPaul Davis – bass, keyboards\nMichelle Joy – vocals\nTouring members\n\nBen Hilzinger – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

    "text": "Groove Collective is an American band. In 2007 they were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album of the Year for the release People People Music Music on the Savoy Jazz label.\n\n\n== Style ==\nGroove Collective was formed in 1990.  The original members were percussionist/MC Gordon \"Nappy G\" Clay, keyboardist Itaal Shur, Vibraphonist Bill Ware, drummer Genji Siraisi, bassist Jonathan Maron, percussionist Chris Theberge, flutist Richard Worth, saxophonist Jay Rodriguez, trumpeter Fabio Morgera, trombonist Josh Roseman.\nAfter witnessing an early show, producer Gary Katz negotiated the band's signing to Reprise Records, and produced their eponymous debut album in 1993.\nIn 1994, they appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation album, Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool, alongside other prominent jazz artists, Herbie Hancock and Roy Ayers.  The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as \"Album of the Year\" by Time magazine.\nThey scored two instrumental and adult contemporary hits in 1996 with a cover of the Beatles' \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" (US Dance/Club Play #45, US Dance Maxi Singles #23) and \"Lift Off\" (US R&B/Hip-Hop #73).\nGroove Collective's musical style reflects the wide-ranging backgrounds and interests of its individual members. Commenting on the group's 1996 release, We the People, critic Michael Casey referred to the numerous influences at work in Groove Collective's sound, specifically the presence of Afro-pop, Latin jazz, hip-hop, and traditional jazz stylings. This mix is born of the members' varying influences, including bebop, funk, old-school hip-hop and classic soul. Bassist and co-founder Jonathan Maron has acknowledged the importance of a DJ aesthetic in the music, stating that \"(Groove Collective's) goal has always been to emulate the range of music a DJ plays during the course of the night at a packed club. ... A great DJ knows the songs that can ignite the room and fill the dance floor. Some of my favorite musical experiences have been in clubs, where you listen and realize how well all of these styles blend together into one big idiom of its own.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\nGroove Collective (Reprise/Giant Step, 1994) U.S. Jazz No. 20\nWe the People (Giant Step, 1996) U.S. Jazz No. 20\nDance of the Drunken Master (Shanachie, 1998) U.S. Jazz No. 22\nDeclassified (Shanachie, 1999)\nIt's All in Your Mind (Shanachie, 2001)\nLive: Brooklyn, NY 04.20.02 (Kufala, 2002)\nLive...and Hard to Find (Kufala, 2002)\nNew York, NY 20.12.02 (Kufala, 2002)\nPeople People Music Music (Savoy, 2005)\nPS1 Warm Up: Brooklyn, NY, 7/2/2005 (Kufala, 2007)\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current lineup ===\nJay Rodriguez – saxophone, flute, vocals\nJonathan Maron – bass\nGenji Siraisi – drums\nChris Ifatoye Theberge – Conga, Bata\nwith\n\nJosh Roseman – trombone\nMarcio Garcia - keyboards\nBryan Vargas - guitar\nNina Creese - percussion and vocals\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nRichard Worth – flute, kalimba, compositions, vocals\nItaal Shur – keyboards, synthesizers, compositions, vocals\nBill Ware – vibraphone, compositions, vocals\nNappy G/Gordon Clay – percussion, talking drum, compositions, vocals\nBarney McAll - Keyboards, toys, samples, compositions\nFabio Morgera- trumpet and flugelhorn, compositions\nDavid Jensen – tenor saxophone\nMike Dillon (musician) - vibraphone\n\n\n== Collaborators ==\nAdam Rogers - guitar\nMark Anthony Jones - guitar\nBryan Vargas - guitar\nSimone Giuliani - keyboards\nUli Geissendorfer - keyboards\nJonathan Crayford - keyboards\nEtienne \"ATN\" Stadjwyck - keyboards\nBernie Worrell - keyboards\nVictor Axlerod - keyboards\nEric Lane - keyboards\nBen Stivers - keyboards\nPablo Vergara - keyboards\nCucho Valdez\nDavid Fiuczynski\nCurtis Fowlkes - trombone\nFred Wesley - trombone\nReut Regev - trombone\nPeter Apfelbaum - saxophones\nTroy Simms - saxophones\nClark Gayton - trombone\nJack Walrath - trumpet\n-\n\nDJ Jazzy Nice - DJ\nWayne \"Smash\" Hunter - DJ\nDJ Nicodemus\nEric Kupper\nSalam Remi\n-\n\nDiosa Gary - vocals\nMC Babee Power - vocals\nVinia Mojica - vocals\nAlien Nation - vocals\nLucy Woodward - vocals\nMalik Work - vocals\n-\n\nHiroyuki Sanada - production and mixology\nUncle Fester - live production\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Oucho Sparks is an American indie rock band based in Chicago, Illinois, United States.\nSince the formation circa the turn of the century, the ensemble has gone through several style and personnel transitions. The consistent thread has been a strong display of musicianship, complex/dense song arrangements, and a DIY work ethic.\n\n\n== About the band ==\nThe name Oucho Sparks is a phonetic play on the name Groucho Marx, an American comedian.\nIn its various incarnations, Oucho Sparks is known for its vocal harmonies, epic guitar lines, icy synths, and lush cinematic soundscapes. They have been compared to other rock bands such as Radiohead, Queen, The Flaming Lips, Frank Zappa, Arcade Fire, and Hawkwind.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\nThe band formed around 1998 as a jazz fusion group with experimental tendencies. The founding members were Ryan Chindlund on drums, Robert Salihar on bass guitar and vocals, and Aaron Allietta on keyboards. Dan Haggerty and Scotty Kattenbraker were soon added as guitarists. The first album From The Blue Light House (1998) showcases this particular incarnation.\nIn the next year, the band had some significant personnel changes as guitarists Haggerty and Kattenbraker left to pursue other artistic ventures. The ensemble added a trumpet and saxophone, Mike Strazzulla and Jason Lavalle respectively. With the addition of horns, the jazz element was emphasized. Salihar remained as the main vocalist though Chindlund would perform the lead vocals on certain songs. The resulting work of this incarnation was the second album Rebirth of the Fool (1999.) The title is a word play on the Miles Davis album titled Birth of the Cool.\nDuring 1999, the band performed several live shows but lost saxophonist Lavalle toward the end of the year. The band continued as a four piece until guitarist Rob Heinz and saxophonist Tim Sandusky joined in late 1999.\n2000 proved to be a major transition for the band as many new members were added. Guitarists David Gallagher and David Bowers replaced guitarist Rob Heinz. Second drummer James Gallagher and trumpeter Matt Topic concurrently joined also. Much of the reason for this increase in personnel was in preparation for Zappening 2000, a festival held in tribute to Frank Zappa. The bill included bands with Zappa band alumni and notable acts with Zappa flavor.\nAfter Zappening 2000 Dave Gallagher, Dave Bowers, James Gallagher, and Matt Topic all became official members as their other project (Dave's Tune) ceased performing.  Soon after, violinist Chris Grant joined, thus making Oucho Sparks a ten-member band. This period produced the most Frank Zappa influenced music.\n\nBy 2001 Oucho Sparks started to emphasize the progressive rock element of their sound. After dropping Mike Strazzulla, Chris Grant, and Matt Topic, the band embarked on recording Silver Daddy (2001.) This album is mostly instrumental and features some of the most advanced instrumental arrangements with sparse vocals by Salihar and Chindlund. Two songs from Silver Daddy (\"Gropus\" and \"Floigan\") appear in the 2002 film Urban Ground Squirrels.\nThroughout 2001 and 2002 The seven member lineup performed several festivals and concerts most notably Camp Buzz and The Blackhawk Farms Festival.\nThe members of Oucho Sparks collectively founded an underground music venue named Cafe Ballistico in 2003. Many now notable Chicago music acts had some of their earliest performances at Cafe Ballistico including Bound Stems, Bang Bang (band), and The Andreas Kapsalis Trio.  The Ballistico concept culminated at the 2004 Ballistico Fest featuring Oucho Sparks and several other Ballistico friendly bands.\n\nExcept for Ballistico Fest, Oucho Sparks as a music project was unseen from 2003-2007. During that period, the band reformed once again and decided to take a more vocal-focused approach. In late 2003 the band started a new recording to help define the musical direction. Laura Grey joined to provide female vocals, while former saxophonist Tim Sandusky took over lead male vocals. In order to properly record this album, Tim Sandusky and cohorts built a recording studio in Chicago now known as Studio Ballistico. The album Foreign Cars and Robots was completed near the end of 2006. This album marked the modern age of Oucho Sparks and supporting shows in 2007 reflect this.\nThe project has been largely inactive since 2009.\n\n\n== Live concerts ==\nThe band throughout its incarnations has been known for its \"over the top\" live shows involving props and theatrics. Currently Oucho Sparks desires theaters and alternative performance spaces for the multimedia show. A live concert was released on the official website in 2009, and free on YouTube.com.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1998 From the Blue Light House\n1999 Rebirth of the Fool\n2001 Silver Daddy\n2001 Live From Earth Vol. 1\n2002 Live From Earth Vol. 2\n2007 Foreign Cars and Robots\n2009 Photographs & Epitaphs [Live]\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nouchosparks.com â€” The official Oucho Sparks website\nOucho Sparks on MySpace\nOucho Sparks on last.fm\nAmplifier Magazine Article Archived 2007-08-09 at the Wayback Machine"

    "text": "Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 (often shorted to 'Thinking Fellers' or 'TFUL282') was an American indie rock band, which was formed in 1986 in San Francisco, California though half of its members are from Iowa. Their albums combine lo-fi noise rock and ambient sounds (referred to as \"Feller filler\") with tightly constructed rock and pop songs. There is a small but fiercely devoted cult following for the band.\nFor the majority of the band's career, Thinking Fellers consisted of multi-instrumentalists Brian Hageman, Mark Davies, Anne Eickelberg, Hugh Swarts, and Jay Paget.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band achieved their greatest critical and commercial success in the mid-1990s, when they signed with the indie rock label Matador Records. It was during this time that Thinking Fellers produced their most prominent albums, Lovelyville, and Strangers from the Universe. They toured the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and the UK in 1994 and made an appearance on the John Peel radio show on the BBC. In 1996 they toured briefly as an opening act for the alternative rock band Live but were not received well by the Live fanbase. Thinking Fellers has been largely dormant since 1996, having toured sporadically and released only one full album, Bob Dinners and Larry Noodles Present Tubby Turdner's Celebrity Avalanche, since.\nElf Power's 1999 album A Dream In Sound featured a cover of Thinking Fellers Union Local 282's song \"Noble Experiment.\"\nIn 2001, author Jonathan Franzen referenced the band in his novel The Corrections. The character Brian, a snobbish fan of \"west coast underground bands,\" listens to the albums of Thinking Fellers while writing the music software that will make him a young millionaire.\nOn January 7, 2011, the All Tomorrow's Parties festival announced a Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 performance at the ATP festival weekend May 13–15, 2011 curated by Animal Collective.\nIn 2017, Beverly Williams's book Survival Kit's Apocalypse quoted the lines \"If the sadness of life makes you tired/And the failures of man make you sigh/You can look to the time soon arriving/When this noble experiment winds down and calls it a day\" from the Fellers' song \"Noble Experiment\" from Strangers from the Universe. In 2019, The National interpolated those same lines in their song \"Not in Kansas\" on the album I Am Easy to Find.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nWormed by Leonard Thwart Productions 1988 / 1995\nTangle Thwart Productions 1989 / Scratch Records 1995\nLovelyville Matador Records 1991\nMother of All Saints Matador Records 1992\nStrangers from the Universe Matador Records 1994 / Bulbous Monocle 2022\nI Hope It Lands Communion 1996\nBob Dinners and Larry Noodles Present Tubby Turdner's Celebrity Avalanche Communion 2001\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nThe Natural Finger 7\" Ajax Records 1990\n2×4's / Horrible Hour 7\" Nuf Sed 1990\nOuthouse of the Pryeeeeeeee / Wheat Delusion 7\" split w/ Sun City Girls Nuf Sed 1991\nWhere's Officer Tuba 12\" Hemiola Records 1993\nAdmonishing the Bishops Matador Records 1993 / Bulbous Monocle 2022\nThe Funeral Pudding Ajax Records / Brinkman Records 1994\nEveryday / Selections From A Fistful of Dollars 7\" Amarillo Records / Runt 1995\nThe Kids Are In the Mud / Broken Bones 7\" Japan Overseas 1996\n\n\n=== Compilation and Live albums ===\nTFUL282 Japan Overseas 1995\nPorcelain Entertainments Return to Sender 1995 / Fruit Tree 2000\nThese Things Remain Unassigned (Singles, Compilation Tracks, Rarities & Unreleased Recordings) Bulbous Monocle 2023\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nCommunion Label TFUL282 site\nMatador Records TFUL282 site\nSFWeekly article\nThinking Fellers Union Local 282 discography at MusicBrainz"

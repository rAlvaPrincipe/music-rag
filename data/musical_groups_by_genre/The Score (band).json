    "text": "The Score is an American alternative rock duo formed in New York City in 2011, now based in Los Angeles. The group consists of Eddie Anthony Ramirez (lead vocals, guitar) and Edan Chai Dover (backing vocals, keys, producer). Chris Coombs and Logan Baldwin are touring members for the band. They were signed to Republic Records in 2015 after their song \"Oh My Love\" was featured in an advertising campaign for Asda supermarkets. They are currently signed to Imperial Records.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2011–2013: Early years ===\nEddie Anthony and Edan Chai Dover formed the group in 2011, previously working together as a songwriting duo, and made collaborative demos on SoundCloud. In 2012 the band released two singles, \"Dancing Shoes\" and \"Don't Wanna Wake Up\", on their YouTube channel. They also announced that their debut EP would be released in early 2013.\nIn 2013 the band released a cover of \"Sweet Nothing\" by Calvin Harris on YouTube. They also started making covers every Sunday and released them on YouTube as a free download. These covers were called ScoreSundays. They released their lead single to their debut EP, \"Not Just Another Way\", in early 2013. Not long after the single's release their debut EP was canceled. It is unknown why they did so and what the EP was going to be called. The only thing known was that it was supposed to feature \"Not Just Another Way\", and unreleased demos such as \"Hit List\", \"4 AM\", and \"Almost\".\n\n\n=== 2014–2015: The Score EP, The Score EP 2, Where Do You Run EP, and singles ===\nThe Score released their debut EP, The Score EP, in 2014, which features earlier songs, \"Dancing Shoes\" and \"Don't Wanna Wake Up\". The EP also contained their earlier released covers of \"Say Something\" and \"Holy Grail\" as bonus tracks, as well as new songs, \"Til The Stars Burn Blue\", \"Haunted\", and \"This Beating Heart\" and a ScoreSundays acoustic version of \"Dancing Shoes\". The Score continued to release weekly ScoreSundays throughout the year.\nThe Score announce the release of their second EP, The Score EP 2, in 2015 with the lead single, \"Better Than One\". The rest of their EP included tracks \"Lost You\", \"Fall For Me\", featuring Kate Lynne Logan, \"In The Dark\", \"Real Life\", and a remix of \"Lost You\" with Wavve Pilot.\nThe duo gained recognition in early 2015, when the British supermarket chain Asda used their single \"Oh My Love\" in a major advertising campaign titled \"Save Money, Live Better\". According to Asda, part of the reason why they selected the song was because \"they were unsigned and unknown\". The song's placement in the advertisement helped The Score rise in the public eye, and \"Oh My Love\" reached number 43 on the UK Singles Chart in July 2015. That same year, the track became the most-detected song from an advertisement on Shazam. The song also appeared in the 2015 film Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip. The Score released a single, \"Catching Fire\", shortly after the release of Oh My Love.\nFollowing the success of \"Oh My Love\", The Score signed a record deal with Republic Records.

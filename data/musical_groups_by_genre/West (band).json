    "text": "West. (stylized as WEST.), formerly known as Johnny's West (ジャニーズWEST, Janīzu Uesuto) (stylized Johnny's WEST), is a boy band consisting of seven members formed under the Starto Entertainment talent agency. The members are Daiki Shigeoka, Junta Nakama, Takahiro Hamada, Akito Kiriyama, Tomohiro Kamiyama, Ryusei Fujii, and Nozomu Kotaki. The group's name comes from the fact that it originated within the Starto Entertainment talent agency and that the members are from Kansai, the west region of Japan. They are the first group from Kansai Junior. that has debuted in ten years, the last being Super Eight. They debuted in 2014 with the single \"Eejanaika (ええじゃないか)\".\nThe group changed their name to West. before the 10th anniversary of their debut. Their new name was announced through an online stream on October 18, 2023. A period (.) in the new name is added to \"declare\" that they are (people from) the west (Kansai), and that \"though it's a small dot, it's filled with infinite possibilities\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nCreated based on the official website profile and sorted after birthdays. The member colors are used in costumes, CDs, albums, DVDs jackets, and TV shows.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Debut ===\nAt the 2013-2014 Johnny's Countdown Live held at Tokyo Dome from December 31, 2013, to January 1, 2014, the four members, Daiki Shigeoka, Junta Nakama, Akito Kiriyama, and Nozomu Kotaki announced the group's debut and the debut CD. It was a sudden announcement that the four members got the approval from Johnny Kitagawa, the president of the agency, and decided to announce 30 minutes before the appearance on the stage. Initially, the group's name was supposed to be West 4. However, they later found that having the number \"4\" in their name was inappropriate due to the Japanese superstition that the number was unlucky. Therefore, they changed to the name \"West.\" The four members directly asked Johnny Kitagawa to add three more members, namely, Takahiro Hamada, Tomohiro Kamiyama, and Ryusei Fujii. After getting his approval, West became a seven-member group.\nTheir first leading play, \"Naniwa Samurai Hello TOKYO!! (なにわ侍 ハローTOKYO!!),\" was held at the Nissay Theatre from February 5 to 28, 2014. At the rehearsal on February 5, the first day of the play, Takahiro Hamada, Tomohiro Kamiyama, and Ryusei Fujii joined as new members and announced that seven members would debut as West. It was also revealed that initial four members persuaded Johnny Kitagawa to let the other three join the group. In the performances that followed, the group revealed that the group evolved from having four members to seven members.\nThe debut single, \"Eejanaika (ええじゃないか),\" was released on April 23, 2014.\n\n\n==== Story of Pre-debut ====\nIn an interview with Myōjō (Shueisha) after their debut, they revealed the circumstances until their debut. During the appearance of the play \"ANOTHER,\" in which six members other than Fujii appeared in September 2013, it was informed by the staff of Starto Entertainment that they would debut as seven members, including Hamada, Kamiyama, and Fujii. After that, the members had a meeting about their group's name and debut song, and they thought it would be unveiled at \"Johnny's Count Down Live,\" held on December 31, 2013. However, shortly before the concert, the Starto Entertainment told them that they would appear at the concert as Kansai Johnny's Jr., and then all of them were told that they had no longer appeared.\nAfter the situation changed repeatedly, they were informed that they would actually be at the concert, so they needed to go to Tokyo from Osaka. However, only four members, Shigeoka, Nakama, Kiriyama, and Kotaki, were boarded the Shinkansen. During the meeting in Tokyo, Nakama asked the staff why they were gathered without the other three members, and the staff told that they would debut as a group of four members. They told the other three members about the debut a few hours before the Countdown Concert started. Although they appeared in the concert afterward, the four members were not in the mood to smile at all during the performance. Immediately after, during the Kansai Johnny's Jr. concert held on January 4, 2014, the four members could not even meet the other three members because of the debut, and Nakama stated in the interview, \"It was like hell.\"\nThe four members continued to ask for the debut with the other three members, and they were finally able to debut as a group of seven members. Shigeoka mainly asked about the debut, and several members answered, \"It was Shigeoka. He did not give up from the beginning.\" Regarding this matter, Shigeoka responded, \"I accepted it once when I was told that we would debut with four people, but I could not give up my hope. I desired to include the three members who were not involved initially, but that reason was not enough. I wanted the group to be nationally famous, so I believed that three members were absolutely essential for that.\"\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\nAt the 2013-2014 Johnny's Countdown Live held at Tokyo Dome from December 31, 2013, to January 1, 2014, the four members, Daiki Shigeoka, Junta Nakama, Akito Kiriyama, and Nozomu Kotaki announced the group's debut and the debut CD.\nOn February 5, their first leading play, \"Naniwa Samurai Hello TOKYO!!

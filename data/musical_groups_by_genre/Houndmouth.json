After playing locally in Louisville, Kentucky and Indiana, they performed at the SXSW music festival in March 2012 to promote their homemade self-titled EP. Geoff Travis, the head of Rough Trade was in the audience and offered a contract shortly after.

This led to performances on Letterman, Conan, World Cafe, and several major festivals (ACL, Americana Music Festival, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, and Newport Folk Festival). Spin and Esquire.com named Houndmouth a \"must-see\" band at Lollapalooza, and Garden & Gun said, \"You'd be hard pressed to find a more effortless, well-crafted mix of roots and rock this year than the debut album from this Louisville quartet.\"\n\n\n=== Little Neon Limelight (2015) ===\nThe band's second LP, Little Neon Limelight, was released on March 17, 2015. It includes the single \"Sedona\".

    "text": "Wagakki Band (Japanese: 和楽器バンド, Hepburn: Wagakki Bando) is a Japanese band that combines rock and metal music with wagakki instruments and Shigin poetries.\nTheir early songs were adapted from Vocaloid, with their music videos for the songs \"Tengaku\" (天樂) and \"Senbonzakura\" (千本桜) attracting millions of views online before their first album was released. In 2015, their first album of original material, Yasō Emaki, debuted at number one on the Oricon Albums Chart and won a Japan Record Award. Their fourth album Otonoe (2018) also won a Japan Record Award. Wagakki Band have performed live in Asia, Europe, and the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2012–2013: Conception and early work ===\nShigin singer, Kenshibu dancer and classical pianist Yuko Suzuhana, after having been elected \"Miss Nico Nama\" at the 2011 Niconico Douga Music Festival, officially formed the folk-acoustic band Hanafugetsu (flower-wind-moon) in February 2012 alongside shakuhachi player Daisuke Kaminaga and koto player Kiyoshi Ibukuro, as to play at the same festival the following year. In their concerts they would often be joined by other friend musicians, and so Suzuhana conceived a band that would fuse the traditional and modern sides of Japanese culture, leading to the formation of Wagakki Band.\nIn August 2012 the members of Hanafugetsu met guitarist Shin \"Machiya\" Oumura, who was a notable session musician with a reputation for fast playing. Around this time, Suzuhana also met drummer Akira \"Wasabi\" Sasaki at an event by NicoNico Douga. Previous to Hanafugetsu, Ibukuro and Kaminaga were in a folk punk, visual kei band called Crow X Class with wadaiko player Kurona, who happened to be friend with Wasabi too. These first six members started to perform together around Tokyo and Ibaraki. The band's first song was an adaptation of the Vocaloid song \"Tsuki Kage Mai Ka\" (月・影・舞・華, Moon-Silhouette-Dancing-Flower), featuring Kanade on shamisen and Shirakami Mashiro on bass. A video of the recording of the song was published on Suzuhana's personal Youtube page in November 2012, still released under the name Hanafugetsu, and became immediately viral, remaining to this day one of their most viewed videos.\nBassist Asa, a popular Vocaloid producer and creator of the hit song \"Yoshiwara Lament\", then officially joined the band in 2013. During a gig in a Shibuya bar, the band was approached by shamisen player Beni Ninagawa, with which Hanafugetsu already performed, and she became the final addition to the band. The formation of the eight members new band was officially announced in March 2013. They initially operated under the name Suzuhana Yuko with Wagakki Band, but by early 2014 the name was shortened to simply Wagakki Band. Suzuhana joked that her and Ibukuro wanted to call the band \"Daisuke Kaminaga and his friends\". \n\n\n=== 2013–2014: Early mainstream success ===\nA video for the first song recorded by all eight current members of Wagakki Band, \"Six Trillion Years and Overnight Story\" (六兆年と一夜物語), was released in April 2013. In August of that year they played their first live concert at Nico Nico Music Master 2. The music video for \"Tengaku\" (天樂) was released in October 2013; this video marked the first time guitarist Machiya revealed his face and identity, having him previously performed under his real name, Shin Oumura, only in his alternative-rock band m:a.ture.

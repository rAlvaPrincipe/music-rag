Performances, international tours and recordings with Karl Richter and the Münchener Bach-Orchester made the choir internationally known.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Heinrich-Schütz-Kreis ===\nThe choir was founded after World War II by Wilhelm Kamlah as Heinrich-Schütz-Kreis at the Protestant church St. Markus  in Munich. The group introduced the music of the Protestant Heinrich Schütz to the predominantly Catholic Munich. The choir was later directed by Michael Schneider. In 1951 Karl Richter took over.\n\n\n=== Münchener Bach-Chor ===\nIn 1954 the choir was named Münchener Bach-Chor, and the focus shifted to the regular performance of Johann Sebastian Bach's works.

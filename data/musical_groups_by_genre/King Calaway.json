Dumas, Jervis and Harvey share lead vocals. Dumas is from Gibraltar, Harvey is from Scotland, while the other four are from the United States. Chris Deaton said that 'Calaway' is the name of someone he once worked with: \"Kind of like a Lynyrd Skynyrd story, it's the last name of a person. And then we just threw 'king' on it.\" The band was signed to BBR Music Group's Stoney Creek Records.\nIn January 2019, the band released their debut 5-song self-titled EP. The debut single, \"World For Two\", with its video also premiered prior to the album release. The single reached No. 43 on Hot Country Songs.

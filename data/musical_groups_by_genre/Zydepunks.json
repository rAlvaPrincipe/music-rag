They perform in English, French, Spanish, Yiddish, Portuguese, and German. Their instrumentation includes vocals, violins, accordions, bass guitar, and drums.\nTheir music is released on Nine Mile Records. They have performed at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and throughout the United States. In November, 2009, the band performed as part of The Revival Tour. They have been reviewed by Rolling Stone magazine and USA Today.\nAs of 2012, the band is on hiatus. Frontman Juan Küffner currently leads the Sacramento, California-based Hollow Point Stumblers, which blends musical influences in a manner reminiscent of The Zydepunks.

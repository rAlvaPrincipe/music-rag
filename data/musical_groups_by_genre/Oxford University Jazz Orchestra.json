    "text": "The Oxford University Jazz Orchestra (OUJO) is a jazz orchestra based in the University of Oxford, England. It was founded in 1991.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Oxford University Jazz Orchestra was founded by students in the early 1990s, initially as a word-of-mouth, unauditioned group, later developing into a full-fledged, professional standard big band. Notable alumni from the band include Canadian jazz vocalist Diane Nalini, trumpeter and NYJO musical director Mark Armstrong, London-based trombonist Callum Au, saxophonists Carlos Lopez-Real and Idris Rahman, and ENO conductor Stephen Higgins.\nOUJO has been a multiple-time winner at the BBC Radio 2 National Big Band Competition, and has performed at the Oeuf de Jazz Festival in Le Mans, the OK! Celebrity Ball in London, and the Bull's Head jazz venue in Barnes, west London.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, the band was led by cardiologist and saxophonist Euan Ashley. During his tenure, the band appeared at the Glasgow International Jazz Festival and performed Kenny Wheeler's Sweet Time Suite at St Barnabas Church, Oxford. In 2002, OUJO recorded the live LP Know Where You Are.\nIn 2010, OUJO toured New York City, performing at multiple venues including a performance for the Hudson Union Society at the Russian Tea Room and as part of the \"After Work\" series in Bryant Park.\nIn 2012, the band toured to Canada, performing at the Toronto Downtown Jazz Festival, supporting the Mingus Big Band on the main stage at the Ottawa International Jazz Festival, and playing at the Montreal International Jazz Festival.\nIn 2013, OUJO became an official Oxford University Music Society affiliated ensemble.\nIn 2016, the orchestra travelled to New York City once again. As well as being invited back to the Hudson Union Society, the band also performed at the Cornell Club of New York and at ShapeShifter Lab in Brooklyn on Independence Day.\nIn 2018, OUJO made its first tour to Asia, travelling to Bangkok, Thailand.\n\n\n== Associated ensembles ==\nThe Oxford University Jazz Orchestra was linked with the Oxford University Big Band (OUBB), another jazz orchestra based in Oxford. The group was based on a band formed in 1961 by NYJO founder Bill Ashton.\n\n\n== Present activity ==\nOUJO performs regularly on the Oxford ball circuit, including at the Commemoration balls, having appeared in line-ups with artists such as The Streets, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Natty, and Athlete. The band represents Oxford annually in a Varsity ‘Jazz Off’ match against ensembles from the University of Cambridge and Durham University.\nIn 2015, OUJO performed Duke Ellington's choral composition The Sacred Concerts, in collaboration with Schola Cantorum of Oxford, saxophonist Nigel Hitchcock, and vocalist Tina May, and tap dancer Annette Walker at the Sheldonian Theatre.\nIn 2018, the ensemble performed the European premiere of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra’s Big Band arrangement of John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme at the Sheldonian Theatre. The performance featured OUJO alumnus, Mark Armstrong.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOxford University Jazz Society\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOxford University Jazz Orchestra website"

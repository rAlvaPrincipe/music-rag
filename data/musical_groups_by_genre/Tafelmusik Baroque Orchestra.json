The orchestra plays period instruments appropriate to the era of music, including baroque, classical and romantic eras.\nThe orchestra was founded in 1979 by oboist Kenneth Solway and bassoonist Susan Graves. Violinist Jeanne Lamon served as Music Director from 1981 to 2014. An Artistic Committee composed of three orchestra musicians assumed artistic leadership until the appointment of Italian violinist Elisa Citterio as Music Director in 2017. Lamon held the title of Chief Artistic Advisor until 2015, and continued to perform with the orchestra in a reduced capacity until her death from lung cancer in 2021. Citterio departed in early 2022, returning to her native Italy amidst a global pandemic.

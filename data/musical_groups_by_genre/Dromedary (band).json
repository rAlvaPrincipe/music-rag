    "text": "Dromedary, also known as the Dromedary Quartet, is an American world music band originally based out of Athens, Georgia, but now with members on both coasts. The group formed as a duo consisting of Andrew Reissiger and Rob McMaken playing a variety of instruments from cultures across the globe. The group's most recent album Sticks and Stones features New Orleans-to-Athens transplant Louis Romanos (percussion) and Chris Enghauser (bass).\nInstruments utilized include the Bolivian charango, the Turkish cumbus, the Appalachian dulcimer, mandolin, and guitar.\nThe duo have also been frequent collaborators with North Carolina–based singer-songwriter Jonathan Byrd.  Together they recorded The Sea and The Sky, an album of songs Byrd wrote inspired by a band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nArtifact (2001)\nLive from the Make Believe (2003)\nDromedary Quartet (2006)\nSticks and Stones (2008)\n\n\n=== with Jonathan Byrd ===\nThe Sea and The Sky (2004, Waterbug)\nThis Is The New That (2007, Waterbug)\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBudd Kopman, \"Quartet\", All About Jazz, August 15, 2006\n\"Dromedary Expands to a Quartet and Presents New Album\", World Music Central, August 12, 2006\nMike Joyce, \"Jonathan Byrd & Dromedary - The Sea & the Sky, (Waterbug), Andrew McKnight - Beyond Borders (Falling Mountain)\" (reviews), The Washington Post, February 25, 2005, p.WE08\nLiz Carlisle, \"The Best New Folk of Summer 2004: Part II: The intellectuals\" (CD review), The Harvard Independent, October 7, 2004\nMatt Watroba, \"Jonathan Byrd & Dromedary: forces of nature\", Sing Out!, 48:3, Fall 2004  (link—requires subscription to highbeam.com)\nFrancois Couture, \"Review: Live from the Make Believe, , Allmusic, 2003\nFrancois Couture, \"Review: Artifact, , Allmusic\nMatt Hutchinson, \"We are not the world: Athens duo Dromedary breathes American life into international flavors\", CreativeLoafing.com, October 30, 2003\nDaniel Arizona, \"Splendid reviews: Dromedary - Artifact\", Splendid, January 21, 2002\nCarool Kersten, \"Review: Dromedary - Artifact\", Rambles, January 25, 2003\n\n\n== External links ==\nDromedary Archived 2007-02-08 at the Wayback Machine, official web site\nDromedary at MySpace\nDromedary at Allmusic"

    "text": "The Johannesburg Philharmonic Orchestra (JPO) is Johannesburg's leading Philharmonic Orchestra. The chair of the Board of Directors is Mr Justice Dikgang Moseneke, and the CEO and Artistic Director is Bongani Tembe. Tembe was appointed in 2015. He combines this with his role as Artistic Director of the Kwazulu-Natal Philharmonic Orchestra.\nThe JPO presents four symphony seasons each year at the Linder Auditorium at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. The orchestra has a community engagement programme, which sees it perform at schools in Soweto and other townships in Gauteng. The JPO also supports other music genres, including ballet and opera. One example is the Joburg Ballet's 2018 production of Carmen. \n\n\n== Past achievements and activities ==\nDuring 2000, the JPO utilised its own scant financial resources to present 15 concerts that included three overseas guest conductors as well as world-renowned overseas artists.\nSince its inception, the JPO has presented four symphony seasons every year of symphonic music, mostly with the assistance of corporate sponsorship and individual donations and ticket sales.\nIn 2004, the JPO released an internationally acclaimed, world-premiere recording of the Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Violin Concerto.\nThe JPO commissioned and, in March 2004, performed the world-premiere of 'A Mandela Portrait' in recognition of the 10 years of democracy in South Africa. The work was then recorded and broadcast on 1 December 2004 - World Aids Day - on SABC 2.\nIn addition to its symphony concerts, the JPO has performed:\n'Queen: the Concert'\n'The Joburg Pops'\n'La Traviata' and 'La Bohème' for Opera Africa\n'Carmina Burana' for the German Government's celebration of 10 years of democracy\nFauré's 'Requiem' for RAU.\nIn 2007, the JPO became a full-time orchestra with permanent musicians on yearly contracts.\n2009 saw the JPO perform for the Inauguration of President Zuma at the Union Buildings.\nIn 2009, the JPO was awarded funding for a three-year period by the National Lottery Distribution Trust Fund.\nIn 2009 the JPO provided the recordings for the opening and closing ceremonies for the FIFA Confederations Cup.\nIn 2010 the JPO was asked once again to record for the FIFA World Cup opening and Closing ceremonies.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Johannesburg Philharmonic Orchestra (JPO) was formed in 2000 by members of the disbanded National Symphony Orchestra. From 2000 until 2012 it presented four seasons of concerts per year. On September 1, 2006, Shadrack Bokaba was appointed as Managing Director of the JPO. The following year, its business model was changed fundamentally – with the orchestra moving from operating on an ad-hoc basis to becoming Gauteng's only permanent orchestra.\nThe company depended on funding by the public sector for sixty two (62) percent of its annual income, including from the Department of Arts and Culture and from the Lotteries. Other funding partners were from the private sector, including Anglo-American, JD Group and others. One of the successes during this time was the establishment of the JPO Academy, which focused on the training of talented black African musicians. A four-year intensive orchestral programme was offered in partnership with the WITS School of music with the instrumental training provided by JPO musicians. At the end of 2012 the JPO reached another financial crisis which almost ended in liquidation. Mainly, this was due to the declining income from the public sector. The JPO was placed in business rescue on 23 October 2012. A business rescue plan was presented and approved by creditors on 19 March of the following year. In 2013 still, the orchestra underwent a number of organizational changes and managed to present two seasons. Since then, the orchestra has put measures in place to secure its survival going forward.  Commercial recordings include the first recording of the Violin Concerto by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.\n\n\n== References =="

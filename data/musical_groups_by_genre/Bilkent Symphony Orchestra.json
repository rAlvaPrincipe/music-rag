It was founded in 1993 by Bilkent University. Since 1994 the orchestra is based at the Bilkent Concert Hall. The BSO is UNICEF Turkey Goodwill Ambassador since 2009.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bilkent Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1993 as an original artistic project of Bilkent University.

Saygun had dedicated his two works to Doğramacı who pioneered the foundation of ethnomusicology departments at Turkish conservatoires for which Saygun had asked for many years. Upon this and the establishment of Bilkent University Faculty of Music and Performing Arts which was seen as a promising and encouraging music school by Saygun, he left his estate and works to Bilkent University. Thus, now the university preserves some of Saygun's personal belongings such as his piano and his writing table as well as the original forms of his manuscript notes at the Ahmed Adnan Saygun Music Research and Education Center, where Faculty of Music and Performing Arts students give recitals and chamber concerts year-round.\nFollowing the foundation of BSO in 1993 which consists mainly of academics who teach at the Faculty of Music and Performing Arts, BSO has assumed responsibility to perform and record Saygun's works.

Furthermore, the orchestra's national label BMP (Bilkent Music Production) has supported some soloists to perform Saygun's works and made effort to release the albums which consists of Saygun's works in collaboration with several orchestras such as the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra.\nMoreover, in collaboration with the Turkish Education Foundation (tr: Türk Eğitim Vakfı-TEV),  Ahmed Adnan Saygun Music Research and Education Center has requested to compose an opera focusing on Saygun's life and vision due to his 100th birthday in 2007. The libretto was written by Şefik Kahramankaptan and the opera named Saygun Emre was composed by Yiğit Aydın who is also an academic at Bilkent University.

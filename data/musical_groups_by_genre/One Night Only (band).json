    "text": "One Night Only are a British indie rock band from Helmsley, North Yorkshire, formed in 2003.\n\n\n== History ==\nOne Night Only were formed in summer 2003, consisting initially of Mark Hayton, Daniel \"Pob\" Parkin, Sam \"Gunner\" Ford and Kai Smith. The band did not have a vocalist until George Craig, a friend of Ford's brother, joined in a practice. He was asked to be the vocalist, but insisted on playing guitar as well. Smith then left the band. Contrary to some reports, they did not start out as a Beatles cover band — they initially played songs by bands such as Blink-182, New Found Glory and The Beatles, as well as some of their own material.\nThe name, One Night Only, came about when they were asked to play a gig. They did not have a name at the time and so came up with One Night Only, intending the title to, literally, last for only one night, but the name stuck. They performed their first gig on 12 December 2003 in Kirkbymoorside Memorial Hall, which became a popular venue in their early days. In 2005, the keyboard player Jack \"Fish\" Sails joined the band. The band has appeared on The Friday Night Project, performing their third single \"It's About Time\". George Craig also appeared in Hollyoaks, performing an acoustic version of the same song.\nIn 2007, the band toured with Milburn and The Pigeon Detectives. Their first headline tour started in January 2008, ending in March. Their biggest headline tour to date took place in Autumn 2008. They have also played at festivals, including Isle of Wight, Oxegen and Glastonbury. Another tour, supported by the Northern Irish rock trio General Fiasco, Onlookers and other bands, at venues such as the Lincoln Engine Shed and The Astoria.\n\n\n=== Started a Fire (2007–2008) ===\nTheir first album, Started a Fire, was recorded at RAK Studios in St John's Wood, London from August to September 2007. The album was produced by Steve Lillywhite, known for his work with U2. \"You and Me\" was their first single, released in October 2007. It failed to enter the Top 40 of the UK chart however, peaking at No. 46. \"Just For Tonight\", the second single to be released from their album, achieved better success, reaching No. 9 in the UK Singles Chart. The single was released on 28 January 2008, with the album being released a week later on 4 February 2008. \"It's About Time\", the third single, was released on 28 April 2008. It failed to reach the success of \"Just For Tonight\", peaking at No. 37 in the chart. On 7 July 2008, a fourth single, a re-release of \"You And Me\", was released, charting at No. 1 for five weeks in the UK Indie Chart.\n\n\n=== One Night Only (2008–2010) ===\nThe band are said to have written over 25 new songs since releasing Started a Fire. Originally due to be released in the summer of 2009, the album was finally released in late August 2010. It was originally intended to include new songs such as \"Intention Confidential\", \"A Thousand Dreams\" and \"Daydream\" which were performed on their tour in October as well as \"Live It Up\" and \"Hurricane\" which had clips shown in a web video uploaded by them. None of these songs made the final track list, although \"Daydream\" and \"Hurricane\" were recorded as a B-side and an iTunes bonus track, respectively.\nOn 19 March 2010, the band's email newsletter and MySpace announced that recording of their second album was finished. The band also announced the departure of the drummer, Sam Ford. George Craig's brother, James Craig, formerly of Joe Lean and the Jing Jang Jong, was named as the band's new drummer in the same newsletter.\nThe band also performed new songs from their new album during their 2010 Austin, Texas, tour at the SXSW festival. Six new songs made appeared: \"Chemistry\", \"Anything\", \"Forget My Name\", \"Say You Don't Want It\", \"Got It All Wrong\" and \"All I Want\". On 12 May 2010, the band made an ONO Wednesday about their second album photo shoot.\nThe first single taken from the new album was \"Say You Don't Want It\" which was released on 16 August.

They are best known for their single \"Turn Around\", which became an international hit in 1999.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\nPhats & Small appeared on the scene in 1998 with \"Turn Around\", a track that featured sampled Toney Lee's \"Reach Up\" and Change's \"The Glow of Love\". The song debuted at number three in the UK Singles Chart, before climbing to number two, with career sales of this hit amassing them £5,000 in total due to their recording contract.

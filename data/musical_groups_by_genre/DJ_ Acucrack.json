    "text": "DJ? Acucrack is an electronic music duo based in Chicago, Illinois. DJ? Acucrack was formed by Jason Novak and Jamie Duffy as an Acumen Nation drum n' bass side project. The duo initially created the side project to \"kill time\" between releases for Acumen Nation, but their releases as Acucrack were so well received that the side project ended up taking precedence. Their first two releases — Nation State and Mutants of Sound — appeared on the CMJ RPM year end charts for 1998.\nTheir 2000 album, Sorted, peaked at #2 on the CMJ RPM Charts in the U.S. In 2004, DJ? Acucrack opened for KMFDM on their 20th Anniversary Tour.\nIn August 2005, DJ? Acucrack released a new album, Killing Mobius. In 2006, they toured with Front Line Assembly for their Artificial Soldier tour, which was cut short.  Issues with the tour bus company have been cited for the cancellation.\nFounding member Jamie Duffy died on June 21, 2012.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nNation State EP (1997)\nMutants of Sound (1998)\nThe Mutants Are Coming and I Believe They Are of Sound (2000)\nSorted (2000)\nSo to Speak (2000)\nThe Dope King (2002)\nMako Vs.

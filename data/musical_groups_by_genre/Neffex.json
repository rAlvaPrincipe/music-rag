    "text": "Neffex (stylized as in all caps) is an American music project by Bryce Savage and, until 2021, Cameron Wales. They produced remixes and original songs characterized by a mixture of electronic and rap genres. While still a duo, Savage wrote the lyrics, produced the tracks, and sang the songs while Wales mixed and mastered them. They have released most of their songs royalty-free (under CC BY license) which have featured in media by content creators globally.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nBryce Savage (born Brandon Christopher Horth) and Cameron Wales first met in high school when they were 15 years old. At that time, they were involved in a punk rock band. Thereafter, both exited the band and started making their own music. However, this was not yet the creation of NEFFEX. After high school, Wales moved to Los Angeles, but kept in touch with Savage during college. When Savage was in the last year of college, he talked to Wales and they noticed both were making music in their free time. After college, they got together again, in Orange County, and created the name \"NEFFEX\" and the fox symbol. On his YouTube channel Savage exclaimed that the fox symbol was not the original intention; instead, he wanted to make something that was easy to replicate (similar to the infamous \"cool S\" style), and thus it consists of three triangles.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\nIn 2017, the duo set up a challenge to release 100 songs in 100 weeks. All songs released for this challenge are royalty-free and resulted in a combined 2+ billion independent streams across platforms.\nOn October 16, 2019, they released their first EP titled Q203, named after the apartment where they recorded their first songs. The album has six songs: When I Was Young, Without You, It's My Life, Sunday, Primal, and Want Me. Shortly after, they embarked on their first tour, doing 13 cities across Europe throughout October/November of 2019.\nOn September 25, 2020, they released their debut album titled \"New Beginnings\" featuring ROZES, Jez Dior, and MASN. The album has 16 songs: Sometimes, Be Somebody, New Beginnings, Scars, I've Been Let Down, Hell Won't Take Me, I want to Play A Game, Don't Hate Me, Mind Reader, Unavailable, When It Flows, WOW!, Worst of You, Closer to Heaven, Space, and I'll Be Fine.\nOn July 6, 2021, they mutually decided to part ways as Wales wanted to focus on a solo project, while Savage would continue with NEFFEX.\nOn July 7, 2021, Savage set up a challenge to release 100 songs in 100 weeks again and same as before, all songs released for this challenge are royalty-free.\nOn January 13, 2023, NEFFEX's single \"Fight Back\" was certified RIAA Gold. \nOn March 24, 2023, Bryce Savage released the tour dates for his \"Born a Rockstar\" tour spanning 25 cities across Europe and North America. The tour took place between September and December of 2023, with every single location being sold out by the end.\nOn June 1, 2023, NEFFEX's single \"Rumors\" was certified RIAA Gold.\nSavage concluded his latest version of \"100 songs in 100 weeks\" of copyright-free singles on June 8, 2023; however, he has still released songs consistently since.  \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

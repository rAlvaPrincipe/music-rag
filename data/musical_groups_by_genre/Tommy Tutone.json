    "text": "Tommy Tutone is an American power pop band, known for its 1981 song \"867-5309/Jenny\", which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. The band's lead singer, rhythm guitarist, and occasional keyboardist is Tommy Heath. He is the only active original member currently touring as Tommy Tutone. Heath grew up in Philadelphia, Texas, and Montana before moving to San Francisco during the Summer of Love to become a hippie. There, he formed the band with Jim Keller and Terry Nails in 1978, naming it after his nickname. The band's first single, \"Angel Say No\", was released in 1980 and reached the top 40, and they opened for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on his US tour for Damn the Torpedoes. \nThe band's second album, Tommy Tutone 2, was released in 1981 and featured \"867-5309/Jenny\". The song became so popular that people in the United States still prank call the number and ask for Jenny today. In 2006, VH1 named it the 36th-greatest song of the 1980s. \nAs of January 2024, Heath is living in Portland, Oregon, and back touring as Tommy Tutone. A new studio album is set to release in fall 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nTommy Heath and Jim Keller founded the band in 1978 along with bassist Terry Nails (Steve Jones, Ozzy Osbourne), with Heath acting as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, also playing keyboards on occasion. Keller played lead guitar and Terry Nails played bass and provided supporting vocals. Heath and Keller were the only constant members of Tommy Tutone, with the lineup featured a rotating membership of bassists and drummers.  \nBassist Jon Lyons, who performed on \"867-5309/Jenny\", replaced founding member Terry Nails, but was soon himself replaced by Greg Sutton, Pete Costello, and in 1988 Jimmy James. Mona Gnader, the bassist in Sammy Hagar's The Waboritas band, played with the band as well. Original drummer Kenny Johnson (of Chris Isaak's band) was replaced by Mickey Shine (Clover and the first Elvis Costello album), then Victor Carberry for the band's second album, and later Jerry Angel. John Cowsill of The Cowsills played percussion (and sang) on \"867-5309/Jenny\".  \nFrom 2001 to 2010, the band consisted of Heath, Jimmy James, guitarist Greg Georgeson, and drummer Andy Gauthier. In 2007, the band signed a recording contract with Spectra Records. By 2012, Tommy Heath had become a computer analyst and software engineer and moved to Portland, Oregon.  \nIn 2017, with the addition of Steve Fister (Steppenwolf, Lita Ford) on guitar, Jimmy James switched to drums and the band released the single \"My Little Red Book\".\nJim Keller went on to become the director of Philip Glass's publishing company, Dunvagen Music Publishers. He still performs in New York City.\nIn 2019, the band released their first studio album since 1998, Beautiful Ending.\nIn 2024, the band is reunited and touring. A new studio album will be released in the fall entitled New Wave Americana. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Tommy Tutone page\nOfficial Tommy Tutone Instagram\nOfficial Tutone Facebook page\nInterview 2014: Rocker Magazine \"Tommy Tutone: More Than A Number\""

    "text": "Stolen Babies is an American experimental rock band consisting of vocalist/accordionist Dominique Lenore Persi, bassist/guitarist Rani Sharone, and drummer Gil Sharone.\n\n\n== History ==\nStolen Babies formed from a 12+ member high school performance troupe named The Fratellis; the band takes its name from one of the skits performed by the group during this period (written by Dominique Persi and her older brother, animator Raymond S. Persi). Stolen Babies released their first demo CD through their own label, No Comment Records.\n\nAmong the band's many musical influences are groups such as Oingo Boingo, Mr. Bungle, Cop Shoot Cop, and Fishbone (with whom Gil Sharone has performed). Stolen Babies are known for their unclassifiable odd rock and heavy, energetic performances. Except for the earliest demo, each album has featured artwork by indie comic artist Crab Scrambly.\nThere Be Squabbles Ahead, the band's debut full-length album (featuring remixed versions of \"A Year of Judges\" and \"Push Button\" from the 2004 demo), was released early in 2006 through the band's website, but was re-released on October 3 through The End Records. This album was produced by Dan Rathbun, member of the similarly \"avant garde\" experimental rock group Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, who also provides instrumentation on track 7 (tuba) as well as various background vocals on tracks 3, 7, and 12. Carla Kihlstedt (from Sleepytime Gorilla Museum) also contributed violin on tracks 7 and 11. The re-release also featured a music video for the song \"Push Button\" directed by Erik Tillmans. This album also marked the departure of Davin Givhan, the band's former guitarist. Guitarist George Earth, formerly of Switchblade Symphony, took Givhan's place during the international tour that followed.\nThey supported Lacuna Coil alongside Within Temptation and The Gathering on their The Hottest Chicks in Metal Tour 2007 featuring female-fronted metal bands.\nAccording to an interview with Vampire Freaks their new album titled \"Naught\" was released October 16, 2012. From September 4 to 24, the band participated in the Epic Kings & Idols tour, supporting Devin Townsend, Katatonia, and Paradise Lost. They also participated in the \"With a Vengeance\" tour, in support of Otep, alongside New Years Day and Lydia Can't Breathe. The tour began on September 20, 2013 in Fresno, California, and ended on November 9 in Los Angeles, California.\nOn July 3, 2020, Stolen Babies released the single \"Stolen Babies\" on Bandcamp. It was their first new song released in eight years. \nOn October 30, 2021 they released a cover of the theme song to the stop-motion animated film Mad Monster Party? on Bandcamp.\n\n\n== Line-up ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nDominique Lenore Persi – lead vocals, accordion\nRani Sharone – bass, guitar, upright bass, backing vocals\nGil Sharone – drums, percussion\nBen Rico – keyboards, percussion, backing vocals\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nDavin Givhan – guitar\nDarling Freakhead – guitar\nArleena DeLaCruz- drummer\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2002: Stolen Babies EP\n2004: 4-song demo (out of print)\n2006: There Be Squabbles Ahead\n2012: Naught\n\n\n== Side projects ==\nDominique Lenore Persi has played with indie pop-folk polka artist Horace Weintraub, and has lent her accordion-playing skills to many of his recordings.\nGil Sharone was a replacement drummer for +44 on their tours of Europe, Australia and Japan in early 2007.\nDominique Lenore Persi and Rani Sharone are participants in the Immersion Composition Society.

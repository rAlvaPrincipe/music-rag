    "text": "Electro Spectre is a Norwegian electronic music duo from Oslo, Norway. The band consists of Isak Rypdal (writer-producer) and Alexander Bj√∂rneboe (writer-singer).\nTheir debut album Watch It All Turn was initially released in June 2009. The album was later reproduced and re-released in 2010. \nIn September 2012 the band released their second studio album entitled: Dangerous Game. The album was followed by a tour early 2013.\n\n\n== Watch It All Turn ==\nThe album is influenced by a lot of different electronic music from the eighties to present, spanning from New Romantic synth pop to more dark edge alternative pop.\nThe band released their first single \"Yet It's Love\" taken from Watch It All Turn in September 2010, and the music video quickly entered NRK Svisj with MTV soon to follow.\nThe song \"Six Strings From Hell\" was in July 2009 picked up by Major Records, Germany and released on Orbit Electro Vol1 Archived 2011-06-15 at the Wayback Machine.\n\n\n== Dangerous Game ==\nTheir second studio album, entitled Dangerous Game was released in September 2012, and has a darker edge compared to the debut album Watch It All Turn. Still the album contains more poppy tracks such as \"Dancing Girl\" and \"Love Thief\". \nThe band has stated that they are out to continue in the field of albums such as Violator and Songs Of Faith And Devotion by Depeche Mode back in the 90's. The album Dangerous Game was suggested as the best electro pop album for 2012 by Side Line Magazine .\n\n\n== Live ==\nThe band had their live debut performance on the ElectroStat festival in October 2010 at Maanefisken, Oslo, and played prime time as the last band on stage before headliner Mesh, with massive response from the audience.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2009: \"Watch It All Turn\" (Album)\n2010: \"Yet It's Love\" (Single)\n2010: \"Monster\" (Single / free digital download)\n2011: \"Suspicious Minds\" (Single)\n2012: \"Dancing Girl\" (Single)\n2012: \"Dangerous Game\" (Album)\n2013: \"Tokyo Shuffle\" [EP]\n2013: \"Pop Ghost\" [Album]\n2014: \"Bullets & Desert Blooms\" (Album)\n2015: \"The River\" (Single)\n2016: \"Beautiful Lies\" (Album)\n2018: \"A Man-Made Sun\" (Album)\n2021: \"The endless Sky\" (Single)\n2022: \"Stereo Dreams, Pt. 1\" (EP)\n2022: \"Stereo Dreams, Pt. 2\" (EP)\n2022: \"Stereo Dreams, Pt. 3\" (EP)\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\nElectro Spectre @ ElektroStat Archived 2012-03-22 at the Wayback Machine\nElectro Spectre in Side-Line music magazine\nReview of concert at Maanefisken, Oslo 2010\nReview in Side Line Magazine\n\n\n== External links ==\nCrab Key Records's channel on YouTube"

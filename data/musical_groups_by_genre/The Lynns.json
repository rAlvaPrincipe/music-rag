    "text": "The Lynns are an American country music duo, consisting of twin sisters Peggy Lynn and Patsy Lynn (born August 6, 1964), who are the youngest daughters of Oliver Lynn and singer Loretta Lynn.\nThey recorded one album for Reprise Records, which charted two singles on Hot Country Songs. The Lynns have received CMA Award nominations for Vocal Duo of the Year in 1998 and 1999.\nTheir album was met with mixed reception. Peter Margasak of Chicago Reader wrote that \"musically they don't show much more spunk. Their singing...is no match for their mother's, but they're certainly not alone there....most of the material is typical Nashville mush: weepy ballads and tame, predictable rockers.\" Jason Ankeny of AllMusic praised the duo's \"powerful voices\" but criticized the \"formulaic production\".\nPatsy's daughter, Emmy Russell, auditioned for season 22 of American Idol, making the cut and earning the golden ticket to Hollywood.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== The Lynns ===\n\nTrack listing\n\"Crazy World of Love\" (Patsy Lynn, Peggy Lynn, Philip Russell) - 2:36\n\"Woman to Woman\" (Patsy Lynn, Peggy Lynn, Russell) -3:32\n\"This Must Be Love\" (Kostas, James House) - 2:23\n\"It Hurts\" (Patsy Lynn, Peggy Lynn) - 4:08\n\"Cry Cry Baby\" (Patsy Lynn, Peggy Lynn, James Lewis) - 3:03\n\"Nights Like These\" (Patsy Lynn, Peggy Lynn) - 3:10\n\"Oh My Goodness\" (Patsy Lynn, Peggy Lynn, Mitch Callis) - 3:29\n\"What Am I Doing Loving You\" (Jamie O'Hara) - 2:47\n\"I Won't Leave This World Unloved\" (Patsy Lynn, Jaime Kyle, Pat Bunch) - 3:08\n\"Someday\" (Peggy Lynn, Patsy Lynn, Lewis) - 3:05\nMusicians\nFrom The Lynns liner notes.\n\nDennis Burnside - piano, keyboards, Hammond B-3 organ\nMark Casstevens - acoustic guitar\nLarry Franklin - fiddle\nJames House - acoustic guitar\nDavid Hungate - bass guitar, acoustic bass guitar\nLloyd Maines - steel guitar\nPat McGrath - electric guitar\nSteve Nathan - piano, keyboards, Hammond B-3 organ\nTony Paoletta - steel guitar, lap steel guitar\nBrent Rowan - electric guitar\nBob Warren - percussion\nBiff Watson - acoustic guitar\nLonnie Wilson - drums, percussion\nTechnical\nMike Bradley - recording, mixing\nDon Cook - producer\nDale Dodson - associate producer\nKen Love - mastering\nPat McMakin - recording\nKenny Royster - vocal arrangement\nHank Williams - mastering\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References =="

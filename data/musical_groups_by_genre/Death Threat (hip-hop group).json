    "text": "Death Threat is a hip-hop group in the Philippines. The group is credited for pioneering gangsta rap in the Philippines and for launching the career of Gloc-9.\n\n\n== History ==\nDeath Threat initially consisted of Ron \"Beware\" Salonga and Gerald \"Genezide\" Acelajado. Their self-titled debut album Death Threat:Gusto Kong Bumaet was released in 1993. It contained the song \"Gusto Kong Bumaet (Pero 'Di Ko Magawa)\" (in English: \"I Want to Become Good (But I Cannot)\") which told tales of the daily lives of the young impoverished Filipino youth growing up in the city streets and slum areas. It is considered the first Filipino gangsta rap album and was certified gold.\nThree years later, they added more members with emcees Michael P. \"Hi-Jakkk\" Reyes, and Lawrence \"O-Dogg\" Panganiban. They were also joined by Aristotle Pollisco. The group suggested him the rap alias \"Glock-9\". He then changed it to \"Gloc-9\". Their second album, Death Threat: Wanted contained the song \"Ilibing ng Buhay (Ang Mga Sosyal)\" (in English: \"Bury (The Elitists) Alive\") with Pooch (the alter-ego of Andrew E.). The song became a hit despite not getting radio play. Another song, \"Who's Next?\", is considered one of the first Filipino diss tracks written, as they called out rival rappers and the radio station LA 105.9. The album itself was certified double platinum.\nBeware left the Philippines after the release of the album, and the group became the duo of Hi-Jakkk and Gloc-9, and released the third album Kings of da Undaground in 1997. Kings of da Undaground went on to become a four-time platinum album. Beware then returned to the Philippines in 1998 to release the album Death Threat: The Return that was recorded in California.\nIn 2002, Death Threat released another album, Death Threat: Still Wanted. It contained 'Private Diane\", which featured Ely Buendia and Francis Magalona.\nDuring the 2000s, several members left the group. For a time, Gloc-9 and Hi-Jakkk performed together as a duo, releasing Domination I and Domination II. Hi-Jakk produced and arranged their albums. Gloc-9 then signed with Star Music and became one of the best-selling and most successful hip-hop artists in the Philippines. Hi-Jakkk also became a solo artist, releasing several albums and worked with ABS-CBN Music in 2023. \"O-Dogg\" spent the next 15 years an RTC employee. In 2014, he was shot dead in Muntinlupa.\nIn 2019, Death Threat performed on the Wish 107.5 bus. They also released \"Gusto Kong Bumaet Pero Di Ko Magawa: Part 2\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1993: Death Threat: Gusto Kong Bumaet\n1995: Death Threat: Wanted\n1997: Kings of da Undaground\n1998: Beware: The Return (O.G.

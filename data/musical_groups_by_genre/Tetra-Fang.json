    "text": "Tetra-Fang (stylized as TETRA-FANG) is a Japanese pop-rock band considered a \"limited rock unit\" and was formed to perform songs on the soundtrack for the 2008 Kamen Rider Series Kamen Rider Kiva.\n\n\n== History ==\nTetra-Fang was formed in 2008 to serve as a promotional band for Kamen Rider Kiva. The group composes music in a rock style and features a rotating line-up of members for each of their singles. Koji Seto who portrays Wataru Kurenai, the lead character in Kamen Rider Kiva, serves as Koji, the lead vocalist of the group for the single releases of \"Destiny's Play\" and \"Individual-System.\" \"Destiny's Play\" was released on April 23, 2008, and came with a DVD containing a music video for the song. The single ranked 25th on the Japanese Oricon Weekly Single's Charts in its first week. \"Individual-System\" was released on June 25, 2008, and was the second ending theme for Kamen Rider Kiva.\nAn arrangement of \"Individual-System\" was released one month after the initial release of the original version on July 30, 2008, and featured Keisuke Kato on vocals, known as \"Fight for Justice: Individual-System Nago Ver.\". Also, on August 6, 2008, a mini-album was released, Supernova, after the song of the same name used as Emperor Form's theme song. It also features character songs for Garulu, Basshaa, and Dogga, two of which have been featured as the ending theme in the series.\nIn early December, the band released their first and only fully original album entitled Destiny. The album contained numerous character songs written by previous tokusatsu songwriters including Ryo and Shuhei Naruse. The album also included the tracks Destiny's Play, Individual System, Roots of the King and Supernova from previous releases.\nAlso in December, another album was released called Inherited System, which contained character songs sung by actors who have used the IXA System in the TV series. Two Tetra-Fang songs were included in the release, which were Individual System and Fight for Justice.\nThe group officially disbanded after Kamen Rider Kiva had completed its broadcasting, however both keyboardist Shuhei and guitarist Ayano continue to be involved in the musical side of the Kamen Rider franchise. Shuhei and Ayano reunited as part of the Kamen Rider Decade series, producing three albums of cover versions of previous Kamen Rider theme songs. The songs arranged by Shuhei featured Ayano on guitar. Both musicians have since continued providing their musical services for the franchise, composing and performing several songs featured in the various series.\nThe popularity of the group however resulted in a reunion for a final album consisting mostly of covers of previous Tetra-Fang songs. The album however, entitled Masked Rider Kiva Destiny's Play Re-Union, did include three original songs; two sung by Kivat and the final track sung by Wataru and Otoya as a duet.\n\n\n== Members ==\nKoji Seto as Koji: vocals\nShuhei Naruse as Shuhei: keyboard\nYuji: lead guitar (\"Destiny's Play\")\nRoy: bass (\"Destiny's Play\")\nUme: bass (\"Individual-System\" & Supernova)\nAyano: lead guitar (\"Individual-System\" & Supernova)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Destiny's Play\" - April 23, 2008\n\"Destiny's Play\"\n\"Destiny's Play Neo Romanesque Guitar Edit\"\n\"Destiny's Play Additional Kivat-bat the 3rd Edit\"\n\"Destiny's Play Instrumental\"\n\"Individual-System\" - June 25, 2008\n\"Individual-System\"\n\"Individual-System Technical Guitar Fist\"\n\"Individual-System Instrumental\"\n\"Individual-System Nago Advance Fist\"\n\"Roots of the King\" - November 12, 2008\n\"Roots of the King\"\n\"Individual-System Acoustic Fist\"\n\"Roots of the King Instrumental\"\n\"Individual-System Acoustic Fist Instrumental\"\n\n\n=== Mini-albums ===\nSupernova - August 6, 2008\nCD\n\"Entrance Procession\"\n\"Supernova [Tribute to Emperor Form]\"\n\"Shout in the Moonlight [Tribute to Garulu]\"\n\"Innocent Trap [Tribute to Basshaa]\"\n\"Silent Shout [Tribute to Dogga]\"\n\"Message [Tribute to Father]\"\nDVD\n\"Entrance Procession\" Music Clip\n\"Supernova\" Music Clip\n\"Message\" Music Clip\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nDestiny - December 3, 2008\n\"Mind Garden\"[Tribute to Wataru] \n\"Destiny's Play\"\n\"Roots of the King\"\n\"Lightning to Heaven\" [Tribute to Rook]\n\"Exterminate Time\" [Tribute to King]\n\"Eternity Blood\" [Tribute to Bishop]\n\"Supernova\"\n\"Individual-System\"\n\"Rainy Rose\" [Tribute to Queen]\n\"Prayer: Message2\"\n\"No Matter Who You Are\"\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\"Fight For Justice: Individual-System Nago Ver.\" by Keisuke Nago (Keisuke Kato) - July 30, 2008\nFor the appearance of Kamen Rider Rising IXA in the series, Keisuke Kato was asked to record a new arrangement/cover of \"Individual-System\" in the character of Nago.

In an album review of the 2002 release Liquid,  AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia acknowledged the albums lasting influence stating in part that \"Liquid still stands as a major accomplishment in the ambient rock field, and a recommended introduction to both 35007 and the genre at large.\" In 2005 the band, now with Tos Nieuwenhuizen from Beaver on guitar, released Phase V but was never seen on stage again.\nTheir live shows were accompanied with visual effects, such as psychedelic videos projected on stage. AllMusic also noted that they would use a \"visual specialist to provide a truly multimedia and multi-sensory experience\" to create \"ambient trance-groove music of a predominantly instrumental design.\"\nIn the years after Phase V Bertus Fridael started his own band Mother-Unit, Sander Evers played in Gomer Pyle between 2006 and 2010, he is currently performing with the band Monomyth, Jacco van Rooy joined Motorpsycho for a short period of time and is now in the band Neon Twin, Tos Nieuwenhuizen performed live with Sunn O))), Mark and Luk Sponselee produced experimental music in Group Art Fou.\n35007 performed several times at the annual international Roadburn Festival in the Netherlands, as well as the other groups in which the former members of 35007 play.\nDecember 2012 saw a vinyl release of Phase V on Burning World records.\nOn the December 30, 2012, Mark Sponselee died from the effects of pneumonia.\nBassist Michel Boekhoudt died on February 18, 2022.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nEspecially for You (1994)\n35007 (sometimes credited as 'Into the Void We Travelled') (1997)\nLiquid (2002)\nPhase V (2005)\n\n\n=== Others ===\nSea of Tranquillity EP (2001)\nPhase V Vinyl Edition (2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site\n35007 at AllMusic\n35007 discography at MusicBrainz"

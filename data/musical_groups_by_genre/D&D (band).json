Their first two singles, \"In Your Eyes\" and \"Love Is a Melody\" were used as background music for commercials for Yuri Takano Beauty Clinic that featured Namie Amuro as their spokesperson.

It was commercially successful, debuting at number 5 on Oricon's albums chart, and was certified gold by the RIAJ for more than 250,000 copies shipped to stores. After Olivia participated in a collaboration song with Jean Michel Jarre and Tetsuya Komuro written for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, \"Together Now,\" she began releasing material as a soloist. Chikano and Aya continued to release music together, as Aya & Chika from D&D. They released the single \"Kiss in the Sun\" in September 1998, followed by the opening theme song for the anime Power Stone, \"Rise in My Heart,\" in April 1999. The group intended to release a third single in September 1999, however this was cancelled.\nIn July 2000, Aya and Chikano joined the girl group Hipp's, who performed in the television show The Night of Hit Parade, although Aya left the group several months later.The group, featuring Chika using her real name Chikano Higa (比嘉千賀乃), made their CD debut in 2001 with the song \"Go!

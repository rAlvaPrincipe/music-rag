    "text": "BXB (Korean: 비엑스비) is a South Korean idol group signed to Wolfburn. Following the disbandment of boy group TRCNG, former bandmates Jihun, Hyunwoo, Siwoo, and Hamin formed the quartet APR Project and began releasing music in 2022. With the addition of June, BXB released its album Intro: Flight and a New Beginning in January 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2017–2022: Background and formation ===\nIn 2017, TS Entertainment debuted TRCNG with ten members. In April 2018, the CEO of the record label died; company operations were negatively impacted and promotional activities for the group stalled. In November 2019, members Wooyeop and Taeseon filed a suit against the agency, citing alleged abuse by staff and requesting the termination of their contracts. TRCNG disbanded in March 2022.\nLater that year, the group APR Project—short for April Project—was formed by APR Entertainment with former TRCNG members Jihun (leader, vocals), Hyunwoo (rap), Siwoo (rap, vocals), and Hamin (vocals). They sought to have the other former members be part of the new group, but they did not join either due to mandatory military service or personal reasons. APR Project planned to release a \"youth trilogy\" dealing with sorrow, beginnings, and flight. It released its first single album entitled Boyhood I S#1 on June 6. It was supported by the single \"11:59\", a future R&B song about the \"sorrow of youth\". Four months later, the quartet released the single album Boyhood I S#2 and the uptempo pop lead track \"Scene\" with a guest feature by former bandmate Hohyeon.\n\n\n=== 2023–present: Debut ===\nOn January 10, 2023, record label Wolfburn uploaded a BXB logo motion video and announced its plans to debut the five-member group comprising the APR Project members with the addition of June. An acronym for Boy by Brush, the name signifies \"that the members will paint the scenes and emotions of youth with their music.\" Following a series of video and photo teasers, BXB released its single album and final installment of its trilogy Intro: Flight and a New Beginning on January 30, 2023. It was accompanied by the single \"Fly Away\", an uptempo pop rock number. BXB competed on the reality competition show Peak Time (2023) as Team 04:00. Citing health reasons, Jun began a hiatus from promotional activities later that year. The group released its first single album Chapter 1. Our Youth and mid-tempo R&B single \"Planet\" on August 3.\nBXB recorded \"The Black Cat Nero\", a remake of the Italian children's song \"Volevo un gatto nero\", and made it available as a pre-release track one week ahead of its second single album. Chapter 2. Wings and funky gospel-inspired pop single \"Airplane\" were released on January 11, 2024.\n\n\n== Members ==\nList of members and roles.\n\nJihun – vocals\nHyunwoo – leader, rap\nSiwoo – rap\nHamin – vocals\nJune – vocals (on hiatus since 2023)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Single albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Television shows ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

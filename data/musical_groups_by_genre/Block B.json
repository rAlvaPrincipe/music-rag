    "text": "Block B (Korean: 블락비) is a South Korean boy band managed by KQ Entertainment, and consists of seven members: Taeil, B-Bomb, Jaehyo, U-Kwon, Park Kyung, Zico, and P.O. Block B has received several accolades, including nominations for seven Golden Disc Awards and eleven Seoul Music Awards.\nBlock B was created by musician Cho PD in 2011 on a budget of US$1.4 million. They made their live debut on KBS' Music Bank and MTV's Match Up!. In 2012, they released their debut studio album, Blockbuster, which finished in the top ten on the Billboard Korea and Gaon Album charts.\nIn 2013, Block B filed a lawsuit against Stardom Entertainment—their agency at the time—and took a small break from releasing music and performing live.\nBlock B achieved commercial success with the single albums Jackpot (2014), Very Good (2015) and H.E.R. (2015). In 2016, they released the Japanese-language studio album, My Zone, which ranked in the top ten on the Billboard Japan and Oricon charts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2011–2013: Formation and beginnings ===\n\nIn February 2011, Cho PD announced that he would spend US$1.4 million to create a seven-member hip-hop group under his \"Creating Korea's Eminem Project\". On April 13, 2011, their debut music video for \"Freeze!\" was released, but banned by the Commission of Youth Protection because they felt that it was too sexy for Korean television. As a result, the song could not be sold to minors under the age of 19, and the video could not be aired before 10 pm.\nOn April 15, 2011, Block B made their live debut on KBS Music Bank. The group followed up with another track, \"Wanna B\". A mini album, New Kids on the Block, was released on June 23, 2011. On June 22, 2011, the first episode of MTV's eight-episode series Match Up! was aired featuring Block B and B1A4. On October 16, 2011, MTV started airing a series of specials for the Match Up series that followed Block B as they promoted in Japan.\nOn January 3, 2013, it was reported that Block B had filed a suit against their agency to ask for their exclusive contract to be canceled. According to media reports, the Block B members filed against Stardom at the Seoul Central District Court and stated \"During the signing of the exclusive contract, it was promised that in addition to providing proper training opportunity and facilities, we would be paid on every 25th of the following month... However, the agency has not paid us for nearly one year since April 2011.\" They stated: \"The CEO of the agency, Mr. Lee, has also disappeared with the 70,000,000 KRW (~66,000 USD) that he collected from the members' parents.\" On May 20, 2013, it was reported that Lee had committed suicide.\nOn June 7, 2013, the court ruled in favor of the company, saying \"It's difficult to see the company not being able to pay the group as intentional. From the evidence provided so far, it is difficult to claim that the label purposely did not pay Block B. It is also difficult to say that the label did not provide proper facilities such as studios and dorms, and it is also difficult to say that they did not provide education and guidance. From written records, it cannot be said that Stardom Entertainment violated their management obligations. There is a possibility that the musical income of 430,000,000 KRW (approximately $385,000 USD) and the event income of 5,000,000 KRW (approximately $4,500 USD) was not properly taken care of. However, from just the evidence provided, it cannot be said that the label purposely kept the money from the members.\"\n\n\n=== 2013–2014: Blockbuster and mini albums ===\nOn August 29, 2013, Block B announced that they had negotiated the transfer of their rights from Stardom to a new management company, Seven Seasons.

    "text": "Toshiya Miyata (Japanese: 宮田俊哉, Hepburn: Toshiya Miyata, born September 14, 1988) is a Japanese singer, actor, TV personality, voice actor, and novelist. he is a member of boys band Kis-My-Ft2 and its derivative group Busaiku(舞祭組) under Starto Entertainment. His nickname is Miyacchi.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince Miyata's mother was a big fan of Koichi Domoto of the Kinki Kids and hoped her son would become a prince-like star like Koichi, she sent Miyata's resume to the Johnny & Associates. After auditioning, Miyata joined Johnny & Associates on February 4, 2001. Wataru Yokoo and Takashi Nikaido, who would later become members of Kis-My-Ft2, also participated in the same audition.\nAfter joining several groups as a trainee (Johnny's Jr.), he was selected as a member of Kis-My-Ft2 in 2005 and made his CD debut with Everybody Go on August 10, 2011, seven years after their formation.\nIn April 2012, he made his first appearance in a drama series on Nippon Television's Shiritsu Bakaleya Kōkō, and in October of the same year, he made his first film appearance in its film version, Shiritsu Bakaleya Kōkō \n the Movie (劇場版 私立バカレア高校).\nIn May 2013, he played his first starring role on stage in Adventure in the Land of Kifsham (キフシャム国の冒険). \nOn December the same year, Busaiku was formed from Kis-My-Ft2 with Kento Senga, Wataru Yokoo and Takashi Nikaido produced by Masahiro Nakai who was a member of SMAP.\nEven before his debut, he professed his love of anime (anime geek: \"otaku\"), which was unusual for an idol at the time. He has also appeared in animated productions as a voice actor, playing the lead role in 2024.\nThe music video for his solo song Nemophila, released on YouTube in May 2021, featured Miyata and Tokiya Ichinose who is an idol from the game/anime work Uta no Prince-sama. As it was unusual for an idol and a character from a game/anime to perform together on the same screen, the music video received a strong response from anime fans.\nOn August 4, 2023, he opened his personal official X (formerly Twitter) account.\nIn January 2024, he opened his personal official Instagram. He made his debut as an author with his novel Boundary Melody, on May the same year.\n\n\n== Anecdotes about Anime ==\n\n\n=== Love for Nana Mizuki and Love Live! ===\nMiyata is big fan of Nana Mizuki, a voice actress and singer, professes to be a member of Nana Mizuki's fan club and always carries his fan club membership card in his wallet.\nHe is also a fan of the popular anime Love Live! and has been selected to host a related program. \nOne day in winter 2014, Miyata went to Love Live! event, he stood in line for four hours in heavy snow, along with the general public, to buy penlights for merchandise. Then the train stopped because of snow and he had to spend three hours at the station. Another day in spring 2016, he went to a Love Live! event, he lied to his agent and took the day off to go to the event wearing a T-shirt from the anime. However Miyata's presence was found by fans who came to see the concert, and his picture was circulated on Social networking service. As a result, he was angered by managers from his agent who told him, \"You are the one whom your fans being obsessed with, so it's not right for you are obsessed with someone else\". However, he was scheduled to attend a concert by Nana Mizuki the following week, so he went out without hesitation, but he was also found, and he was angered by managers again.\nAside from these well-known stories, he is often seen making private visits to Comiket venues and anime events. He and Daisuke Sakuma of Snow Man, a junior member of his agent, hit it off because of their love of anime and have been close since they were trainees, even though they are senior and junior. They named this duo is\n\"Miyata faction\".\n\n\n=== Regarding Vanguard starring ===\nIt was announced in December 2023 that Miyata would be the lead voice actor for the anime Cardfight!! Vanguard Divinez, which would air from January of the following year. Bushiroad President Takaaki Kidani said that he first became aware of Miyata at a 2016 Love Live! event at a 2016 Sunshine City, Tokyo, where he heard about a TV personality who stood in line for three hours to buy merchandise, and that is how he came to know him. He also said that the story starring Miyata had been warming up for a year, but when the Johnny & Associates held a press conference in September 2023 admitting the founder's guilt, Miyata's appointment was temporarily in jeopardy since the anime would broadcast around the world. However, Kidani said that Japanese animation industry has so far been indebted to Miyata, and that although many people in the world suddenly change their attitudes for the talent of Johnny's, he wanted to deal with Miyata as a human being, not as \"J\" (Johnny's), and decided to appoint him as originally planned. Miyata talked about this story on his radio program Burn! Radio, he revealed that he had been spending anxious days at the time, and that he was \"really saved\" when Kidani said he wanted to work with him on the project.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Solo and small group songs ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Films ===\nShiritsu Bakaleya Kōkō — The Movie - as Junichi Koba - (October 13, 2012)\nTsugaru Lacquer Girl - as Naoto Suzuki - (September 1, 2023)\n\n\n=== Television drama ===\nShiritsu Bakaleya Kōkō (April 14, 2012 - June 30, 2012, Nippon TV) - Junichi Koba\nSekai ni Bizarre Story '13 Autumn Special Edition \"0.03 Frame Woman\" (October 12, 2013, Fuji TV) - Satoshi Kariya\nShinbei with Child - (November 13 - December 18, 2015, NHK BS Premium) - Seizaburo Enokido\nShinbei with Child season2 (November 11 - December 23, 2016, NHK BS Premium) - Seizaburo Enokido\nMonday Golden Public Prosecutor's Office Clerk, Kuroyuri (February 22, 2016, TBS Television (Japan)) - Naoki Munakata\nMonday Golden Private Forensic Investigation: Kirino Mai's Murder Appraisal - (March 14, 2016, TBS Television (Japan)) -  Kenta Asakura\nXXX People's Lives - (April 24 [midnight on April 23] - June 26 (midnight on June 25), 2018, Nippon TV) - as Yoichi Mano, the group lead (starring in a quartet with Wataru Yokoo, Takashi Nikaido and Kento Senga)\nYasuragi no Toki - Michi - (April 8, 2019 - March 27, 2020, TV Asahi) - as Kouji Negoro\nMidsummer Boy - 19452020 Final Episode (September 18, 2020, TV Asahi)\nKarei-naru Ichizoku (April 18, 2021 - July 4, 2021, Wowow) - Kazuya Hosokawa\nDoctor White - (January 17, 2022 - March 21, 2022, Kansai Telecasting Corporation/Fuji TV) - Junpei Okumura\nDoctor White Special Edition (March 28, 2022, Kansai Telecasting Corporation/Fuji TV) \nNice Flight! -Final episode (September 9, 2022, TV Asahi) - Ryo Enomoto\nSmiling Lady episode 4 (August 17, 2024, Tōkai Television Broadcasting, Fuji Television) - Kanzaki Doguma\n\n\n=== Streaming drama ===\nBe Love - (October 16 - November 6, 2020, Lemino(dTV)) - Editor\n\n\n=== Animation Works ===\nDelicious Party Pretty Cure (June 5, 2022 - January 29, 2023, TV Asahi) - Yuan Kasai and Mitsuki Kasai (two roles)\nBanG Dream!

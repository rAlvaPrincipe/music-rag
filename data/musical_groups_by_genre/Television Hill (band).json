Fourteen folk, country, rock songs that make you feel like your listening to The Band fronted by Mick and Keith and everybody's been sipping from the mason jar.\"\nIn 2006 Television Hill recorded a live 8-song EP of their performance at Rodney Henry's Dangerously Delicious Pies in Baltimore, MD. Although it currently remains unreleased, it has been widely circulated among Television Hill's fan base. It features material from Twilight, My Name's Hardin and a forthcoming full-length recording tentatively titled Another Naked Hour.\nBaltimore supergroup Television Hill and Friends Records are pleased to announce the much anticipated release of My Name's Hardin (FR008). This six song limited edition vinyl concept EP is due out in February 2013 and takes a poke at the title of Bob Dylan's 1967 release John Wesley Harding. My name's Hardin is a musical biography that explores the life and lore of the fastest gun in the West, Wes Hardin, also paying equal homage to Dylan's recording and Johnny Cash's double concept album Sings the Ballads of the True West. Drawing from Hardin's autobiography, his Letters from Prison and an assortment of other relevant biographical material, Television Hill examines the Wes Hardin of legend & song, serving up savory mesquite seasoned tales of pride, bloodlust, and a cycle of violence that would ultimately consume the legendary Texas outlaw. Cowtown caterwauling, gritty guitars and rolling hill country rhythms cleverly coalesce to re-create the cattle trails, jail cells and whiskey soaked saloons of the Reconstruction Era South in this half-hour epic. The band's all-star line-up on this recording consists of singer/songwriter Rob Wilson, Arbouretum's Dave Heumann, Celebration's David Bergander and Walker Teret, with additional performances by Tony Drummond.\nIn 2010 the band also began recording Pieces of Eight with old friend Rob Girardi at Lord Baltimore Recording. A raucous eight song romp through the sandy shoals of the Eastern Seaboard and beyond. This lively exploration of tales & legends of Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, Tommy Tew and other  salty dogs will also include some special guest performances.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2005: Twilight TNRL001\n2014: Another Naked Hour TBA\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n2013: My Name's Hardin  FR008\n2013: Pieces of Eight   TBA\n\n\n== External links ==\nTelevision Hill on FaceBook\nTelevision Hill website\nTelevision Hill on MySpace\nTelevision Hill on WYPRs The Signal\nTelevision Hill on YouTube\nTelevision Hill on Vimeo\nFriends Records"

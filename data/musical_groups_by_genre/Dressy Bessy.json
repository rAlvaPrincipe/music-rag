    "text": "Dressy Bessy is an indie rock band from Denver, Colorado led by songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist, Tammy Ealom. The band is associated with the Elephant Six Recording Company and shares guitarist John Hill with The Apples in Stereo. Ealom formed the band with drummer Darren Albert and bassist Rob Greene in 1996. Hill joined the band after helping engineer early recordings in 1997.  The name was taken from a popular Playskool doll of the 1970s.\n\n\n== 1996–Present ==\nThey released two singles and an EP in 1997–98 and licensed songs to some compilation albums.\nDressy Bessy's first full-length release Pink Hearts, Yellow Moons (1999) was a mixture of beat group drums, infectious songs, and the odd burst of harmonium.  Further releases include The California EP (2000), Sound Go Round (2002), and 2003's Dressy Bessy, which incorporated a harder guitar sound.  2003 also brought the compilation Little Music: Singles 1997-2002.  These albums were initially released on  Kindercore Records of Athens, Georgia. Their songs \"If You Should Try to Kiss Her\" and \"Just Like Henry\" were featured in the 1999 indie film But I'm a Cheerleader.\nIn late 2003, drummer Darren Albert left the band and was replaced in 2005 by Craig Gilbert.  Later that year, the band signed to Transdreamer Records and recorded their fourth album, Electrified, which was released in June 2005. The band released HOLLERandSTOMP, on September 16, 2008.\nDressy Bessy released KINGSIZED on Yep Roc Records (CD, LP) and Burger Records (CS), February 5, 2016.\nThe band's seventh studio album, titled Fast Faster Disaster, was released June 14, 2019  by Yep Roc Records and Burger Records\n\n\n== Members ==\nTammy Ealom – Guitar, Lead Vocals (1996–Present)\nRob Greene – Bass (1996–2014)\nDarren Albert – Drums (1996–2003)\nJohn Hill – Guitar (1997–Present)\nBecky Barron – Drums (2004) (Touring Member)\nCraig Gilbert – Drums (2005–Present)\nJames Barone – Drums (2008) (Touring Member)\nPaul Garcia – Guitar, Keys, Percussion (2008) (Touring Member)\nJeff Fuller – Bass (2016–2017) (Touring Member)\nMichael Giblin – Bass (2016–2018) (Touring Member, Recording Contributor)\nEric Allen – Bass (2018) (Touring Member, Recording Contributor)\nLindsay Romig – Keys (Touring Member, Recording Contributor)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nPink Hearts Yellow Moons (Kindercore; CD/LP; 1999)\nSoundGoRound (Kindercore; CD/LP; 2002)\nLittle Music: Singles 1997-2002 (Kindercore; CD/LP; 2003)\nDressy Bessy (Kindercore; CD; 2003)\nElectrified (Transdreamer Records; CD/LP; 2005)\nHoller and Stomp (Transdreamer Records; CD/LP; 2008)\nKINGSIZED (Yep Roc Records / Burger Records; CD/LP/CS; 2016)\nFast Faster Disaster (Yep Roc Records / Burger Records; CD/LP; 2019)\n\n\n=== EPs and singles ===\nUltra Vivid Color (Little Dipper; 7\"; 1997)\nYou Stand Here (Drug Racer; CD; 1998)\nSunny (100 Guitar Mania; 7\"; 1999)\nThe California EP (Kindercore; CD; 2000)\nSplit w/ Saloon (Track & Field Organisation; 7\"; 2002)\nLady Liberty b/w What Is Life (Yep Roc Records; 7\"; 2015)\nSummer Singles Volume 1 & 2 (High Dive Records: 7\"; 2017)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\"The Things That You Say That You Do\" on Dive Right Inn: The Only Spring Break CD You'll Need (American Eagle Outfitters; CD; 2004)\n\"Makeup\" on Pure Spun Sugar (CandyFloss; LP; 1998)\n\"Extra-Ordinary\" on A Bunch Of Beatniks Riding A Rocket (Red Carpet Ring; Cassette; 1999)\n\"Lookaround\" on Beikoku-Ongaku vol. 13 (Beikoku-Ongaku; CD/Mag; 1999)\n\"Just Like Henry\" on Counterattack Of U.S. Indie (Contact; CD; 1999)\n\"All The Right Reasons\" on Christmas Two (Kindercore; CD; 1999)\n\"Bubbles\" on The Powerpuff Girls: Heroes And Villains (Rhino; CD; 2000)\n\"Gloria Days\" on Songs For A Crimson Eggtree (Earworm; LP; 2000)\n\"Instead\" on Kindercore Fifty (Kindercore; 3 CDs; 2000)\n\"Some Better Days\" on The Winter Report (Hype City; CD; 2001)\n\"Extra-Ordinary (re-mix)\" on Space Program (Philter; CD; 2001)\n\"Side 2\" on Quiero ser linda como Ale !!!

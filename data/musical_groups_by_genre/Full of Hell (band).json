    "text": "Full of Hell is an American grindcore band from Ocean City, Maryland, and Central Pennsylvania, that formed in 2009. They are currently signed to Relapse Records and have released six studio albums – Roots of Earth Are Consuming My Home (2011), Rudiments of Mutilation (2013), Trumpeting Ecstasy (2017), Weeping Choir (2019), Garden of Burning Apparitions (2021), and Coagulated Bliss (2024) – as well as several EPs and splits. In addition to studio albums, they've released five collaboration albums – Full of Hell & Merzbow (2014) with Japanese noise artist Merzbow, One Day You Will Ache Like I Ache (2016) and Ascending a Mountain of Heavy Light (2017) with sludge metal band the Body, Suffocating Hallucination with doom metal band Primitive Man in March 2023 and When No Birds Sang with shoegaze band Nothing in December 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band formed in 2009, having signed to A389 Recordings and Profound Lore Records in their first few years, releasing three full-length albums: Roots of Earth Are Consuming My Home in 2011, Rudiments of Mutilation in 2013, and Full of Hell & Merzbow, a collaboration with Japanese noise artist Merzbow, in 2014.\nIn 2015, original bassist Brandon Brown left the band. He was replaced by Sam DiGristine of Jarhead Fertilizer—an associated act that also features Brown, as well as drummer Dave Bland. Spencer Hazard follows a straight edge lifestyle, while Bland is the only vegan.\nOn January 8, 2016, Full of Hell released a four-song EP titled Amber Mote in the Black Vault through Bad Teeth Recordings. The release featured three original tracks and a cover of Melvins' track \"Oven,\" originally released on their 1989 album Ozma. Describing their reasoning for selecting this track, the band explained: \"We had been wanting to cover a Melvins song for years, and 'Oven' had always been one of our top choices. We've always been very inspired by the Melvins on every level—a totally unique and uncompromising band that has always worked their asses off. They are a band that's undefinable but always recognizable. Totally brilliant. With past covers that we've done, we've always deviated from the source material, but this time we chose to stick close to the original sound and tempo.\"\n\nFull of Hell began plotting to follow up Full of Hell & Merzbow with another collaborative album with avant-garde metal band The Body after a successful 2015 tour together. The two acts expected to head into the studio together to record an album without previously writing any material. Titled One Day You Will Ache Like I Ache, the collaboration album was released on March 25, 2016 through Neurot Recordings—a label founded by members of Neurosis and Tribes of Neurot.\nFull of Hell's fifth studio album, Trumpeting Ecstasy was released on May 5, 2017. The album was ranked number 4 on Exclaim!'s Top 10 Metal and Hardcore Albums of 2017.\nOn February 13, 2018, the band announced that they had signed to Relapse Records.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

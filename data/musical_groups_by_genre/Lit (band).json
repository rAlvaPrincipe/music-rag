    "text": "Lit is an American rock band formed in 1988 in Orange County, California. They have released seven studio albums, but are best known for their 1999 album A Place in the Sun, which featured the hit single \"My Own Worst Enemy\". \"Zip-Lock\" and \"Miserable\" were also successful, leading to a platinum certification for A Place in the Sun.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Lit (1986–1995) ===\nGuitarist Jeremy Popoff and bassist Kevin Baldes met in 1986, and soon after, began playing music together. In 1987, Popoff (guitar), Jerry Neel (bass), Dave Barber (drums) and Derek Johnson (vocals) formed the band Strate Lace and performed three live shows together: The Troubador in Hollywood, The Waters Club in San Pedro, and a back-to-school party in a friend's backyard. Neel quit the band early on to pursue a career in the mortgage industry and Johnson would go on to attend the Trebas Institute of Recording Arts in Hollywood, California, where he learned to produce and engineer. On February 20, 2003, Derek Johnson was among the 100 killed in the nightclub fire while attending a Great White concert at The Station in West Warwick, Rhode Island.\nMeanwhile, around 1988, high school friends Baldes (15 or 16 at the time) and Jeremy Popoff's brother, A. Jay, (14 at the time) formed the pop metal band Razzle. The lineup being Kevin Baldes (lead vocals, bass), A. Jay Popoff (drums), and Sean Holland (guitar). They performed their first show on June 26, 1988, at The Troubadour. In 1989, A. Jay switched from drums to lead vocals, and the band added guitarist Jeremy Popoff and drummer Allen Shellenberger. Things began to come together in 1990, when the group released a demo tape (engineered by Derek Johnson, the singer of Strate Lace) and an EP entitled New Vibe Revolution in 1993. Razzle dissolved in 1993 and became Stain in 1994, which had a much harder and heavier sound. They released a demo tape in 1995 and eventually signed with Malicious Vinyl in 1995.

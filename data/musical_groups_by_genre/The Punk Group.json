    "text": "The Punk Group is an electro/synth-rock band originating from Portland, Oregon.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe group began in 2002 \"as a joke\" and consists of two human members, Brian Applegate and Summer Cameron, who dub themselves \"The Model\" and \"Sex Object\" after song titles by the German electronic band Kraftwerk. All the band's albums are self-released. Critics cite the band's 1980s musical influences, particularly Devo.\n\n\n== Style ==\nThe Punk Group frequently criticize pop culture and other artists in their songs and are known for their politically incorrect lyrics.  \"We like to put people in their place and knock them down a few pegs, you know, make sure they don't get too big for their britches\", said one member. Their live shows consists of the two humans who sing and play guitar, bass, or synthesizer, and are known to wear assorted costumes, white sunglasses, and augmented by a drum machine.\n\n\n== Touring ==\nAlthough the band rarely played outside of Portland Oregon, they did embark on a European tour in the summer of 2007 and Australia in 2008. The Punk Group played their final Portland show at Dante's in May 2010 before relocating to San Francisco and Seattle, respectively. In 2012, they opened for Devo on numerous dates in California and performed an unofficial reunion at Dante's in August 2018.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nInternational Rock Stars (2003)\nTour De Force (2003)\nVideo Games (2005)\nRock Off and Fuck On (2005)\nThe Basement Tapes Vol. 1 (2006)\nThe Basement Tapes Vol. 2 (2006)\nMake a Rainbow With Your Hands (2007)\nSex, Drum Machines & Rock 'n Roll (2008)\nSelf Titled (2009)\nDifficult Listening (2010)\nPink Foam (2010)\nFruition (2015)\n\n\n== Tribute album ==\nShower Time!

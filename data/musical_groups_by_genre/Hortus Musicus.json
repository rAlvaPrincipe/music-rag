    "text": "Hortus Musicus is an Estonian ensemble that was established in 1972 by Andres Mustonen, a violin student of the Tallinn State Conservatory. Hortus Musicus specialises in performing early music, including 8th–15th-century European forms such as Gregorian Chant, Organum, Medieval Liturgic Hymns and Motets, the Franco-Flemish School, and Renaissance Music (including French chansons, villanelles and Italian madrigals). The group also presents early, non-European styles including Indian Ragas, Israeli temple songs, Arabian mughams and Jewish music. The group's repertoire has also included pieces by 20th-century composers (often created specially for Hortus Musicus, e.g. by Arvo Pärt).\nHortus Musicus has given concerts in the US, Turkey, Japan, and Israel, and has performed at several major early music festivals. They have recorded approximately 35 programmes, a portion of which is available from companies such as Erdenklang, Musica Svecia, Forte and Finlandia Records. The group's latest recording is \"Ave...\" (2005): 'music from the late Middle Ages in memoriam Helle Mustonen (1950–2005)'.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAndres Mustonen – leader, violin, viola, recorder, cromorn\nOlev Ainomäe – shawm, oboe, recorder, schalmey, cromorn, rauschpfeiff\nValter Jürgenson – sackbut\nTõnis Kuurme – curtal, shawm, baroque bassoon, recorder, cromorn, rauschpfeiff\nAnto Õnnis – tenor, percussion\nImre Eenma – violone, viola da gamba\nIvo Sillamaa – harpsichord, organ, piano\nTõnis Kaumann – baritone, percussion\nRiho Ridbeck – bass, percussion\nTaavo Remmel – double bass\n\n\n== Essential discography ==\n\n\n=== Vinyl Recordings released on \"Melodiya\" label (USSR) ===\n1975 — Gregorian chant / Early polyphony (Thousand years of music, vol.1) (Melodiya, S10-06499-00)\n1975 — \"Ludus Danielis\" (Thousand years of music, vol.2) (Melodiya, S10 07015-16)\n1977 — Italian secular music of the 14th c.

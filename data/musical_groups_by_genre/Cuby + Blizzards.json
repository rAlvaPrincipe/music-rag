    "text": "Cuby + Blizzards, also known as Cuby & the Blizzards, were a Dutch blues group, founded in 1964 by vocalist Harry Muskee and guitarist Eelco Gelling. During the 1960s, the band's mixture of sound, drawing upon a variety of genres which included blues and rock and roll, gave them a pioneering sound which was completely different from any other Dutch band in the same period. The spelling of the name varies, with 'Cuby' also written as 'QB' and the ampersand (&) also written as 'and' or '+' and the 'and' sometimes left out. The spelling 'Cuby + Blizzards' was used on the first albums.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCuby + Blizzards originated from the Drenthe village of Grolloo with members Harry Muskee (whose dog was called Cuby), Eelco Gelling, Nico Schröder and Hans Kinds.\nThe band's first single, a blues-based track bearing similarities to The Pretty Things output, was \"Stumble and Fall\" in 1965. They had their first top 40 hit with \"Back Home\" in the Netherlands 1966. In 1967 they toured with Van Morrison (after he had left Them), recorded an album, Praise the Blues with U.S. blues musician Eddie Boyd and scored a top 10 hit with \"Window of My Eyes\". That year, John Mayall stayed at their farm and the next year they regularly played with the 'king of British blues' Alexis Korner, who is featured on their album Live in Düsseldorf (1968). \nThe line-up of the band changed regularly, but founders Harry Muskee and Eelco Gelling remained at the core of the band until 1976. Herman Brood was the pianist from early 1967 until mid-1969 (which kickstarted his career) and again in 1976. Also in 1976, Gelling left to join Golden Earring. Muskee then decided to drop the name C+B and to form the Harry Muskee Band. This band recorded one album before Muskee decided to leave the music business. In 1980 he formed the Muskee Gang with a line-up of Herman Deinum (bass guitar) and Hans la Faille (drums), who had both joined C+B in 1969, together with saxophonist Rudy van Dijk, Paul Smeenk (guitar) and Jeff Reynolds (trumpet). \nAmong the best known songs released by the band were \"Another Day, Another Road\", \"Distant Smile\", \"Window of My Eyes\" and \"Appleknockers Flophouse\".\nIn 1996 Cuby + Blizzards re-formed without Eelco Gelling, who was replaced by Erwin Java on guitar. In 2004 they went on a theater tour to honor John Lee Hooker. C+B came to an end when Harry Muskee died of cancer on 26 September 2011.\nThe band received an Edison award for their debut album Desolation. The song \"Window of My Eyes\" (a Top 10 hit in The Netherlands in 1968), was featured over the ending credits for the 2010 film The American.\n\n\n== Line-ups ==\n\nEarly line-up\n\nHarry \"Cuby\" Muskee, vocals\nEelco Gelling, guitar\nHans Kinds, guitar (replaced by Herman Brood, piano)\nWilly Middel, bass (replaced by Jaap van Eik)\nHans Waterman, drums (replaced by Dick Beekman)\nLate sixties line-up\n\nHarry Muskee, vocals\nEelco Gelling, guitar\nHerman Deinum, bass guitar\nHans la Faille, drums\nHelmig van der Vegt, piano\n1983 – line-up\n\nHarry Muskee, vocals\nRudy Van Dijk, tenor sax\nPaul Smeenk, guitar\nHerman Deinum, bass\nHans Lafaille, drums\nJeff Reynolds, trumpet\nReunion line-up 1996–2011\n\nHarry Muskee, vocals\nErwin Java, guitar\nHerman Deinum, bass guitar\nHans la Faille, drums\nHelmig van der Vegt, piano\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nDesolation (1966)\nPraise The Blues (with Eddie Boyd) (1967)\nGroeten Uit Grollo (1967)\nTrippin' Thru' A Midnight Blues (1968)\nAppleknockers Flophouse (1969)\nToo Blind To See (1970)\nSimple Man (1971)\nSometimes (1972)\nRed White & Blue (1975)\nKid Blue (1976)\nForgotten Tapes (1979)\nDancing Bear (1998)\nHotel Grolloo (2000)\nBoom Boom Bang: In the Spirit of John Lee Hooker (2003)\nCats Lost (2009)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nLive '68 (1968)\nAfscheidsconcert (1974)\nOld Times, Good Times (1977)\nLive' Featuring Herman Brood Live (1979)\nTravelling with the Blues (1997)\nLive in het Oude Luxor (2005)\nGrollo Blues (2021)\n\n\n== References =="

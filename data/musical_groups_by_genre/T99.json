    "text": "T99 were a Belgian music group best known for their song \"Anasthasia\", which reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart in May 1991.\nT99 was initially Patrick DeMeyer, who released three solo works under this pseudonym. However, he heard Olivier Abbeloos (also of Quadrophonia) working on the track \"Anasthasia\", and suggested that they jointly release it as T99.\nFrom then on, T99 was a duo made up of de Meyer and Abbeloos. They experienced brief success with \"Anasthasia\" and the follow-up, \"Nocturne\".  Their only album release, Children of Chaos, contained seventeen tracks which varied from hardcore techno to ambient techno, along with a spoken-word performance art piece. Their sound was sampled in tracks by 2 Unlimited, Kylie Minogue, and The Chemical Brothers.\n\"Anasthasia\" appeared on the soundtrack to the 1999 film, Human Traffic.\nDe Meyer later went on to write material for Technotronic and 2 Unlimited, while Olivier Abbeloos started the label Holographic.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nChildren of Chaos (1992)\nComplete Works: The Best of T99 (2000)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nT99 at Discogs\nUK Top40 chart\nMusicmatic - for the release date\nSoundcloud - Olivier Abbeloos (aka T99)\nHolographic"

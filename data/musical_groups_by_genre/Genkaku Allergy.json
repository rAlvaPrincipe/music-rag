Genkaku Allergy disbanded in 1997, but in 2006 vocalist Sceana regrouped the band for one last show. In 2020, he resurrected the band as simply Genkaku (幻覚).\n\n\n== Band history ==\nIn 1992, following the end of Kamaitachi, Sceana and Kazzy started Genkaku Allergy. The same year their first EP, Mouth to Mouth, was released by Free-Will. This first work quickly climbed up the indie charts to the first position.

Nothing can justify bloodshed. Enough of ignoring the just clamor of a people suffocated by an intolerable crisis.\" \nIn 2019, in a speech accepting his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, he said that it should belong to Venezuela, and that \"tomorrow [23 Jan. 2019] is a crucial day [and] the voice of the masses must be heard and respected\", referring to the planned national protest on that date and the Venezuelan presidential crisis. In 2022, he returned to Venezuela and reconnected with family and friends as well as students and teachers at El Sistema. Speaking about El Sistema, Dudamel said, \"I have made it my personal mission not to rest until music is truly a fundamental human right for everyone. El Sistema has endured through seven different governments in Venezuela. It is not about politics. It is about the shared belief that art must be a part of the fabric of society\". He considered that the political situation in the country had improved but that there were still problems that needed to be addressed, saying: \"People have the desire to get out of this unrest — this political, ideological unrest — and really make things move forward\" and that “There has been a change, but we need to keep working to make things better because they are still very difficult.”\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDudamel has been married twice. His first marriage, in 2006, was to Eloísa Maturén in Caracas. Maturén, also a Venezuelan native, is a classically trained ballet dancer  and a journalist.

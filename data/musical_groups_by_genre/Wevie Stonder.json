    "text": "Wevie Stonder \nare a British group formed in Brighton in 1993. They have released 6 studio albums on Skam, Sonig and Cack Records. The band's name is a spoonerism of American R&B and soul musician Stevie Wonder.\n\n\n== History ==\nWevie Stonder first began making music in 1979 at the age of 6, by recording some chickens down an old army telephone onto a cassette recorder, accompanied by a 3 stringed acoustic guitar.\nThey regrouped in 1993 with an Amstrad Studio 100 4 track, Casio PT 82 and an electric bass to record a failed cover version of \"I Just Called To Say I love You\" and various other audio experiments, which were inserted into Brighton Music Library on side B of a Steve Reich cassette, complete with its own Dewey Decimal Number.\nTheir debut LP Eat Your Own Ears (whose name was later taken by the London-based promotions company) led them to release a series of records on the Skam and Sonig labels and perform at electronic music nights and festivals around the UK and Europe, creating some confusion in the electronic music world and a fad for spoonerised names.\nWevie Stonder have played over 70 European live shows and recorded sessions for BBC Radio 1 & 3, and continue to work on new music and art in many different guises.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nOn Skam Records\n\nEat Your Own Ears (2000)\nDrawing on Other People's Heads (2002)\nStoat (2002)\nKenyan Harry   EP (2003)\nThe Wooden Horse of Troy (2005)\nOn Sonig (as Wevie De Crepon)\n\nThe Age Old Age Of Old Age Mini LP  (2003)\nTon Wah 12 (2004)\nOn CACK Records\n\nThe Bucket (2009)\nSmall People / Shut the Gate (2009)\nThe Beast Of Wevie (2017)\nRemixes:\n\nThe man with the Xylophone skull (2001) for Rubin Steiner\nKing Holer (2002) for Fujiya & Miyagi\nPushchairs for grown ups (2004) for Team Doyobi\nA buddha made of mud (2007) for Schlammpeitziger\nRadio Sessions:\nBBC Radio 3 - \"Mixing it\" hosted by Robert Sandall and Mark Russell, broadcast 2/6/06\nBBC Radio 1 - \"Breezeblock\" Mary Anne Hobbs, broadcast 3/9/05\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nTon Wah"

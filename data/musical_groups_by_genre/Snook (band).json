    "text": "Snook (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈsnuːk]) is a Swedish rap group from Stockholm. The group consists of Oskar \"Kihlen\" Linnros and Daniel \"Danne\" Adams-Ray. The group often makes fun of traditional rap and tries to reinvent it. They have released two full-length albums and several singles.\nIn the 2006 MTV Europe Music Awards in Copenhagen, they won the award for Best Swedish Act.\nLinnros and Adams-Ray met in high school, Viktor Rydberg Gymnasium Odenplan. They formed Snook (snok is a Swedish slang term for \"nose\") in 2000. The group's first single 1990 nånting (Eng: \"1990 something\"), featuring Afasi & Filthy, became a big hit in Sweden. They were critically acclaimed because of their  different sound as compared to the general Swedish hip-hop. Their debut album Vi vet inte vart vi ska, men vi ska komma dit (Eng: \"We don't know where we're going, but we will get there\") was released in May 2004, and was one of the most praised records in Sweden that year. Snook received a P3 Guld award for their hit \"Mister Cool\" (Mr. Cool).\nThe group Snook is currently not active. Linnros has made a solo album called Vilja Bli (Want to Become); a move away from hip-hop, the album consists of ten soul-pop songs. It was released on 9 June 2010. Six months later, Adams-Ray released an album called Svart, Vitt och allt därimellan (Black, White and Everything in Between).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nCharting\n\nOthers\n2004: \"Lejonhjärta\" feat.

    "text": "Calling All Dawns is a classical crossover album by Christopher Tin released in 2009.  The album won two Grammys at the 53rd Grammy Awards for Best Classical Crossover Album and Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) for the song \"Baba Yetu\", the theme for the 2005 video game Civilization IV. The win marks the first time in history that a Grammy has been awarded to a composition written for a video game.\nThe album is a song cycle in three movements: day, night, and dawn (corresponding to life, death, and rebirth).\nTwelve songs are featured on the album, each sung in a different language. Many of the lyrics find their sources in important pieces of world literature, including excerpts of long works such as the Hebrew Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, and The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, and also smaller verses such as the Lord's Prayer, MƒÅori proverbs, and Japanese haiku. The album features a similarly diverse set of vocal traditions, including opera, Irish keening, and African choral music.\nThe UK premiere of Kia Hora Te Marino was in Bath Abbey on 10 May 2014, at a concert in aid of the Royal British Legion.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Shooters was a five-piece country music band founded in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. It consisted of Walt Aldridge (lead vocals, guitar), Gary Baker (bass guitar), Barry Billings (guitar), Chalmers Davis (keyboards), and Michael Dillon ([drums). They charted several times on the Billboard country charts between 1986 and 1989. The quintet's first four singles were to have been included on an album titled Going Against the Wind. 1989's Solid as a Rock included their highest-charting single, the number 13 \"Borderline\".\nAfter disbanding, Aldridge worked as a songwriter and record producer, while Baker joined songwriting partner Frank J. Myers to write John Michael Montgomery's 1994 hit single \"I Swear\", which was later covered by All-4-One as well. Baker and Myers also recorded one album as the duo Baker & Myers. Chalmers Davis died on September 14, 2024 aged 73.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References =="

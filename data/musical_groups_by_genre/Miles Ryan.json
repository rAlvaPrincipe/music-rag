    "text": "Miles Ryan VC (c. 1826 – January 1887) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.\nRyan was about 31 years old, and a drummer in the 1st Bengal European Fusiliers during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place for which he and James McGuire were awarded the VC.\n\nSerjeant J. McGuire, Drummer M. Ryan\nDate of Act of Bravery, 14th September, 1857\nAt the assault on Delhi on the 14th September, 1857, when the Brigade had reached the Cabul Gate, the 1st Fusiliers and 75th Regiment, and some Sikhs, were waiting for orders, and some of the Regiments were getting ammunition served out (three boxes of which exploded from some cause not clearly known, and two others were in a state of ignition), when Serjeant\nMcGuire and Drummer Ryan rushed into the burning mass, and, seizing the boxes,\n\nthrew them, one after the other, over the parapet into the water. The confusion consequent on the explosion was very great, and the crowd of soldiers and native followers, who did not know where the danger lay, were rushing into certain destruction, when Serjeant McGuire and Drummer Ryan, by their coolness and personal daring, saved the lives of many at the risk of their own.\nHe died in Bengal, British India in January 1887.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThe Register of the Victoria Cross (1981, 1988 and 1997)\nClarke, Brian D.

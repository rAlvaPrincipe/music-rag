    "text": "Hello Saferide is a Swedish twee pop band fronted by songwriter Annika Norlin. According to Norlin's MySpace, the stage name \"Hello Saferide\" was \"inspired by an intelligent bus driver in a drug-addicted small town, don't ask.\" The Swedish-language version of the band's biography identifies the town as Willimantic, Connecticut.\nBased on the Internet success of the song \"Highschool Stalker,\" Hello Saferide was signed to Razzia Records in 2005.\nIn 2007, Norlin released a Swedish-language album under the band name Säkert! (a phrase that means \"Yeah, right!\", but also \"Safe\"). The album won her two Grammis awards in 2008, for best female pop act and best lyrics. She was chosen by Matt Groening to perform at the edition of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival he was curating in May 2010 in Minehead, England.\nAnnika Norlin is a journalist, and has worked for several newspapers in Sweden. She has also hosted different radio shows at Sveriges Radio P3.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nas Hello Saferide\n\nas Säkert!\n\n\n=== EP/Singles ===\nas Hello Saferide\n\nas Säkert!\n\nFeatured in\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHello Saferide\nHello Saferide on MySpace\nRazzia Records Archived 2008-07-02 at the Wayback Machine\nLast.fm\nHello Saferide Archived 2011-07-17 at the Wayback Machine at The Indie Music Database"

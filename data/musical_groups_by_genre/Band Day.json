    "text": "Band Day refers to an annual marching band festival or competition, usually intended for high school bands.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHigh school marching bands are invited onto a university campus to rehearse with and play alongside the university marching band for a halftime show or exhibition performance. Band day may also be a competition, where high schools compete against each other, while the university bands play exhibition performances. Occasionally, the band day competition is hosted at a state fair, such as the Indiana State Fair Band Day held at the Indiana State Fair every August.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Indiana State Fair Band Day\".\n\"Oklahoma State Fair Band Day\".

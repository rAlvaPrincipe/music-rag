He was also a composer and musical arranger who is known for his band arrangements and original compositions. He spent his formative years and the first years of his career in the United Kingdom, when he was widely known as Ronnie Milne. He subsequently auditioned to join the Canadian Army as a musician, was accepted in the rank of sergeant, and immigrated to Canada in 1953.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nMilne was born in Surrey, England, and came from a family of musicians, his father at one point playing with the Paris Opera left school in 1935 at the age of 14 and, along with his older brother Douglas, joined a juvenile band and toured Britain for several years.

In 1942 he won first prize for a jazz composition at the Professional \"Jazz Jamboree\" for his composition \"October Mood\", which he later confessed he rather disliked. Milne trained at the Royal College of Music and played viola for some time in the London Symphony Orchestra\n\n\n=== The Stargazers ===\nMilne came to prominence in 1949 when he co-founded, in conjunction with Cliff Adams, Dick James, and others, the vocal group The Stargazers, which quickly came to enjoy commercial success.

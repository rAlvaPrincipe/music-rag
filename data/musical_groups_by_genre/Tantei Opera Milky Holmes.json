The existence of the project was officially revealed later in a special edition of Miru Miru Milky, a variety show starring the main voice actors, and confirmed by the Milky Holmes official website the next day. However, it was also announced that they need support from the fans to realize its production, meaning the project hasn't gotten greenlit for production yet.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site (in Japanese)\nTantei Opera Milky Holmes (anime) at Anime News Network's encyclopedia"

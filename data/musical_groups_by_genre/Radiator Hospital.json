    "text": "Radiator Hospital is an American indie rock band. Though songwriter Sam Cook-Parrott (vocals/guitar) is from Grand Rapids, Michigan, they are now based in Philadelphia. The rest of the current lineup is Cynthia Schemmer (guitar/vocals), Jon Rybicki (bass), and Jeff Bolt (drums). They have released six albums; two out of print lo-fi cassettes, and four LPs put out by Salinas Records.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter Sam Cook-Parrott's high school band ended, he started recording solo material with a four-track tape recorder. He named the project after an auto body shop in Grand Rapids. Radiator Hospital released their first full-length album in 2010 titled My Most Imaginary Friend.\nIn September 2012, after a few years of regional shows and some minimal touring, Cook-Parrott relocated to Philadelphia, moving into a house with members of Swearin' and other punk bands. This is where the current full band Radiator Hospital lineup settled, also featuring guitarist/vocalist Cynthia Schemmer, bassist Jon Rybicki, and drummer Jeff Bolt.\nTheir first official full-length, Something Wild, was released in the summer of 2013 on Salinas Records. It was recorded partially in the same lo-fi manner as earlier cassettes, but added a more studio honed production sound (provided by Swearin' guitarist/vocalist Kyle Gilbride) on the more energetic full-band songs.\nTheir next album Torch Song, also recorded with Gilbride, was released in 2014, and brought the band wider recognition.\nIn 2017 Radiator Hospital released Play the Songs You Like, which had been recorded by Jeff Zeigler.\nAnother album, Sings 'Music For Daydreaming', was released in early 2019. It was also recorded with Zeigler and is the first full length album credited to Radiator Hospital to be performed entirely by Cook-Parrott since 2011.\nOn May 25, 2023, Radiator Hospital released Can't Make Any Promises, which was recorded once again with Kyle Gilbride.\nRadiator Hospital's recorded output often features collaborations with other vocalists, such as Allison and Katie Crutchfield, Maryn Jones, and Elaiza Santos. Likewise Cook-Parrott has contributed to recordings by Waxahatchee, Japanese Breakfast and Allison Crutchfield.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nMy Most Imaginary Friend - Amanda Bynes Tapes, Cassette, MP3 (2010)\nNothin' In My Eyes - Lafayette Records, Cassette, MP3 (2011)\nSomething Wild - Salinas Records LP, MP3 (2013)\nTorch Song - Salinas Records, LP, MP3 (2014)\nPlay the Songs You Like - Salinas Records, LP, MP3 (2017)\nSings 'Music for Daydreaming' - Salinas Records, LP, MP3 (2019)\nCan't Make Any Promises - Salinas Records, LP, streaming (2023)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nI Want To Believe - Stupid Bag Records, 7\", MP3 (2011)\nCan You Feel My Heart Beating? - Amanda Bynes Tapes, Cassette, MP3 (2012) / Party Nogg, 7\", MP3 (2013)\nSome Distant Moon - Forward Records, 7\", MP3 (2012)\nMall of America - Double Double Whammy, Cassette, MP3 (2013) / Forward Records, 10\" EP, MP3 (2014)\nNew Depression (2020)\n\n\n=== Split releases ===\nSplit with Fred Thomas - Already Dead Tapes, Cassette, MP3 (2012)\nSplit with Kyle Kaos - Already Dead Tapes, Cassette, MP3 (2014)\nSplit with Krill, Ovlov, and LVL UP - Double Double Whammy and Exploding In Sound, 7\", MP3 (2014)\nSplit with Sorority Noise - Soft Speak Records, 7\", MP3 (2014)\nSplit with Martha - Specialist Subject Records, 7\", MP3 (2015)\nVisiting Waters #1 - Apollonian Sound, MP3 (2015)\nThe Great Thunder Radiator Hospital Wedding Album - Stupid Bag Records, LP, MP3 (2016)\n\n\n== References =="

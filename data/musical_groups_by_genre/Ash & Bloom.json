In early 2013, after parting ways with Garner, Ash & Bloom played a show in Port Perry, alongside singer-songwriter Stacey Kaniuk, a longtime friend of singer (and Order of Ontario recipient) Justin Hines. Hines attended the show and asked the duo to join him on his North American \"Vehicle of Change Tour\". From June to October 2013, Ash & Bloom traveled with Hines across North America. Following the tour, the duo signed with Toronto label Orange Lounge Recordings and JAD Media.\n\n\n== Ash & Bloom EP ==\nAsh & Bloom's self-titled EP was released November 2013, which featured 4 tracks written by McKenna and Bloemendal with Julie Crochetière and Karen Kosowski. An animated music video for the song \"Heaven Is A Ghost Town\" was released the same month.

The day after the album's release, the duo exclusively shared the video for \"Your Hero\" through Exclaim! magazine.  \nCBCMusic featured the song \"Manna for My Soul\" as their Song of the Week. Also in 2014, Ash & Bloom appeared with Basia Bulat, and The Wooden Sky, and opened for Christopher Cross at the Canadian National Exhibition.\nAt the 2015 Hamilton Music Awards, Let The Storm Come was nominated for Folk/Traditional Recording of the Year and Ash & Bloom was nominated for New Artist/Group of the Year.\nLet The Storm Come was released in Australia and New Zealand on February 6, 2015 through MGM Distribution.

Shelley left the group in 2016 and was replaced by Casey Johnson, who left several months later,  Cuthbert left the group in 2018 leaving the band as duo until they disbanded in 2019.  The band formed in 2011, originally as a trio known as Triple J, consisting of Cuthbert, Hamblett and Hensley. They auditioned for the ninth series of the British television music competition The X Factor where they met Shelley who joined the band at the judges' request. They were the tenth contestant eliminated and were subsequently signed to Sony Music subsidiary RCA Records. Their debut single \"Carry You\" was released in June 2013. Their self-titled debut studio album followed in October 2013 and peaked at number 6 on the UK Albums Chart.\nUnion J left RCA Records in April 2014 and signed with Epic Records. In the lead-up to the release of their second album You Got It All – The Album, the band released two singles: \"Tonight (We Live Forever)\" and \"You Got It All\". A new EP Who Would've Thought was released on 22 March 2019. Cuthbert left the band in 2018 leaving the group as a duo, they later disbanded in 2019.\nOn 31 January 2022 Union J confirmed they would be reforming to celebrate their tenth anniversary with Shelley and Cuthbert rejoining the group who respectively left in 2016 and 2018.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2011–2012: Formation and The X Factor ===\nIn 2007, Blair Dreelan of Alpha Dog Management met 14-year-old Josh Cuthbert, who was auditioning for the fourth series of The X Factor in front of judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh, Sharon Osbourne and Dannii Minogue. Cuthbert failed to progress to the bootcamp stage, but Dreelan believed that he looked like a pop star and was impressed by his voice: \"I began to sort of work with him on various little projects like just sort of recording stuff because I've got a recording studio in Swindon.\" In 2011, Cuthbert and Jaymi Hensley met whilst studying performing arts at the Sylvia Young Theatre School in Westminster and later decided to put a band together. Former jockey Jamie \"JJ\" Hamblett was later added to the group by Dreelan, and they named themselves Triple J (due to each member sharing the same initial).\nIn May 2012, after eight months together, Triple J and soloist George Shelley both auditioned in London for the ninth series of The X Factor in front of judges Walsh, Gary Barlow, Tulisa and Nicole Scherzinger. Triple J performed Rihanna's international hit \"We Found Love\", whilst George covered an acoustic version of Britney Spears' \"Toxic\" – in which he also incorporated his guitar. Both acts progressed to the next stage of the competition, receiving positive critique from all judges present. Bootcamp saw Shelley perform Labrinth's \"Earthquake\", competing against female contestants; Charlie Cammish and Meg O'Neill. Triple J first sang Maroon 5's \"Moves Like Jagger\", before contending for the final place at judges' houses with GMD3 (later District3). They covered Chris Brown's \"Yeah 3x\", but were sent home after GMD3 were eventually chosen for judges' houses. However, following Rough Copy's forced withdrawal from the show, Dreelan was contacted by The X Factor producers with an offer for the group to return, on the basis that Shelley was added to the three-piece. All parties accepted the offer and the band – now a four-piece – became Union J and advanced to judges' houses alongside fellow recalled Times Red in the groups category, mentored by Walsh. The band's first performance as a four-piece was an acoustic cover of Carly Rae Jepsen's \"Call Me Maybe\". Walsh put them through to the live shows alongside District3 and MK1, and they instantly proved popular with social media users.\nIn week 1 of the live shows, Union J performed Queen's \"Don't Stop Me Now\". Despite negative feedback from the other judges, they progressed through to the next week after placing fourth in voting statistics behind Christopher Maloney, Jahméne Douglas and Ella Henderson, respectively. In week 4, the group received the fewest public votes with Jade Ellis, but were saved by Barlow, Scherzinger and Walsh. They found themselves in the bottom two again in week 6, against District3, but were saved for a second time by Barlow and Scherzinger, with Walsh refusing to vote between his acts. Union J were in the bottom two for a third time in the quarter-final, where they were saved by Walsh, Barlow and Tulisa over Rylan Clark. They were eliminated in the semi-final on 2 December. It was later reported that their winning single would have been a cover of Demi Lovato's \"Skyscraper\", which is featured on their debut album.\n\n\n=== 2013–2014: Union J and You Got It All ===\nUnion J first announced that they had signed a record deal with Sony Music Entertainment at a performance in Cardiff, Wales, on 15 December 2012.

Jaymi said, \"Very exciting, we're about to start recording our second studio album, which is massive. And then I think we're going to write on the album as well, work with some new producers.\" Josh also said that they hope to \"find that lane that [they] want to go down.\" They also revealed that they felt there was pressure on them to match the huge success of One Direction, as Louis Walsh had expected them to have a number-one single. The band also revealed that they did write songs for their debut album which ultimately failed to make the final cut, but hoped to have more self-penned tracks on their second album. Hensley told Digital Spy, \"We did write for [their first] album and we'd done about 14 songs but they didn't go on the album, maybe because they weren't right. The thing about writing is it's personal but also the more practice you get, the better you get.\"\nOn 5 April, Cuthbert announced via Twitter that Union J had left RCA and signed a new deal with Epic Records. The first single to be taken from the band's second album is \"Tonight (We Live Forever)\", which was released on 17 August 2014.

Cuthbert told The Sun:\n\n\"The music industry is really difficult. It plays with your emotions, it's ups and downs and you go through different managers. Over the last few years we’ve had different managers and we've been promised the world and been let down. We've got a label now which are great and I respect them lots and have nothing but good words to say about them, but it is difficult when you change members.\nGeorge obviously left, which was hard for us, but everyone has different reasons and has different things going on. Now that I'm making this decision myself I understand why George made that decision two years ago.\nAt the time you don't really get it, until you have the same feelings as him, which I now have. I spoke to them on the phone and I just hope that they support me, I want to stay friends with the boys, I love them.\"\n\nThe remaining members of Union J released their third and final single from Who Would've Thought, called \"Paralysed\", on 14 December 2018, with a video appearing on their YouTube channel on 25 January 2019.

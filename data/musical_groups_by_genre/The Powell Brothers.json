The brothers love performing live and meeting fans in big cities and small towns from coast to coast. Through relentless touring, they have garnered a vast and diverse following.   \nThe Powell Brothers are 6th generation Texans born and raised in Houston, Texas. Embracing the independent spirit of the Lone Star State, the brothers started their own record label, management company, and booking agency. Together, Taylor and Blake boldly blaze their own trail in the music industry. Blake Powell states “We love that we control all aspects of our business. If we’re ever looking for someone to blame, we can just look in the mirror.” Taylor Powell adds “The best part about being independent, and doing it yourself, is that you form strong relationships with people in every facet of the music industry. In most cases, what begins as a working relationship develops into a very close, personal relationship. We refer to the talent buyers, booking agents, artist managers, label representatives, and other industry professionals we work with as ‘family’...because they are.”   \nThe road has not been easy for Taylor and Blake. In 2017, the floodwaters of Hurricane Harvey destroyed their family home in Kingwood, Texas. The brothers found themselves, once again, living out of their car. In 2020, the Coronavirus pandemic forced the live music industry to shut down and left The Powell Brothers, and all of their industry peers, without work. On March 15, 2022, Taylor and Blake lost their father and best friend, Dr. Billy Powell. Dr. Powell was a leader, advisor, confidant, and source of constant encouragement and inspiration. He believed that his sons would achieve everything they set out to do in the music business; Taylor and Blake aim to prove their father right.  \nDespite the many challenges the brothers have faced over the years, Taylor and Blake never wavered in their commitment to one another, their commitment to the fans, and their commitment to the music. The Powell Brothers have displayed the unique ability to turn life’s challenges into opportunities. For example, when the world shut down during the Coronavirus pandemic, Taylor and Blake forged ahead by building a state-of-the-art live stream studio in their barn. The brothers hosted a bi-weekly live stream concert series called \"5 at 5.” Thousands of online viewers joined The Powell Brothers in their barn studio for the weekly concerts. Taylor and Blake also invited fellow artists to use the space. For example, Cody Johnson and Zane Williams of The Wilder Blue both performed live stream concerts at the barn studio.  \nThe Powell Brothers take great pride in the fact that they were born and raised in Texas; Kingwood, Texas to be specific. The group represents the Lone Star state everywhere they play. From stages in Bozeman, Montana to Baltimore, Maryland, Taylor Powell kicks off every show by playfully announcing to the crowd \"We are The Powell Brothers...from right down the road in Houston, Texas!\" The brothers have shared the stage with Texas legends like Gary P. Nunn, Tracy Byrd, Mark Chesnutt, Pat Green, Jack Ingram, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and Cory Morrow. The group has performed at iconic Texas venues like Luckenbach, Texas, Floore's Country Store, Gruene Hall, Brewster Street Icehouse, The Blue Light Live, Schroeder Hall, and Goode Company Armadillo Palace. Bonda fide Texans indeed, it is no surprise that The Powell Brothers spend a lot of time on the rodeo circuit. The group has entertained crowds at the National Finals Rodeo, Houston Rodeo, San Antonio Rodeo, Fort Worth Rodeo, and Rodeo Austin. The Powell Brothers also found a home in the Texas music festival and special event scene. The group has performed at Larry Joe Taylor's Texas Music Festival, Sweet Beats Music Festival, Fiesta Oyster Bake, Way Out West Fest, Texas Forever Fest, WindFest, Shiner Music Fest, and more.  \nNationally, The Powell Brothers have performed at major music festivals and special events including the Oregon Jamboree (Sweet Home, OR), Sweet Beats Music Fest (Sugar Land, TX), Highway 30 Music Fest (Filer, ID), Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo (Houston, TX), Sweet Pea Festival (Bozeman, MT), Merchants and Music Festival (Fort Thomas, KY), New Mexico State Fair (Albuquerque, NM), Rocky Mountain Country Festival (Keystone, CO), Oyster Ridge Music Festival (Kemmerer, WY), Chinook Fest (Naches, WA), Corn Palace Festival (Mitchell, SD), and many more.   \nWhen asked about The Powell Brothers’ explosive growth and what the future holds, Taylor Powell responds “It all boils down to good songs and good people. We are committed to the craft of songwriting. Our goal is to make every song and every album better than the last, and to surround ourselves with the best people.” Blake Powell echoes his brother’s thoughts and adds “Our goal is to deliver recorded music and live performances worthy of the love and support we are so blessed to receive.\"   \nFor more information on The Powell Brothers, including a full list of tour dates, links to recorded music, live music videos, merchandise and more, please visit the band's official website at www.PowellBrothersMusic.com\n\n\n== Members ==\nTaylor Powell (Lead Vocals, Guitar & Bass)\nBlake Powell (Guitar, Bass & Backing Vocals)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nofficial website www.PowellBrothersmusic.com"

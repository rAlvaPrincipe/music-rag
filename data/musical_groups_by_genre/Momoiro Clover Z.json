    "text": "Momoiro Clover Z (ももいろクローバーZ, Momoiro Kurōbā Zetto) is a Japanese idol girl group, commonly abbreviated as MCZ or Momoclo (ももクロ, Momokuro).\nThe four members of MCZ are known for energetic performances, incorporating elements of ballet, gymnastics, and action movies.\nMCZ is notable for being the first female group to hold a solo concert at National Olympic Stadium in Japan, as well as providing theme music for anime television series such as Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball, and Pokémon.\nIn 2013, the group grossed the fourth highest total sales revenue by a music artist in Japan, with over ¥5.2 billion. During 2016, about 636,000 people attended their live concerts, the most ever for a Japanese female group. MCZ was ranked as the most popular female Japanese group from 2013 to 2018, and 2020 to 2022.\nMCZ has collaborated with other performers, including a 2015 recording with American hard rock band KISS, marking KISS's first collaborative recording. In 2016, their first overseas tour titled Trans America Ultra Live was held in Hawaii, Los Angeles, and New York. They sold more than 3 million physical copies in Japan.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nOn stage, Momoiro Clover Z members are easily distinguished by the colors of their clothes, similar to the characters from Super Sentai or Power Rangers. In some songs and music videos, the group loosely parodies them.\n\nBefore the group made its debut, other girls were in the lineup: Sumire Fujishiro, Manami Ikura, Yukina Kashiwa (later a member of Nogizaka46), Tsukina Takai (later became a member of SKE48), Miyū Wagawa, and Runa Yumikawa.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2008–2009: Conception and beginnings ===\nThe group was formed in the spring of 2008 as a 5-member unit, originally named Momoiro Clover (\"Pink Clover\" or, literally, \"Peach-Colored Clover\"). The name was chosen to imply that the group was composed of innocent girls who wanted to bring happiness to people. Ariyasu Momoka joined the group after their first single. Later in 2011, after the departure of Akari Hayami from the group, management added the letter \"Z\" to the group's name. The group's slogan is \"Idols you can meet right now\" (いま、会えるアイドル, Ima, aeru aidoru).\nMomoiro Clover began as a street act in 2008, performing for bystanders in Tokyo's Yoyogi Park. As most members were students attending school on weekdays, the group was active mainly on weekends, leading them to be nicknamed \"Weekend Heroines\" (週末ヒロイン, Shūmatsu Hiroin). In a one-year period, Momoiro Clover had a number of line-up changes. In March 2009, they became a five-member unit composed of Reni Takagi, Kanako Momota, Akari Hayami, Shiori Tamai, and Ayaka Sasaki.\nTo support and promote their first indie single, \"Momoiro Punch\", Momoiro Clover took advantage of school holidays from May to August and went by minibus on a long tour across Japan. They gave a total of 104 concerts in 24 electronic stores of the Yamada Denki network. The girls slept in the minivan, and group's managers drove. In the middle of the tour, Momoka Ariyasu was added to the group as a sixth member. The single was sold only at the group's live events and those sales were enough for it to place 11th in the Oricon Daily Singles Chart and 23rd in the weekly chart.\n\n\n=== 2010: Major debut ===\nIn March 2010, the girls stated their goals: to take first place on Oricon, to participate in Kōhaku Uta Gassen, to perform at Budokan. They usually performed in a small club with live music or on a roof of a department store. They sometimes set a simulated stage of National Olympic Stadium, where notable musicians are allowed to perform.\nTheir first major-label single \"Ikuze! Kaitō Shōjo\" was released in May. The single debuted on Japan's Oricon Daily Singles Chart at the first position, and at number 3 for the week. Momoiro Clover then moved to King Records. The group's first single with King was \"Pinky Jones\", composed by Narasaki from the Japanese rock band Coaltar of the Deepers with a \"more chaotic\" approach than previous songs. December 24 marked Momoiro Clover's first solo concert at a concert hall. Nihon Seinenkan, a venue with a capacity of 1,300 seats, was sold out in 30 minutes.\n\n\n=== 2011: Shift to Momoiro Clover \"Z\" ===\n\nIn January 2011 at the release event for a new song, sub-leader Akari Hayami stated that she had decided to withdraw from the group in April. Hayami explained that her character was not suited to being an idol and that her dream was to become an actress. At the April 10 Akari Hayami \"graduation\" concert, the group's management announced the name change to Momoiro Clover Z after Hayami's departure. In Japan, Z(ゼット) symbolizes ultimateness and this letter is often appended to a  title (e.g., Mazinger Z and Dragon Ball Z). Z is officially pronounced as  (British pronunciation) when the name is used in spoken English. The band has gone on record saying in an interview that the Z in the title is a reference to the famous anime series, Dragon Ball Z stating \"The Z in our name is a very obvious reference to Dragon Ball Z\" and that \"It's a awesome and very influential series\".\nMomoiro Clover Z's first single after Hayami's departure was \"Z Densetsu: Owarinaki Kakumei\", accompanied by a new group image and stage performance. The girls wore outfits with helmets and so-called \"transformation belts\" reminiscent of Japanese superhero movies, and the music video also borrowed from such \"Super Sentai\" imagery. In July, Momoiro Clover Z released their first album, Battle and Romance. Later in December, Hotexpress described the band as the number-one breakthrough idol artist of 2011 and stated that the album became a big turning point for them. Next February, Battle and Romance won the Grand Prix at the CD Shop Awards as the best CD of the year selected by music shop employees from all over the country. Momoiro Clover Z was the first idol group to win the award. On Christmas Day, 2011, Momoiro Clover Z gave a concert at Saitama Super Arena to their biggest audience to date: all 10,000 tickets were sold out.\n\n\n=== 2012: Rising popularity in Japan ===\nIn May 2012, Momoiro Clover Z performed in Putrajaya, Malaysia. The former Prime Minister, Najib Razak, personally greeted the group. In June, Momoiro Clover Z opened a national tour, which closed with a sold-out show at Seibu Dome in August to a capacity crowd of 37,000 fans. Both dates were broadcast live to selected cinemas across Japan, the latter also to Taiwan and Hong Kong.\n\nThe group recorded an ending theme song for Pokémon's Best Wishes series (titled \"Mite Mite Kocchichi\" and included in the eighth single \"Otome Sensō\" as a coupling track). In July, Momoiro Clover Z performed at Japan Expo 2012 in Paris.\nMomoiro Clover Z's ninth single \"Saraba, Itoshiki Kanashimitachi yo\", which appeared in November, topped the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart, becoming their first single to do so. They contributed to the anime Joshiraku with \"Nippon Egao Hyakkei\" as the ending theme which was released on 5 September with a prior early release in iTunes Japan on 22 August.\nOn December 31, Momoiro Clover Z performed at Kōhaku Uta Gassen, an annual New-Year-Eve music show hosted by NHK, for the first time. Going to Kōhaku had been the group's goal for a long time.  During the January 1 Ustream broadcast, Momoiro Clover Z made several announcements: that the band set a new goal for itself — to give a concert at the National Olympic Stadium, an arena with 60–70,000 capacity, that they would release a new album in spring, and that Momoka Ariyasu had to undergo a throat treatment and she would not sing or even talk until the end of January. The treatment was subsequently prolonged for another month, until the end of February. During the group's live Ustream broadcasts, Momoka communicated by drawing and writing on a markerboard. At live performances, other members took turns in singing her parts.\n\n\n=== 2013: 5th Dimension ===\nMomoiro Clover Z's second full-length album 5th Dimension was released in April. It sold 180,000 copies in the first week and debuted on top of the Oricon charts, with the first album Battle and Romance resurging to number two. Finally, it won a platinum disk award. In August, Momoiro Clover Z held a concert at Nissan Stadium. It has the largest capacity in Japan.\n\n\n=== 2014: Dream come true ===\nIn March, the group held a solo concert at National Olympic Stadium, realizing one of their dreams since the debut. Such solo concerts had only been performed by six groups until then. Momoiro Clover Z was the first female group and also became the fastest group ever, which achieved that in six years. As a two-day concert, a total of 150,000 people watched in the stadium and at live viewing venues.\nIn May, the group released their 11th single \"Naite mo Iin Da yo\"; B-side \"My Dear Fellow\" made its debut at Yankee Stadium when it was used for Masahiro Tanaka's warm up for his first game with the New York Yankees. The group also provided the theme music for the anime Sailor Moon Crystal. The title is \"Moon Pride\" (the group's 12th single released in July).\nIn August, the group performed at Lady Gaga's concert as an opening act. It was a part of Gaga's world tour named \"ArtRave: The Artpop Ball\" and held in Japan. Momoiro Clover Z was selected by Gaga herself.\n\n\n=== 2015: Collaboration with KISS ===\nOn January 28, 2015, Momoiro Clover Z released a collaboration single with the American hard rock band KISS, titled \"Yume no Ukiyo ni Saitemina\". It was the first time for KISS to release a collaboration CD with another artist. In Japan, it was released physically in two versions: Momoiro Clover Z edition (CD+Blu-ray) and KISS edition (CD only). An alternate mix of the single's title song was also included as an opening track on the Japanese-only SHM-CD album Best of KISS 40, released in Japan on the same day.\nIn February 2015, a joint performance recorded by Momoiro Clover Z and Rats & Star for the Fuji TV show Music Fair was removed from broadcast due to controversy over the appearance of both groups in blackface in the performance, a photo of which Rats & Star had tweeted before the broadcast date after recording. A Change.org petition had been started after the tweet by Japan Times contributor Baye McNeil, who is African American, amid conversations over racism in Japan. Amid the controversy, Momoiro Clover Z cancelled their appearance at a Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan film screening.\nMomoiro Clover Z provided the theme song, \"Z no Chikai\" which was released as their fifteenth single on April 29, 2015, for the Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' theatrical anime film. The group also voiced the Angels at the end of the film.\n\n\n=== 2016: Amaranthus/Hakkin no Yoake and Trans America Ultra Live ===\nThe group released their third studio album Amaranthus and fourth studio album Hakkin no Yoake in a double release in Japan on February 17, 2016. The albums debuted at #1 and #2 in the Oricon weekly albums chart. The group held a dome trek tour for the two albums.\nIn early April 2016, the group announced their first overseas tour titled Trans America Ultra Live and appeared in Hawaii, Los Angeles and New York\n\n\n=== 2017: MTV Unplugged ===\n\n\n=== 2018: 10th Anniversary Best Album ===\nOn January 21, Momoka Ariyasu graduated from the group, leaving MCZ with only four members. In April, they released their 18th single, \"Xiao yi Xiao\". On May 23, they released a new best of album for their tenth anniversary called Momo mo Juu, Bancha mo Debana.\n\n\n=== 2019–2021: Self-Titled Album ===\nOn May 17, 2019, Momoiro Clover Z released their self-titled fifth studio album, their first studio album to not feature Momoka Ariyasu and their first as a four-member group. In 2021, they performed the theme song for the Sailor Moon Eternal movie.\n\n\n=== 2021–2022: Shukuten ===\n\n\n=== 2023–present: Idola ===\n\n\n== Music style ==\n\nThe band's songs are intentionally ridiculous \"hyperactive J-pop numbers\". Their live performances are heavily choreographed and feature acrobatic stunts. The group is noted for their \"anarchic energy\" that is similar to that of punk bands. The response from the audience has been characterised as \"seismic\".\nSome of Momoiro Clover's works are quite complex, switching from one musical style to another during one song and connecting \"seemingly unconnected melodies\". The group has worked with many noted songwriters and musicians, belonging to different genres of music, from pop to punk and heavy metal.  Overall, the group and its music has been noted as progressive and forward-thinking. Ian Martin from The Japan Times dubbed Momoiro Clover \"a pop group who provoke squealing, teenage admiration from punks, indie kids, noise musicians and heavy-psychedelic longhairs throughout the Japanese underground music scene\".  Momoiro Clover \"is known for upbeat tunes, eccentric choreography and the members' costumes\". A music critic from The Japan Times cites Momoiro Clover as an example of \"a seamless integration of personality, image, and music, with each element mutually complementary\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nBattle and Romance (2011)\n5th Dimension (2013)\nAmaranthus (2016)\nHakkin no Yoake (2016)\nMomoiro Clover Z (2019)\nShukuten (2022)\nIdola (2024)\n\n\n== Collaboration ==\nMomoiro Clover Z have collaborated with overseas artists.\n\nKiss released a collaboration single with Momoiro Clover Z, titled \"Yume no Ukiyo ni Saitemina\" (January 2015).\nLady Gaga designated Momoiro Clover Z for an opening act of  her concert (August 2014).\nMarty Friedman participated as a guitarist in \"Mōretsu Uchū Kōkyōkyoku Dai 7 Gakushō \"Mugen no Ai\"\" (March 2012) and \"Moon Pride\" (July 2014).\nYngwie Malmsteen participated as a guitarist in \"Mōretsu Uchū Kōkyōkyoku Dai 7 Gakushō \"Mugen no Ai\" -Emperor Style-\" (June 2014).\nThe group sings the theme music for the following anime.\n\nYosuga no Sora - \"Pinky Jones\" (November 2010)\nDragon Crisis! - \"Mirai Bowl\" (January 2011)\nBodacious Space Pirates - \"Mōretsu Uchū Kōkyōkyoku Dai 7 Gakushō \"Mugen no Ai‍\"\" (March 2012)\nPokémon - \"Mite Mite Kocchichi\" (June 2012)\nJoshiraku - \"Nippon Egao Hyakkei\" (June 2012) in collaboration with Yoshida Brothers\nPretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal - \"Moon Pride\", \"Moon Rainbow\" (月虹, Gekkō) (July 2014)\nPretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal Season III - \"Fall in Love with a New Moon\" (ニュームーンに恋して, Nyū Mūn ni Koishite) (June 2016)\nPretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal The Movie - \"Moon Color Chainon\" (月色Chainon, Tsukiiro Chainon) (January 2021, with main voice actresses: Kotono Mitsuishi, Hisako Kanemoto, Rina Sato, Ami Koshimizu, and Shizuka Ito)\nDragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' - \"Z no Chikai (April 2015)\nCrayon Shin-chan: Burst Serving!

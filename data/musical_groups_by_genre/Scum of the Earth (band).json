    "text": "Scum of the Earth is an American industrial metal band. The band was formed in 2003 by musicians associated with Rob Zombie, who temporarily set aside his music career to focus on writing and directing movies. They have released three albums and eight singles.\nScum of the Earth had an initial lineup of Mike Riggs (lead vocalist, guitarist), brothers Mike (guitarist) and John Tempesta (drummer), as well as Clay Campbell (bassist). Riggs is the only musician in the band its entire history.\nThe band's name comes from a 1978 episode of the television series WKRP in Cincinnati. The Hoodlum Rock episode is about a concert being promoted at the station, of a \"hoodlum rock\" band called Scum of the Earth. The name also borrows from the Rob Zombie single \"Scum of the Earth\" that was originally featured in the soundtrack to the 2000 action film Mission: Impossible II and Zombie's 2001 album The Sinister Urge.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent\n\nRiggs – vocals, guitar (2003–present)\nEddie Travis – drums, percussion (2011–present)\nNick Mason – bass (2011–present)\nFormer\n\nMike Tempesta – guitar (2003–2005)\nJohn Tempesta – drums, percussion (2003–2006)\nClay Campbell – bass (2003–2007)\nSkyla Talon – guitar (2005–2008)\nBrandon Workman – bass (2007–2010)\nDan Laudo – drums (2007–2010)\nJesse Saint – guitar (2008–2013)\nJohn Dolmayan – drums (2004)\nIvan de Prume – drums (2006–2007)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\n2004: Blah...Blah...Blah...Love Songs for the New Millennium\n2007: Sleaze Freak\n2012: The Devil Made Me Do It\nSingles\n\n2013: \"Zombie Apocalypse\" (featuring Volkstroker)\n2013: \"The Devil Made Me Do It 3\" (featuring Volkstroker)\n2013: \"Born Again Masochist\" (featuring Exageist)\n2017: \"Dance Motherf***er\"\n2020: \"Bigfoot and the Armies of Puma Punka\"\n2022: \"Ziggurats Of Mesopotamia\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Facebook page\nScum of the Earth at AllMusic \nMK Magazine review\nBand biography at EclipseRecords.com"

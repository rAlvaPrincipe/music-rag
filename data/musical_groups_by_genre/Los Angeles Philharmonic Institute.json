    "text": "The Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute was a summer training program held in Los Angeles, California for conservatory aged orchestral instrumentalists and conductors.  It ran from 1982 to 1991 under the auspices of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute was founded by Ernest Fleischmann and Leonard Bernstein, with Bernstein and Daniel Lewis serving as artistic directors.  Subsequent artistic directors have included Michael Tilson Thomas, Sir Charles Groves, André Previn, Lukas Foss, and finally Lynn Harrell (1988–1992).\nMost of the faculty were musicians from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, but also included many other prominent musicians, including Vladimir Spivakov, Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, Erich Leinsdorf, Edo de Waart, Leonard Slatkin, and Jesús López-Cobos, among others.\nThe Institute was notable for the amount of daily, hands-on instruction students received from faculty, even when compared to other similar summer programs, such as Tanglewood.  Lynn Harrell said, \"Not only do the students have an almost daily open working situation with Philharmonic players, but they'll have the opportunity to join them in performance [at the Hollywood Bowl]....  To sit next to experienced orchestra musicians and play with that kind of immediacy is worth a thousand words. There's a give-and-take here on many levels.\"\nIn December 1991, Fleischmann announced that the 1992 Institute would be cancelled due to budget cuts by the Philharmonic.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\n\n=== Conducting Fellows ===\nGisele Ben-Dor\nThomas Dausgaard\nPaavo Järvi\nYakov Kreizberg\nJahja Ling\nKeith Lockhart\nDavid Alan Miller\nKeith Lockhart\nEiji Oue\nStefan Sanderling\nToshiyuki Shimada\nMichael Stern\nMario Venzago\nLeif Bjaland\nWilliam Eddins\n\n\n=== Strings ===\nCarolyn Waters Broe\nTatjana Mead Chamis (Associate Principal Viola, Pittsburgh Symphony)\nBen Hong (Associate Principal Cello, Los Angeles Philharmonic)\nIngrid Hutman (Viola, Los Angeles Philharmonic)\nEric Lee (Associate Concertmaster, Kennedy Center Opera House Orchestra)\nCharles Bingham, Solista Bilbao Symphony Orchestra since 1995- current.\nJosefina Vergara (Principal Second Violin, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra)\nGlen Wanner (Assistant Principal Bass, Nashville Symphony)\n\n\n=== Woodwinds ===\nSue Heineman (Principal Bassoon, National Symphony)\nMarni Hougham, (English horn, Minnesota Orchestra)\nSusan McGinn (Principal Flute, Honolulu Symphony)\nTheodore Soluri, (Principal Bassoon, Dallas Symphony)\nPhilip Dikeman, (Former Acting Principal Flute, Detroit Symphony, Associate Professor Vanderbilt University)\nMichael Lisicky, (Oboe, Baltimore Symphony)\nNancy Ambrose King, (Professor of Oboe, University of Michigan)\nLee Livengood, (Bass clarinet, Utah Symphony)\n\n\n=== Brass ===\nElizabeth Cook-Shen (former Horn, Los Angeles Philharmonic)\nDai Zhonghui (Principal Trumpet, National Symphony Orchestra of China)\nMatthew Guilford (Bass Trombone, National Symphony)\nBrian Rood (Trumpet, Kansas City Symphony)\nDavid Washburn (Principal Trumpet, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Living in a Box are a British band founded in 1985. The group's 1987 eponymous debut single reached  No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart and was a top-20 hit in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100. Their 1989 single \"Room in Your Heart\" reached  No. 5 in the UK. \nThe group, which formerly included vocalist Richard Darbyshire, currently consists of founding members Anthony \"Tich\" Critchlow (drums) and Marcus Vere (keyboards, synthesizers) along with new vocalist Bryan Chambers.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Formation and split ===\nLiving in a Box were formed in 1985 in Sheffield. The group named themselves after the first song they had recorded together in the studio. Vere and Critchlow were recording the demo version of the tune in a studio also being visited by Richard Darbyshire, an independent recording artist at the time. Darbyshire was invited to join his two future bandmates in the studio to record vocals for the track, and the three officially became a band.\nReleased two years later, \"Living in a Box\" was their most commercially successful single, peaking at #5 on the UK Singles Chart and became the band's only single to chart in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. The single was featured on the group's self-titled debut album, which also included follow-up singles \"Love is the Art\", \"So the Story Goes\", and \"Scales of Justice\". While \"So the Story Goes\" was the only one of these additional singles to reach the US Billboard Hot 100, all three songs charted in their home country.\nTheir follow-up album, Gatecrashing in 1989 proved to be even more successful in the UK, generating two top-10 hits, \"Blow the House Down\" (which featured Queen's Brian May on guitar) and \"Room in Your Heart\". The album itself peaked at #21. Artistic differences, as well as changes to their record label Chrysalis, caused the band to break up in 1990 before a third album could be released.\n\n\n=== After Living in a Box ===\nFrontman Richard Darbyshire has continued his long-standing music career, writing songs for artists such as Lisa Stansfield and briefly enjoying modest success as a solo artist. His solo album, How Many Angels (1994) has been re-released a number of times (beginning in 1999, when it was re-issued under the title of Love Will Provide) accompanied by various new and unreleased tracks.\nAnthony \"Tich\" Critchlow and Marcus Charles Vere temporarily retired from the music industry after the band split. Critchlow runs his own company providing bespoke illumination and lighting installations.\nAfter a brief break, Vere changed direction and produced an award-winning series of educational DVDs called Here Comes A...! for pre-school aged children. The business moved online in early 2017 as Kids Trucks TV. In May 2016, Vere was credited with writing the songs \"Viva Love\", \"Flames of Desire\", \"Kiss Me Goodbye\" and \"Ten Below Zero\" on the Top 5 ABC album Lexicon of Love II.\n\n\n=== Living in a Box reform ===\nIn 2016, Living in a Box reformed with British soul singer Kenny Thomas replacing Darbyshire. In summer 2022, they announced via Twitter that they have a new singer, Bryan Chambers. Since they have reformed, the band has appeared at live festival events in the UK such as Let's Rock, Rewind and Flashback.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nThe song \"Living in a Box\" was later covered by Bobby Womack, who had also worked with Living in a Box on the single, \"So the Story Goes\". In 2013 the song \"Living In A Box\" was featured in the video game Grand Theft Auto V.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCurrent members\n\nAnthony \"Tich\" Critchlow – drums (1985–1990, 2016–present)\nMarcus Charles Vere  – keyboards, synthesizers (1985–1990, 2016–present)\nBryan Chambers – vocals (2022–present)\nPast members\n\nRichard Darbyshire – vocals, guitar (1985–1990)\nKenny Thomas – vocals (2016–2022)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nRichard Darbyshire official website\nDiscogs.com entry\nLiving in a Box biography and discography at AllMusic website"

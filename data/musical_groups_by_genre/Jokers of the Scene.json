    "text": "Jokers of the Scene, composed of Linus Booth (also known as DJ Booth), and Chris Macintyre (also known as Chameleonic), are a Canadian Techno/Electronic production and DJ duo.\n\n\n== History ==\nBooth and Macintyre formed Jokers of the Scene in Ottawa, Ontario in 2003 as loft party disc jockeys; they played their own recorded tracks and remixes, as well as hosting other local rappers.\nJokers of the Scene evolved into a full-time partnership after signing a recording deal with Fool's Gold Records in 2007. They later moved to Toronto, where Spinner Magazine reported on their party organizing and remixing, noting their \"early '90s techno-influenced DJing style.\"\nIn 2009 the pair's track \"Change Up\" appeared on the BeatPort chart.\nIn 2011, Britain's NME Magazine voted their remix of Salem's \"Asia\" #19 on their \"50 Best Remixes Ever\" list. In 2012 the pair released an EP, J0T5, which included tracks in a variety of styles. Their 2014 album, End Scene, was a change from their earlier heavy electro music to a more experimental sound.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nEnd Scene (2014)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nY’all Know the Name - EP (2008)\nAcid Bag (2008)\nBaggy Bottom Boys (2009)\nJoking Victim - EP (2010)\nRevolting Joks (2010)\nKilling Jokes - EP (2012)\nJ0T5 RMXD - EP (2012)\nJ0T5 - EP (2012)\nEndless Scene (2014)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nScion Sampler, Vol. 22: Fool's Gold Remixed (2008)\nFool’s Gold Vol. 1 (2010)\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\n\n== External links ==\nJokers-of-the-Scene at Fool's Gold Records\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/Jokers-of-the-Scene"

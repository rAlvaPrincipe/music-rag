    "text": "Corrin Campbell is a vocalist, bassist, songwriter, and entrepreneur. Corrin was an active-duty soldier in the United States Army, stationed with United States Army Recruiting Command at Fort Knox, KY from 2011 to 2017. Campbell was the only original music artist to be endorsed by a branch of the military. She is also a co-founder and the Director of Growth at Indepreneur.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHailing from Duluth, Minnesota, Corrin joined the United States Army and served as a bass guitar player and vocalist in the Army Band Field.\nIn addition to regular bandsman duties, she also participated in the 2003 U.S. Army Soldier Show: a 90-minute live musical review showcasing active duty soldiers. The show assembled in six weeks and then toured for 7 months in the continental United States, Cuba, and portions of Korea. Crowds would range from 100 to 13,000 people. During this time she was featured in promotional TV and radio interviews while on tour, and also performed behind Wynonna Judd at the 2003 Army Birthday Ball.\nFrom 2004 to 2005, she deployed with the 1st Cavalry Division to Baghdad in Operation Iraqi Freedom II. As a lead singer of the rock group, band leader of the jazz combo, and bass player of the Latin band, nearly every day contained a musical mission. Most days consisted of travel by Blackhawk to entertain soldiers across Iraq. She was featured at many high-profile shows, including the farewell parties of General Ricardo Sanchez and Ambassador Paul Bremer. She also met and opened for Robin Williams, Ted Nugent and Toby Keith when their USO tours came through Baghdad.\nCampbell served three years with the Maryland National Guard Band before returning to active duty in November 2009. She then served with the Army Materiel Command Band at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. It was while stationed here that Campbell was selected to play at Lilith Fair in Columbia, Maryland.\nCampbell relocated to the Nashville, Tennessee area when the Army Materiel Command Band moved to Redstone Arsenal, Alabama in November 2010 and was employed as the featured artist with the U.S. Army Musical Outreach Team until March 2017.\nOn January 7, 2017, Campbell announced to her fans, the Campbell Corps, that her band, Dash|Ten, is breaking up, and that she was leaving the Army.\n\"First, Dash|Ten has come to an end. I (Corrin) am leaving the Army in just a couple months. I've had an incredible career and so many amazing opportunities. It is what brought me to you! However, Steve and Pete are staying in the Army to continue on, and that means we have to part ways.\"\n-Campbell\nFor a short stint, Campbell opted to rename her project PRYM and released an EP and toured to several states in Summer 2017. Shortly after, however, she released a statement on her site explaining the short-lived band name and stated she would be returning to her solo name.\n\n\n== Solo Artist – Corrin Campbell (2018–present) ==\nCorrin re-released PRYM's EP \"At First Light\" under her solo name on February 15, 2018. on August 14, 2017. She also released a single, entitled \"Charlatan\", one year later on February 18, 2019 and its BAD ONE remix on December 13, 2019. In February 2020, Corrin announced her Greatest Hits Dual Disc would include one \"cinematic\" disc and one \"remix\" disc, to be in full on January 8, 2021, with digital singles starting in April 2020.\n\n\n== PRYM (2017–2018) ==\nPRYM released its first single, \"Lights\", in March 2017. This single was followed by the \"At First Light\" EP, released on August 14, 2017. The EP also includes \"What You Wanted\" and \"Our Time Now\", songs previously released with Dash|Ten. Band members were never disclosed.\n\n\n== Dash|Ten (2016–2017) ==\nThe band came together in early 2016, and their first public performance was the Warped Tour kick-off at Full Sail University in March 2016. All current members of the band are combat veterans of the U.S. Army, and the band is the only group officially backed by a branch of the military, touring and performing exclusively original music. The band's name comes from an Army term for a basic operating manual for equipment. \"We consider our musical sound as the basics of rock – just a power trio with no AutoTune, very little edits, not a lot of support tracks. We're rock at its basic level.\"\nDash|Ten was forced to drop off of the line-up of Warped Tour 2016 for uncited reasons. Corrin provided a quote to Rara's Farm, \"Unfortunately we had to leave the tour unexpectedly after the Darien Center, NY show. We're broken up about it, and hoping it's something that can be remedied. Kevin has been super supportive of us and let us know that we're welcome to come back if and when the Army works it all out.\"\n\n\n=== Band members ===\nSteve Ebert (Guitar)\nPete Greenberg (Drums)\nOn January 7, 2017, Campbell announced in her fan email list, Campbell Corps, that she is leaving the Army in 2017, and because Ebert and Greenberg are still in, they will be parting ways.\n\n\n== Corrin Campbell and The Election (2008–2015) ==\nCampbell transitioned from her solo artist name to Corrin Campbell & the Election in 2008, though all current releases are still listed under her solo name. Based in Baltimore, the band played mostly small local shows in the region until being selected to open Lilith Fair 2010 in Columbia, MD and dissolved into Campbell's Army position upon her selection for Army Musical Outreach.\n\n\n=== Band members ===\nTony Corbett (Drums, Mixing/Mastering)\nJim Boyer (Guitar)\n\n\n== Live Performances ==\nPRYM Summer Tour – June 29 – July 10\nWarped Tour 2016 – with Dash|Ten -First 18 dates through Darien Center, NY\nWarped Tour 2015 – All U.S. dates – June 19 – August 8, 2015\n2015 Santa Susana High School – Simi Valley, CA\nWarped Tour 2014 – June 17–29, July 18–29\n2014 & 2009 RedGorilla Fest – Austin, TX\nLos Angeles Lakers – NBA National Anthem – November 17, 2013\nGolden State Warriors – NBA National Anthem – November 10, 2013\nPittsburgh Steelers – Pre-game Fan Plaza and NFL National Anthem – November 10, 2013\n2013 & 2012 Drum Corps International World Championships – Lucas Oil Stadium – Indianapolis, IN\n2012 & 2011 Music City Bowl – LP Field – Nashville, TN\nSeattle Mariners – July 4, 2012\nWarped Tour 2012 – June 21–28, July 7, and July 20–25\nAtlanta Braves – Army Birthday, 2014 & Memorial Day, 2012\nLilith Fair 2010 – Merriweather Post Pavilion – Columbia, MD\n2010 Artscape – Baltimore, MD\n2010 & 2009 Launch Music Conference – Lancaster, PA\n2009 & 2008 Baltimore Music Conference – Baltimore, MD\nSinger-songwriter Cape May 2009 – Cape May, NJ\n2010 & 2009 Unicity Festival – Salisbury, MD\n2009 AtlantaFest – Atlanta, GA\n2008 M.E.A.N.Y.

Simply by merit of intentionally avoiding the \"Paramore sound,\" they have a head start on the vast majority of their contemporary female-fronted acts.\" – Randy Shatkowski of AntiHero Magazine.\n\"The ten track album is a full bodied music work of art that highlights their raw energy and passion for their music.\" – Marisol of Music Junkie Press.\n\"Finding an original sound in the female pop/rock world is a hard task, but it doesn't seem that way for Corrin Campbell. Her music displays many sides of her natural talent as Campbell shifts from harder electric guitar rock to the softer side of piano ballads. She has successfully found her footing and one step at a time, is sure to reach to top of the mountain of musical success.\" \n– Lisa Perron of Target audience Magazine\n\"'Exhibit A' is a CD with memorable tunes combined with appealing lyrics that you want to learn right away so you can sing along!\"\n– Alicia and the RadioIndy Review Team\n\"If her eight-song EP, Exhibit A, is any indication, we'll be hearing a lot more of Ms. Campbell in the coming years. Sweetly seductive vocals combine with girl-next-door good looks giver her an instant appeal for fans of the current crop of twenty-something female hitmakers. But it is her ability to turn of a phrase that lifts her above the crowd.\" \n-Mike Parker of buddyhollywood.com\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShe graduated from Full Sail University and lives in Nashville, Tennessee.\nCampbell has been connected to Paramore lead vocalist Hayley Williams. In 2003, they met through a shared vocal coach and William's Twitter account as also identified her as a friend.\nOn August 14, 2012 \"Thanks Corrin\" trended worldwide on Twitter when she attended and updated fans on the Paramore show at the Pomona Fox Theater in Pomona, California.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nCampbell has released different albums under her solo name, Corrin Campbell & the Election, Dash | Ten, and PRYM from 2007 to present.

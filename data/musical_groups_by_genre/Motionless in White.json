    "text": "Motionless in White is an American metalcore band from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Formed in 2004, the band consists of lead vocalist Chris \"Motionless\" Cerulli, guitarists Ryan Sitkowski and Ricky \"Horror\" Olson, drummer Vinny Mauro and bassist Justin Morrow. Cerulli is the only member of the original line-up that remains in the band. The group has stated that their band name derived from the Eighteen Visions song \"Motionless and White\".\nMotionless in White was signed to Fearless Records for their first three studio albums; their fourth album, Graveyard Shift, was released in May 2017 through Roadrunner Records. Their fifth album, Disguise, was released in June 2019, followed by their sixth album, Scoring the End of the World, in June 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early years (2004–2009) ===\n Motionless in White was founded in summer of 2004 by members Chris Motionless, who played guitar and lead vocals, Angelo Parente on drums, Frank Polumbo on guitar and Kyle White on bass during high school. For their first two shows at the Northeast Fair in Pittston, PA, the band was known as \"One Way Ticket\" and then as \"When Breathing Stops\" for the remainder of 2004. On New Year's Day of 2005, they settled on their current name. Chris Motionless and other members have noted bands such as Poison the Well, Slipknot, Marilyn Manson, Johnny Cash, Depeche Mode, and other musical groups as their inspiration. In 2005, they released their self-distributed demo.\nWithin the year after the release of their demo, new member Josh Balz was added as the band's keyboardist, Frank Polumbo took over on bass and new members, Michael Costanza and Thomas \"TJ\" Bell, were added to the band as the new guitarists, moving Chris Motionless solely to lead vocals. The band was discovered by Zach Neil while performing at a local nightclub called The Staircase. Neil signed the band first to management and then later to his record label Masquerade recordings. They recorded their first EP The Whorror which was produced by Zach Neil and mixed by Dan Malsch and released it through Masquerade Recordings/Warner music group in 2007.\n\nAfter touring in support of The Whorror, Motionless in White had written enough songs to complete a full-length album.  The album was named When Love Met Destruction. When Love Met Destruction was recorded in 2008 initially at Soundmine recording studio then finished at Zach Neil's home by Dave Cutrone and Zach Neil, and was released the same year on Masquerade Recordings. Neil added the band to his stage on the Warped tour with the new record in hand and the band quickly caught the attention of Shawn Milke from Alesana who offered to manage the band. Shortly thereafter Bob Becker of Fearless Records contacted Zach Neil to make an offer to buy the band's recording contract and sign the band to Fearless. The band and Neil agreed and Tragic Hero was offered to incubate the first official release to help grow the band leading up to their Fearless debut. The band was never actually signed to Tragic Hero Records.\nThe band parted ways with guitarist Michael Costanza and brought in current guitarist Ryan Sitkowski as his replacement. Despite being signed to Fearless before the months leading up to the release of the EP form of When Love Met Destruction, it was distributed through Tragic Hero on February 17, 2009. The song \"Ghost in the Mirror\" was made as the band's first ever single and had a music video produced for it.\n\n\n=== Creatures and line-up change (2009–2011) ===\n\nAfter the release of When Love Met Destruction, bassist Frank Polumbo departed Motionless in White due to unknown reasons, leaving Bellevue, Washington native, Ricky \"Horror\" Olson as their new permanent bass player in October 2009. Months later, Motionless in White entered the studio during May 2010 to record their debut full-length, Creatures with Andrew Wade as the chosen producer. The record's first single, \"Abigail\", premiered in Revolver Magazine on August 30 and was the released on iTunes the day after. A music video for the song was released a few months afterwards, along with following music videos over the next 2 years for title track \"Creatures\", the first track of the record \"Immaculate Misconception\" and a live music video for \"Puppets (The First Snow)\" which was filmed during the band's summer on The All Stars Tour in 2011.\nCreatures was released on October 12, 2010, through Fearless, and claimed the 175th slot on the Billboard Top 200 charts, and No. 6 on the Heatseekers chart.\nOn Wednesday May 4, 2011, guitarist Thomas Joseph \"TJ\" Bell was fired from the band. Reasons for the matter explained from Bell's perspective were that while he was handling bass substitution duties for Escape the Fate, he was expected to meet along with the rest of Motionless in White in Orlando, Florida by that tour's end. According to the band, Bell left in the middle of Motionless in White's tour schedule to fill-in as a bassist for Escape the Fate and also did not inform the rest of the members early enough in advance that he would not be available during those weeks. This action forced the band to be without their rhythm guitar parts during their performances. Motionless in White stated \"If our live performance didn't heavily depend on having 2 guitarists then it wouldn't have been a huge deal to us... but unfortunately having one guitar player in a band like ours causes your show to suffer greatly. We agreed to let TJ go,\" along with an explanation about how they experienced many disagreements with Bell throughout the years of being a band.\nAfter Bell's departure, Olson then switched his position in the band from playing bass to rhythm guitar, which then left the group in-audition, once again, for a new bass player. In the tours Motionless in White performed after Olson's switch to rhythm guitar, a man with an unknown name began playing bass, finally confirmed as being Devin Sola, who now goes by \"Ghost\", a substitute bassist. Sola was officially confirmed as the band's new bassist on November 27, 2011.\n\n\n=== Infamous (2012–2014) ===\n\nIn early 2012, Motionless in White contributed to the Kerrang! Metallica The Black Album: Covered on the song, \"My Friend of Misery.\"\nMotionless in White decided on working with two separate producers to accomplish a very wide array of sounds and styles for Infamous. It was then announced that Infamous was to be produced by Jason Suecof and musician Tim Sköld. On September 25 \"Devil's Night\" was released as the first single for the album. On October 9, their second single \"If It's Dead, We'll Kill It\" was released. On November 13, 2012, the music video for the single \"Devil's Night\" was released, along with the full album itself. Infamous initially hit No. 53 on the Billboard 200, No. 19 on Top Rock Albums, No. 9 on Top Independent Albums, and No. 5 on Top Hard Rock Albums.\nMotionless in White's ex-drummer, Angelo Parente, announced his departure from the band on March 11 via Tumblr, saying 'After doing this since I was 17, the nonstop touring, and everything else that comes with the life of a musician has finally caught up with me.'. He has left the band on good terms, and there is no sign of internal rifts. Brandon Richter formally of 'The Witch Was Right' was announced as the replacement drummer on April 23, 2013. This action left Chris Motionless as the band's last original member.\nOn April 23, the band released the third single from Infamous, \"America\", accompanied by a lyric video. On June 3, another video, directed by Slipknot percussionist Shawn Crahan, was released for the single. The video also starred Slipknot percussionist Chris Fehn.

There are a lot of points in the video that discuss what the album means to them with Chris Motionless saying, \"And with this record, I heavily gravitated towards writing about the long journey of admitting to myself that i'm struggling with a lot mentally while simultaneously being in the best and happiest place in my life, I was also in one of the darkest places and that contradiction of those feelings festered in my head and left me more and more confused by my life in general to which it then manifested into deeper and deeper destructive feelings and actions as my time ignoring it went on until one day I just lost it and broke down and there begins basically the story of so many of these songs.\" While the album has a lot of emotions in it, there are also different feelings for the album with Ryan Sitkowski saying that this is a \"solidified version of what Motionless in White actually is\". The recordings shown are the songs that can be heard across the album with the song, \"Another Life\" being a background track during parts of the video.

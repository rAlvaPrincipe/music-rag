    "text": "Abecedarians were an American, Los Angeles–based post-punk trio, active in the mid to late 1980s. The lineup consisted of Chris Manecke (guitar, vocals, keyboards), Kevin Dolan (drums) and John Blake (bass). They specialized in sparse, guitar-driven post-punk, though their most well-known song, \"Smiling Monarchs\", is alternative dance in the vein of New Order, and was in fact mixed by that band's guitar player and vocalist, Bernard Sumner.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1985: \"Smiling Monarchs\"/\"Benway's Carnival\" (single, Factory Records)\n1986: Eureka (mini-LP, Southwest Audio Reproductions)\n1987: Eureka (re-release, Caroline Records)\n1988: Resin (LP, Carlina Records)\n1988: AB-CD (CD, Carlina Records)\n1990: The Other Side Of The Fence (Independent Project Records) - recordings from 1983 to 1985\n2012: Eureka (re-release, Pylon)\nAn instrumental edit of \"Soil\" (from Eureka) was used in the 1987 film Billabong: Surf Into Summer. \"They Said Tomorrow\" (from The Other Side of the Fence) appeared on Trance Port Tapes' L.A.

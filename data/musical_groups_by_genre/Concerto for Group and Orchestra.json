    "text": "Concerto for Group and Orchestra is a live album by Deep Purple and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Arnold, recorded at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in September 1969. It consists of a concerto composed by Jon Lord, with lyrics written by Ian Gillan. This is the first full length album to feature Ian Gillan on vocals and Roger Glover on bass. It was released on vinyl in December 1969. The original performance included three additional Deep Purple songs, \"Hush\", \"Wring That Neck\", and \"Child in Time\"; these were included on a 2002 release. This was the last Deep Purple album distributed in the US by Tetragrammaton Records, which went defunct shortly after.\nThis album, a long planned project driven by Jon Lord, was not very successful in the United States but helped to restore Deep Purple's reputation and image in the United Kingdom. \nThe 1969 performance is considered \"groundbreaking\" because it was the first time that a major rock band recorded a live album with a full-fledged orchestra, cementing the \"then odd but today very common\" relationship between heavy rock and classical music. \nThe original score for the concerto was lost in 1970; however, it was performed again in 1999 with a recreated score, and has been performed several times since.\n\n\n== Original 1969 Royal Albert Hall performance ==\nThe piece was first performed and recorded on 24 September 1969 in the Royal Albert Hall, London, by Deep Purple and The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Malcolm Arnold. The programme consisted of:\n\n\n== Concerto ==\n\nConcerto for Group and Orchestra is split into three movements.\n\nFirst movement (Moderato – Allegro)\nAfter an extended orchestral introduction, the group and orchestra work as separate blocks, trying to get dominance over the main theme and working as antagonists to each other. There are cadenzas for electric guitar and clarinet.\nSecond movement (Andante), with lyrics sung by Ian Gillan\nThis movement is based around two tunes that are played in various different arrangements by the orchestra and the group, individually and together. After a combined pop / blues version of the second tune, there is an organ cadenza followed by a quiet ending by the orchestra.\nThird movement (Vivace – Presto)\nApart from Ian Paice's drum solo, the music combines the orchestra and group together in a \"free for all\". The movement alternates between 6/8 and 2/4 time signatures.\nThe Concerto was first performed at the Albert Hall in London on 24 September 1969 with Deep Purple and The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Arnold. It was performed at second time at the Hollywood Bowl on 25 August 1970, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Lawrence Foster, after which the score was lost.\n\n\n== Releases ==\nConcerto for Group and Orchestra was released on vinyl in December 1969 in the United States (Tetragrammaton) and in January 1970 in the United Kingdom (Harvest). These releases contained only the \"Concerto\", with the second movement broken in two-halves. Copies of the original US editions are rare as Tetragrammaton went bankrupt while the album was still being issued. In the following year, the Concerto became the only Tetragrammaton release to be reissued by Warner Bros., Deep Purple's new US label. On 4 April 1970 the Concerto was shown on British television as The Best of Both Worlds. \nThe 1990s saw a CD release including the songs \"Wring That Neck\" and \"Child in Time\". In 2002 EMI released special edition DVD-A, SACD and two-CD sets of Concerto for Group and Orchestra, featuring the entire programme of music played that night. In 2003 a video recording of this concert was released on DVD. However, four and a half minutes of the 1st Movement are missing in this video, as it was taken straight from the BBC's 4 April 1970 broadcast of the event (see above). The edit was in the original BBC broadcast.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== 1999 Royal Albert Hall performances ==\nOn 25 and 26 September 1999, thirty years after its initial performance, the Concerto was again performed in front of a live audience in the Royal Albert Hall. To make this performance possible, a new score was created by Lord with the assistance of Paul Mann and Marco de Goeij by listening to the recording and watching the video of the 1969 performance. Performers were:\n\nThe London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Paul Mann\nThe programme consisted of:\n\nFour Scottish Dances (Malcolm Arnold), performed by the London Symphony Orchestra\n\"Pictured Within\", performed by Jon Lord and Miller Anderson\n\"Wait A While\", performed by Jon Lord and Sam Brown\n\"Sitting in a Dream\", performed by Roger Glover and Ronnie James Dio\n\"Love Is All\", performed by Roger Glover and Ronnie James Dio\n\"Via Miami\", performed by Ian Gillan\n\"That's Why God Is Singing the Blues\", performed by Ian Gillan\n\"Night Meets Light\", performed by The Steve Morse Band\n\"Take It off the Top\", performed by The Steve Morse Band\n\"Wring That Neck\", performed by Ian Paice & The Kick Horns\nConcerto for Group and Orchestra (Jon Lord with lyrics by Ian Gillan), performed by Deep Purple and The London Symphony Orchestra\n\"First Movement: Moderato – Allegro\" (19:23)\n\"Second Movement: Andante\" (19:11)\n\"Third Movement: Vivace – Presto\" (13:09)\n\"Ted the Mechanic\", performed by Deep Purple and The London Symphony Orchestra\n\"Watching the Sky\", performed by Deep Purple and The London Symphony Orchestra\n\"Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming\", performed by Deep Purple and The London Symphony Orchestra\n\"Pictures Of Home\", performed by Deep Purple and The London Symphony Orchestra\n\"Smoke on the Water\", performed by the evening's entire ensemble\nA recording of the concert was released on a double CD as Live at the Royal Albert Hall. A cut recording of the performance was also released on DVD, entitled In Concert with the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n== 2000–2001 tour ==\nEncouraged by the success of the 1999 performances, Deep Purple took the Concerto on tour, first performing it in South America with local orchestras, then in Europe with the George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra, in Japan with the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra, all conducted by Paul Mann.\n\n\n== 40th anniversary performance ==\nOn 24 September 2009 Jon Lord joined the RTÉ Concerto Orchestra in the National Concert Hall, Dublin, Ireland to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first performance of Concerto for Group and Orchestra. Also performed, were pieces from Jon Lord's solo career and a number of Deep Purple songs including an orchestral version of Child In Time.\n\n\n== Further performances ==\nThe score of the concerto having been recreated, groups and orchestras across the world were free to perform it:\n\n\n== 2012 studio version ==\nIn October 2012 a studio version of the Concerto for Group and Orchestra was released. The recording features the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Paul Mann. The soloists are Jon Lord (organ), Darin Vasilev (guitar in the 1st movement), Joe Bonamassa (guitar in the 2nd movement), Steve Morse (guitar in the 3rd movement), Steve Balsamo, Kasia Łaska, and Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Brett Morgan (drums), and Guy Pratt (bass). The orchestral parts were recorded at the Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool on 1 and 2 June 2011. The band parts were recorded in August and October 2011 and also in May 2012. The album was mixed at Abbey Road Studios in late May 2012. According to Paul Mann, Jon Lord heard the final master of the recording a few days before his death on 16 July 2012.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Malcolm Arnold's views ===\nIn an interview for hospital radio in Huddersfield in 1970, shortly after the Royal Albert Hall performance, Arnold provided a positive take on the experience:\n\nWhat strikes me about Deep Purple is their tremendous musical integrity. This is so refreshing in a commercial world. I loved working with them. They're thorough musicians. They're not trying to prove anything. They just like to play now and again with a Symphony Orchestra. They're not trying to prove any deep philosophical problem. They just want to write music that's enjoyable.\n\n\n=== Ritchie Blackmore's views ===\nIn a 1979 interview with Sounds magazine Blackmore said:\n\nI was not into classical music then. I was very very moody and just wanted to play very very loudly and jump around a lot. I couldn't believe we were playing with orchestras. We kept getting lumbered playing with them.  We started off in '68 – this is my opinion – as a relatively competent band with a lot to say but saying it all at the same time as each other. In '69 we went into the classical stuff because it was Jon Lord's big thing to write a concerto for group and orchestra. He was very sincere, but I didn't like playing it or respect the fact that we were doing it. The orchestra was very condescending towards us, and I didn't like playing with them, so it was one big calamity onstage. But Jon was happy with it and management was happy with it because we had a press angle, which I resented very much.\nIn 1970 I said, 'right, we're going to make a rock and roll LP. If this doesn't succeed I'll play in orchestras for the rest of my life', because Jon wasn't too into hard rock. Luckily it took off, so I didn't have to play with orchestras any more.\n\nI love orchestras, chamber music – unaccompanied violin is my favourite. But I respected them too much, and we just weren't in the same calibre. I'd been playing 15 years at the time, and stuck next to some dedicated violinist who's been playing for 50 years just to give an angle to the press – it's insulting. That's why it started and ended very abruptly.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe cover art of the Swedish heavy metal band Opeth's 2010 concert DVD In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall is intentionally similar in layout, colour and motive to that of Deep Purple's Concerto for Group and Orchestra, \"underlining Opeth's longstanding love for their prog-rock roots\".\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nJon Lord – organ, orchestral arrangements\nRitchie Blackmore – guitar\nIan Gillan – vocals\nRoger Glover – bass\nIan Paice – drums\nRoyal Philharmonic Orchestra – orchestral instruments\nMalcolm Arnold – conductor\n\n\n== Charts ==\nOriginal album (1969)\n\nReunion performance (1999)\n\nJon Lord's studio version (2012)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n1969 performance (& recording)\n1999 performance (& recording)\n1999 performance (& recording)\nVincent Budd, The Gemini Man: an Introduction to the Orchestral Works of Jon Lord, 2003, Gnosis Press"

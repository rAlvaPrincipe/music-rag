    "text": "No Name (Montenegrin: Но нејм, romanized: No nejm) was a Montenegrin boyband, best known for the controversies surrounding their participation in the national pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. The group made its debut in 2005, with the song \"Zauvijek moja\" (Forever Mine) (Milan Perić/Slaven Knezović), winning the 2005 Europjesma and thus representing Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005. The group fared 7th in the ESC with a total of 137 points, succeeding in obtaining the straight pass to the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 for Serbia and Montenegro.\nIt was founded on 19 November 2003.\nIn November 2006, bassist Marko Perić left the group for an unknown reason.\nThe group disbanded in 2008.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMarko Perić - (2003–2006) (bass guitar)\nMarko Prentić (vocal, solo guitar)\nDanijel Alibabić (vocal)\nBranko Nedović (keyboards)\nDragoljub Purlija (drums)\nBojan Jovović (keyboards, back vocal).\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn 2005, as complete outsiders but with a song featuring a strong national (Montenegrin) identity, they received most of the votes from the jury appointed by RTCG, causing a stir among the Serbian and Montenegrin followers of the Eurovision Song Contest.\nIn March 2006, they participated in Montevizija 2006, the Montenegrin semi-final, and finished 2nd, going on to win the final Europjesma with \"Moja ljubavi\". The jury appointed by RTCG did not award any points to the Serbian-based group Flamingosi, who were declared winners by some even before the competition, while others favored No Name. The new arrangement of the song and No Name's victory came just in time for the campaign for Montenegrin independence, which started that year. Consequently, the Serbian TV station decided to pull out, preventing No Name from representing the country in Athens.\n\n\n== Singles ==\nZa Tebe i Mene (Sunčane Skale 2004 - 2nd place)\nBudućnost (FK Budućnost Podgorica supporters' song)\nZauvijek moja (Eurovision Song Contest 2005 - 7th place)\nMoja ljubavi (Evropesma 2006 - 1st place, withdrawn from Eurovision)\nForever Mine\nKad Budemo Zajedno (Music Festival Budva 2006)\nMoja Mala (duet with Macedonian singer Bojana)\nPostelja od Leda (Music Festival Budva 2007 - 2nd place)\nKad Kažeš Ne (Radijski Festival 2007)\nPronađi me\n\n\n== See also ==\nEuropjesma\nMontevizija\nSerbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest\nRadio Television of Montenegro\nEurovision Song Contest\n\n\n== External links ==\nSerbia and Montenegro in pop song row - BBC News article about events following the disputed Eurovision submission\nhttp://www.montenegrina.net/pages/pages1/muzika/upotreba_eurosonga_u_politicke_svrhe_z_milovic.htm"

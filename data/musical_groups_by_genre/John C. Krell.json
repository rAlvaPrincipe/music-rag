John was the model instrumentalist. He displayed sensitivity in his playing that revealed an understanding of the special schooling entrusted to us and that his integrity defended against whatever the odds. Kincaidiana is a testimony to this understanding and exists as both a unique tribute to his teachers (William Kincaid and Marcel Tabuteau) as well as a gift to succeeding generations as an invaluable method - John de Lancie (oboist), Former Solo Oboe, Philadelphia Orchestra, Former Director, Curtis Institute of Music\"\nKrell's publications include his 20th Century Orchestra Studies book published by G.

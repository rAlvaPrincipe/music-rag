    "text": "Duo Caron is a classical music group who transcribe and perform great orchestral works for various piano formations.\n\n\n== History ==\nBorn in Rimouski, Quebec, Canada, sibling pianists Josee and Martin Caron have lived in Montreal for several  years.   They started collaborating under the name Duo Caron in 1990.\nIn 1994, thanks to the unique nature of the transcriptions of masterful works and the quality of the high-level interpretations, the duo received an internship grant from the Quebec-Wallonia-Brussels Agency for Youth AQWBJ, for a promotional tour in French-speaking Belgium.\nFollowing this recognition, the duo obtained a series of concert engagements, recordings and federal grants such as Musicaction. These performances earned him rave reviews.\nSince 2020, the duo Caron has brought together pianists Carmen Picard and Josee Caron. The team's mandate remains the same, namely the interpretation of their own arrangements of orchestral works for two pianos and for piano duet.  Their thematic album (2023), described by The Music Scene as impeccable ensemble playing, brings together different styles of 20th century Suites.    \n\n\n== Premieres ==\nAlan Belkin's Petite Suite for two pianos, commissioned by the Duo Caron, was premiered by Duo Caron in Montreal's Claude-Champagne Concert Hall.\nIn 1998, the Quebec International Duo-Piano Festival commissioned to Martin Caron a George Gershwin transcription for two pianos eight hands, \"Strike up the Band\", premiered at the Gala Concert, pour terminer l'événement de façon spectaculaire, such as Mr. Arthur Kaptainis pointed out:\n\nDuo Caron's recordings include an album of post-Romantic works and another of works by Tchaikovsky,  about which Heléna Bowkun wrote :\n\nReleased in 2009, the recording British Music for Piano Four Hands  includes two new arrangements by Martin Caron of Paul McCartney's works. L’Avantage noted \"Précision remarquable\" about the interpretation of William Walton's Music for Children.   James Harrington from American Record Guide qualified this recording as a \"wonderful release\":\n\nAgain, in the March/April 2024 issue, Mr. Harrington mentions the high level of quality of Holst's transcriptions and interpretation for recording Modern Four-Hand Suites:\n\nTheir recordings are broadcast on CBC, SRC, \"Radio Classique\" CJPX, CKUA Radio Network Edmonton, and RTBF Radio \"Musiq’3\" Belgium.\n\n\n== Transcriptions by Josee Caron ==\n\n\n=== For Piano Duet ===\nGustav Holst (1874-1934): The Planets opus 32, Suite for large Orchestra\nI.

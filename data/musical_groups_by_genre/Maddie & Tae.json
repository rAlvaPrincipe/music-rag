    "text": "Maddie & Tae are an American female country music duo composed of Maddie Font (née Marlow) and Tae Kerr (née Dye), both of whom are singers, songwriters, and guitarists. The duo was signed to the revived Dot Records in 2014. Their debut album, Start Here, was released on August 28, 2015, and includes the singles \"Girl in a Country Song\", \"Fly\", \"Shut Up and Fish\", and \"Sierra\". Following the closure of Dot, they signed to Mercury Nashville in 2018. They released their second studio album The Way It Feels for this label in April 2020, and the first part of their third studio album, Through The Madness in 2022.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2010–2016: Early beginnings and Start Here ===\nIn 2010, Maddie Marlow and Tae Dye were both going to the same vocal coach and met at a showcase in Dallas. Within the year, the duo were going back and forth to Nashville every weekend while still going to school. They first performed under the name Sweet Aliana.

Maddie & Tae were confirmed as the first signees of the label in June 2014.\nThey wrote their debut single, \"Girl in a Country Song\", with Aaron Scherz, who co-produced it with Dann Huff. The song is a criticism of the then-contemporary bro-country trend. \"Girl in a Country Song\" debuted at number 58 on the Country Airplay chart dated for the week ending July 19, 2014. After 23 weeks, it reached number 1 for the chart dated December 20, 2014, becoming the first debut single by a female duo to reach number one since The Wreckers did it in 2006 with \"Leave the Pieces\", and only the second in history.

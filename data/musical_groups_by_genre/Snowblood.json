    "text": "Snowblood were a four-piece (sometimes five-piece) experimental sludge/post rock/doom metal band from Glasgow, Scotland, formed in 2002. Their third and final self-titled album was released in 2009, through Superfi Records.\nSnowblood composed lengthy guitar-based pieces, usually focused around the elaboration of a single theme. These pieces developed the dynamics between the serene and the brutal side of the post rock and doom metal genres. \nTheir first two albums, The Human Tragedy (2004) and Being and Becoming (2005) were both recorded by Neil McNaught at the Split Level Studios in Edinburgh, Scotland. Their third album was recorded and produced by the band in a cottage near the Scottish village of Buckie.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Human Tragedy [Superfi (LP) / Lawgiver (CD)] 2004\nBeing and Becoming [Superfi (LP) / Lawgiver (CD)] 2005\nSelf Titled [Superfi (CD)] 2009\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\"Aubade\" appeared on It Came From the Hills (Magic Bullet Records)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSuperfi Records Official Website\nSnowblood discography at Discogs"

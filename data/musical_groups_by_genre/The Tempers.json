    "text": "The Tempers are an American electronic art rock band based in Seattle, WA. The group consists of siblings Corina (vocals), Chalia (drums), and James (synth) Bakker. They play \"electronic music that blends the more psychedelic sounds of the early 70's with an experimental electronic sound inspired by artists of the last two decades...Dead Disco, Love wave, Tropical Black Magicâ€“it has yet to be defined by a genre.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Tempers formed in the summer of 2006, when they wrote and put their first song on Myspace, \"Scissors.\"  The Tempers continued to release songs, such as \"White Walls\" and \"Fix\" via Myspace.  \"Scissors\" and \"White Walls\" were never released on an album and are no longer available commercially. \"Fix\" was later rerecorded and released on \"Vol. 1 (The Tempers album)\".\nThe Tempers started playing shows in 2009, their first show being at the High Dive in Seattle, WA.  On October 31, 2010, they self-released their debut studio album, Vol. 1.  They also released a self-directed music video for the track \"Alone Again\".\nFor The Tempers second release, they enlisted the help of Kickstarter, a crowdfunding platform. They raised enough money for the production of an EP, \"Together We Are The Love Vortex,\"  that they self-released on July 6, 2012.  Another self-directed music video for the track \"You Must Be Crazy\" was released as well.\nThe Tempers are currently working on new material with Producer Gordon Raphael (The Strokes, Regina Spektor).\nIn 2021, they released a new EP entitled \"Vol. 2\" \n\n\n== Influences ==\nOn \"The Tempers picks\", a part of the weeklong series SSG Music did on The Tempers, they selected  songs they liked by The Knife, Fever Ray, Roxy Music, Funkadelic, Cee-Lo, Peter Gabriel, and Kate Bush.  In another interview done by City Arts Magazine where Corina was asked \"What kind of music did you listen to growing up? What about now?\", she responded \"Marvin Pontiac.

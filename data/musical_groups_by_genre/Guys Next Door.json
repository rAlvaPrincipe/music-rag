    "text": "Guys Next Door is an American sketch comedy television series aired on NBC in the 1990–91 season as part of its Saturday morning lineup. It featured a boy band performing comedy sketches and spoofs, as a combination of New Kids on the Block with The Monkees. The show starred Patrick J. Dancy, Eddie Garcia, Bobby Leslie, Damon Sharpe, and Chris Wolf.  Several music videos were created for the individual episodes; they were produced by Joseph Sassone and directed by Dominic Orlando.\nAs a band, the group was signed to SBK Records and released a self-titled album, which spawned a single titled \"I've Been Waiting for You\". The single peaked at #42 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on February 23, 1991.\nWhile Wolf and Leslie dropped out of the public eye after the show ended, Dancy and Garcia are still active as actors.  Sharpe is currently a music producer and songwriter who has worked with such artists as Jennifer Lopez, Kylie Minogue, Anastacia, Kelly Rowland, Big Time Rush, New Boyz, and Monica.\nThe series sparked criticism by parents, teachers, and media experts due to airing a targeted program for young adult audiences on Saturday mornings that was since attended to be a marathon for children, causing the series to be cancelled after one season. Prior to its cancellation in 1991, then-President George H. W. Bush signed a deal to require educational content on NBC by the Children's Television Act, which became a downfall for the network and completely eliminating children’s programming in Summer 1992.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGuys Next Door at IMDb"

    "text": "Baracuda was a German dance project founded by Axel Konrad and Ole Wierk of Suprime Records in the Winter of 2002. Baracuda consists of Tobias Lammer, otherwise known as DJ Toby Sky and vocalist Suny.\n\n\n== History ==\nTheir debut, most popular and well-known track is \"Damn! (Remember the Time)\", a cover of the Matthias Reim song \"Verdammt, Ich Lieb' Dich\". This track managed to secure Baracuda the 12th spot in the German Single Chart. Baracuda's second track, \"I Leave The World Today\", became fairly popular in the Summer of 2003.\nTwo years later in July 2005 Baracuda released their third single, \"Ass Up\". This song managed to grab the 70th spot in the German Singles Charts.\nBaracuda released a fourth single \"La Di Da\" in May 2007.\nIn August 2008 the group released their fifth single, \"I Will Love Again\", a cover of Lara Fabian's famous hit from the year 2000. This single's success was more of that of their previous tracks, grabbing the 34th position in the German Singles Chart. The song makes use of the melody evident in Groove Coverage's track \"God is a Girl\".\nThe latest Baracuda song \"Where is the Love\" is the sixth single, and a knockoff version of Nightwish's song \"Amaranth\" and Alice Cooper's song \"Poison\".\nThe group did not make plans for a full album. They parted ways with EMI Music a couple of years later and have not performed together since. According to the production company, no further singles are currently planned.\n\n\n== Line-Up ==\nAxel Konrad (Producer)\nOle Wierk (Producer)\nDJ Toby Sky (Discjockey)\nSuny (Vocal-Live-Act)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nGroove Coverage - a related group by Axel Konrad\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBaracuda on Last.fm\nBarcuda on Discogs.com\nOfficial Page - Baracuda's Official Homepage"

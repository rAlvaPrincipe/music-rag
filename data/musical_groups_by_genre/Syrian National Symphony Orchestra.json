    "text": "The Syrian National Symphony Orchestra (Arabic: الفرقة السيمفونية الوطنية السورية, al-firqah as-sīmfūniyyah al-waṭaniyyah as-sūriyyah) is the national symphony orchestra of Syria. Its home venue is the Damascus Opera House, and many of its members have been educated at the Higher Institute for Music in the same cultural complex on Umayyad Square in a central location of Damascus.\n\n\n== History and musical activities ==\nThe orchestra was founded by Iraqi-born composer and musician Solhi al-Wadi, its first conductor as well as the director of the Higher Institute for Music in Damascus, and gave its first public concert in 1993. On 4 September 1998, the orchestra performed in the United States, at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. The orchestra has its permanent home in the Damascus Opera House, and its principal conductor is the Syrian-Armenian maestro Missak Baghboudarian, who received his academic training in Italy.\nThe orchestra's repertoire includes both Western classical music, as well as works by contemporary Syrian composers, including Maias Alyamani, Malek Jandali, or Zaid Jabri. - A charity concert by the orchestra on 3 February 2009 raised $110,000 for an UNRWA campaign for the children of Gaza.\nApart from the symphony orchestra, there is also a Syrian National Orchestra for Arabic Music performing classical Arabic music, with musicians like Syrian oud virtuoso Issam Rafea, trained in this musical tradition of the Middle East.\nDue to the ongoing civil war in Syria, many musicians have left the country for exile in Europe, the US or other countries, but still, the musical audience in Damascus, as well as the authorities and remaining musicians, continue with concerts and other musical activities. In July 2020, the SNSO participated with an online performance from Damascus of Beethoven's Eroica symphony in a series of friendship concerts, where Italian conductor Riccardo Muti conducted his Luigi Cherubini Youth Orchestra with Syrian guest musicians in Ravenna, Italy. In January 2024, Baghboudarian spoke about the ways the SNSO has adapted to the difficult social situation. Citing the continued great interest of the audience for classical music in Damascus, he mentioned selecting music with a dramatic expression, such as Beethoven's fifth and third symphonies or Mahler's Songs on the Death of Children. Reaching out to young audiences, he talked about a project under the title \"Discover Music\", directed towards children living in shelters, organized in cooperation with the Syria Trust for Development. In this project the SNSO invited children to attend the orchestra's training sessions, in order to experience live classical music and to learn about musical instruments. During one cold winter, the orchestra only asked visitors to bring along warm clothes for needy children, instead of buying a ticket.\n\n\n== References =="

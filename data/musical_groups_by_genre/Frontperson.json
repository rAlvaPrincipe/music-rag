They released their first album, Frontrunner, in 2018. The album, recorded at the National Music Centre in Calgary, Alberta, was supported by the single \"Tick Tock (Frontrunner)\", whose video was collated from clips of athletes played in reverse.\nTheir second album, Parade, was released in April 2022. The album's release was preceded by the release of two preview singles, the title track in February and \"Ostalgie (FÃ¼r C. Bischoff)\" in March.\n\n\n== References =="

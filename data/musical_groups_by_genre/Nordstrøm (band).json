    "text": "Nordstrøm is a Danish electronic-pop duo formed in 2004 in Copenhagen. The group consists of Troels Holdt and Lars Malm, who had been friends for more than 10 years before starting the group.\nThe group's name is a compound word of the Danish words nord and strøm, meaning north-energy. According to Holdt and Malm, the name was chosen with the idea that electronic music comes from the northern sky, and that electricity creates life.\n\n\n== History ==\nThough Nordstrøm produces electronic pop, Malm and Holdt's friendship and collaboration were sparked by the Hank Williams classic \"There's A Tear In My Beer\". Both artists share a love for country classics, though the genre's influence on their music is not obvious. Malm and Holdt say that they draw inspiration for their songs from everyday life.\nBefore forming Nordstrøm, Malm and Holdt played in a number of smaller bands. Though they managed to tour the Balkans, they eventually dropped their other projects in favor of Nordstrøm.\nNordstrøm debuted in 2006 with their single \"Berlin,\" which was released by EMI. \"Berlin\" was chosen as P3's inevitable song of the week and was the radio station's most played song in 2006. The song received a gold certificate in August 2006, and, by April 2008, had sold approx. 12,000 copies. The single was a precursor to the album Dagdrømmer, which was released in August 2006. The album also received a gold certificate after selling 15,000 copies.\nNordstrøm has played concerts at a variety of Danish music festivals, including: the Spot Festival in Aarhus, Vega, Roskilde Festival, and the Plænen festival at Tivoli.\nIn 2009, the duo collaborated with Lise Cabble to write and produce the song \"Big Bang Baby\", which was performed by Claus Christensen at the 2009 Dansk Melodi Grand Prix. Performing under the name Fenger//Nordstrøm, the duo collaborated with Søs Fenger to produce the album \"Gnister\" in 2015.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Dagdrømmer (2006) ===\nStereo\nBerlin\nDu Og Jeg\nFoden Indenfor\nSpil For Galleriet\nInkonsekvent\nGi’ Besked\nVelsignede Tøs\nNatteravn\nDagdrømmer\nSmil Du’ På\nRotation\n\n\n=== Endnu En (2008) ===\nPerfekt\nEndnu En\nHvem Hvad Hvor\nLyden Af Dit Smil\nHun Sidder Her\nBonnie & Clyde\nOK\nBusiness Class\nLagt På Is\nFor Himlens Skyld\nMig Og Min Vagt\nRo På\n\n\n=== Alt På Plads (2010) ===\nRespirator\nJanuar\nAlt På Plads\nEn Sommer Der Bli'r\nEn Sommer Der Bli'r, Pt. 2\nSang Som Ingen Hører\nNy Start\nLykkeligt Glemt\nJohnny\nSamlebånd\nKapitulation\nTanken Tom\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nBerlin (May 2006)\nGi besked (August 2006)\nSensommersol (September 2006, non album track)\nDu og jeg (December 2006)\nSpil for galleriet (March 2007)\nEndnu En (March 2008)\nLyden af dit smil (June 2008)\nDanmark, det er jul (December 2008)\nPerfekt (January 2009)\nJanuar (January 2010)\nJohnny (Maj 2010)\nRespirator (October 2010)\nSort Mercedes (April 2011)\n\n\n== References =="

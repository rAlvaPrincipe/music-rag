    "text": "The Pillbugs were an American power pop and psychedelic pop group that emerged on the indie music scene in the late 1990s.\nBased in Toledo, Ohio, the band consisted of Mark Mikel (vocals/guitar/keyboards), David Murnen (vocals/percussion), Mark Kelley (vocals/bass), Scott Tabner (guitar), Dan Chalmers (drums/vocals). They released 5 albums and initially billed themselves as \"the world's most psychedelic band.\" Of this statement Mikel said, \"I don't know if we are or not. We thought so when we first formed. It was just something to draw attention. It probably isn't completely true.\"\nThe Pillbugs disbanded in 2008 following Mark Kelley's death from an endocrine disorder.\n\n\n== History ==\n1991 - 1998: Mark Mikel formed a band with David Murnen, Mark Kelley, Dan Chalmers and Scott Tabner named after himself. They performed numerous times and released two original albums named Sorghum Pudding in 1991, The Idiot Smiles in 1994, and one cover album named Blatant Ripoffs in 1996. After building fame in their area, they decided to change their name to make them more Beatles-esque, which because The Beatles were one of their greatest influences, makes \"The Pillbugs\" a fitting name. After they changed their name in early 1998, they began work on their first album under the name.\nJune 1998: The first Pillbugs CD is released on their own label (Omniphonic). This was a 32-song double-disc set. All songs were produced by Mark Mikel.\nJuly 1999: Bass player/vocalist Mark Kelley is diagnosed with a rare lung cancer.\nMarch 2003: The Pillbugs release their second album, The 3-Dimensional In-Popcycle Dream.

Despite being in this condition, he manages to supply the bass guitar for the next Pillbug album.\nApril 2007: The Pillbugs catch the attention of power pop label Rainbow Quartz who signed the band a deal for a \"best-of\" CD release. Later, this album was named Monclovia, after a township nearby Toledo.\nJune 2007: The Pillbugs release their fourth album (and second double CD) Buzz for Aldrin on the Proverus label. The songs' melodies, lyrics and themes are intertwined, ultimately leading back to their first album. The artwork was created by renowned California artist Mark Roland specifically for this release.

A video for the song \"Spaced-Out\" was also made.\nJuly 2007: Proverus officially announces the third CD Happy Birthday is out of print.\nAugust 2007: USA Today music editor Ken Barnes chooses The Pillbugs \"All in Good Time\" in his \"Pick of the Week\" column.\nSeptember 2007: USA Today music editor Ken Barnes chooses The Pillbugs \"4 sec Nightmare in a 5 sec Dream\" in his \"Pick of the Week\" column.\nOctober 2007: The Rainbow Quartz CD Monclovia released in USA and Canada.

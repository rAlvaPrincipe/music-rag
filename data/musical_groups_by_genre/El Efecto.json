    "text": "El Efecto is a Brazilian rock band, formed in 2002 by Tomás Rosati, Bruno Danton and Eduardo Baker. All their studio works are available for free download at their official website. Their lyrics often deal with political and social subjects.\nIn 2013, their third album Pedras e Sonhos (Rocks and Dreams) made the group be nominated for the Prêmio da Música Brasileira Award, in the category Best Pop/Rock/Reggae/Hip hop/Funk Group.\nIn December 2014, they released their fourth album, A Cantiga É uma Arma, (Cantiga \nIs a Weapon) which features four acoustic re-recordings and two new songs, also acoustic. That album is a studio version of a show format they decided to use to make it possible for them to perform in places with poor infrastructure for electric music. Both the new songs were composed in 2013, when the band toured Portugal and Spain. One of the re-recordings, \"Ciranda\", received a video with a guest appearance of singer Daíra Saboia.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAline Gonçalves – flute, clarinet\nBruno Danton – vocals, guitar, trumpet\nCristine Ariel – guitar, cavaquinho, vocals\nEduardo Baker / Pedro Lima – bass\nGustavo Loureiro – drums\nTomás Rosati – vocals, cavaquinho, percussion, clarinet\nTomás Tróia – guitar, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nComo Qualquer Outra Coisa (2004)\nCidade das Almas Adormecidas (2008)\nPedras e Sonhos (2012)\nA Cantiga É uma Arma (2014)\nMemórias do Fogo (2018)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nNovas Músicas Velhas Angústias (2010)\n\n\n=== Live ===\nAo Vivo no Méier (2018)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

They released their self-titled debut album in 2002, followed by the Carnival records release Level in 2005. Their third album, Jet Black & Jealous, was released in 2008 by Universal South Records.

They played guitar and eventually began writing and singing songs together; they formed the acoustic duo, Eli & Young, while attending the University of North Texas and played locally at Rockin Rodeo before they got their big start. Chris Thompson and Jon Jones joined them later on and they became the Eli Young Band.\nThey released Level on Carnival Records on April 5, 2005, and opened shows for Miranda Lambert. Level is their last Texas country album before becoming a Nashville act. Many of these songs can still be heard in their live shows today, such as \"Small Town Kid\" and \"Everything Is You\".\n\n\n=== Jet Black & Jealous ===\nWhile touring, they were also making songwriting a top priority and made time for writing trips and retreats at the Young family ranch.  Energized with new songs, they were ready to begin working on a new album in late 2007. Working with producers Frank Liddell and Mike Wrucke (who have also produced for Lambert), they took time off from touring to record at Omni Studios in Nashville. Their third album, Jet Black & Jealous, was released in 2008. Its lead-off single, \"When It Rains\", spent 37 weeks on the country charts and peaked at No. 34.

Their debut album \"Let Me In\" sold over 50,000 copies, earning the CD platinum status in South Africa.  All four members of the band were born and raised in Temba, \"Pretoria\", and grew up in the church.\nThe band formed in 1995 and was later discovered by Carl Eaton (manager of South African stars Mandoza and Ernie Smith, Pitch Black Afro). In 2000 the band released their debut EP, Khalil, featuring the smash hit “Mama Said,” which quickly made it to Chart Breaker of the Week and #25 on YFM’s Top 100 singles for the year. The EP also spawned the hit single “Feel the Vibe” (featuring Loyiso), which was on Metro FM’s Local Top 20 for more than 12 weeks. The following year the group was nominated for two Metro FM awards for Best Duo/Group and Best R&B, and were featured in Cosmopolitan and Drum magazines, among others.\nIn 2005 Khalil signed to the David Gresham Record Company, a large indie label in South Africa.

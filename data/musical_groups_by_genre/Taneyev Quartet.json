    "text": "The Taneyev Quartet made its first appearance in the Small Hall of the Leningrad Conservatory in the winter of 1946. Its members were students. The quartet played in particular the quartets of Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, and Taneiev but also included first performances of works by the Leningrad composers V. Salmanov, O. Evlakhov, V. Basner, A. Chernov, V. Agafonnikov and others. 1974 Dmitry Shostakovich asked the Taneyev Quartet to take over the responsibility of the world premiere of his 15th string quartet, an offer which they accepted.\nThe name of Taneyev was adopted by the Quartet in 1963. Its members are: Vladmir Ovcharek, Grigori Lutski, Vissarion Soloview and Josif Levinson.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLiner note with S.

    "text": "The Qemists are an English electronic rock group, hailing from Brighton, Sussex. They are signed to Amazing Record Co., an indie record label based in the UK. The band have a separate deal with Beat Records for distribution in Japan and with Detroit-based label FiXT Music for North America.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Qemists were originally the drummer, bassist and guitarist in a rock band where they spent a lot of time touring UK and Europe as well as spending a lot of time in the studio. During this time in the rock band in the late 1990s, they acquired an interest in drum and bass and some of the group's early efforts started to get airplay. For many years they were performing in the rock band as their day job while producing and DJing drum and bass at night, and this conflict of interests led to the fusion of the two styles to form The Qemists sound that is known today.\nThey had previously worked as live sound engineers for Basement Jaxx, Kano and Lady Sovereign.\nTheir debut release on Ninja Tune was a remix of Coldcut's \"Everything Is Under Control\" which was supported by Zane Lowe, Coldcut and Pendulum.\nTheir first single, \"Stompbox\", appeared on the soundtrack for the film Jumper.  \"Dem Na Like Me\" and \"Your Revolution\" were used in Clay Porter's mountain bike movie 3 Minute Gaps (2011). \"Stompbox\" and \"Tom Cat\" appeared in the action movie Blitz (2011).\nIn 2009, they supported Enter Shikari on their World tour, and underwent their own headlining UK tour.\n\nIn November 2015, they signed to Amazing Record Co., planning the release of Warrior Sound, their third studio album, on 4 March 2016.\n\n\n== Members ==\nBruno Balanta – vocals (MC)\nOliver Simmons – vocals\nLiam Black – guitar\nDan Arnold – bass, synth programming\nLeon Harris – drums\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nMatt Rose – vocals\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nWith the band's origins in heavy rock music and their fusion of electronic rock and drum and bass, The Qemists are often compared to bands such as Pendulum and The Prodigy.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nJoin the Q (2009)\nSpirit in the System (2010)\nWarrior Sound (2016)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nSoundsystem (2011)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"React\" (2004)\n\"Summer Son\" (2004)\n\"Iron Shirt\" / \"Let There Be Light\" (2006)\n\"Stompbox\" (2007)\n\"Dem Na Like Me\" (feat.

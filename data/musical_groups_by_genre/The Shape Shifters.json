    "text": "The Shape Shifters are an underground hip hop collective based in Los Angeles, California. It consists of Akuma, Awol One, Circus, Die Young, Existereo, LA Jae, Life Rexall, Perk One, and Radioinactive.\nThe group prevented the Shapeshifters, another act from the United Kingdom, from using the name in the United States. That resulted in the latter changing its name to Shape:UK, but for the United States only.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nPlanet of the Shapes (1998)\nKnow Future (1999)\nAdopted by Aliens (2000)\nSoul-Lows (2002)\nSoulows Two (2004)\nThe Shape Shifters Was Here (2004)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Triple Threat\" (1998)\n\"2012\" (1999)\n\"Circuit City\" (2004)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShape Shifters on Myspace"

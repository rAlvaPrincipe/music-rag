In 2007, the duo signed a deal with American recording artist T.I.'s Grand Hustle Records. In 2007, Nard & B founded TrenchWerk Entertainment, a music production company, with the intention of \"uniting the best music producers in Atlanta and creating the most undeniable and unmatched production available.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nBrandon Rackley, professionally known as B, met James Bernard Rosser Jr., professionally known as Nard, while they were both attending at Omnithech, majoring in Music and Engineering. Upon completing college, Nard landed a job as a tracking engineer for Atlanta-based rapper T.I.'s label, Grand Hustle Records. In 2007, Nard & B received their first placement on a major label studio album. The song, titled \"That's Right\", features vocals from T.I. and was included on Grand Hustle artist Big Kuntry King's debut effort, My Turn to Eat. The success of the record earned them the attention of Grand Hustle president Jason Geter, who signed them as in-house producers. Also in 2007, Nard & B officially remixed T.I.'s hit single \"Big Shit Poppin' (Do It)\", providing new production while Grand Hustle rappers Mac Boney, Alfamega, JR Get Money and Big Kuntry King, all added new verses. In 2009, Nard & B co-produced Brooklyn-based rapper Maino's hit single \"All the Above\", alongside high-profile record producer Just Blaze. Nard & B also went on to contribute production on Puff Daddy's 2015 project MMM (Money Making Mitch).

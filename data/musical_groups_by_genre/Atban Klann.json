    "text": "A.T.B.A.N Klann (A Tribe Beyond a Nation) was an American hip hop group composed of Will 1X, apl.de.ap, Mooky Mook, and DJ Motiv8. The Atban Klann were signed to Eazy-E's Ruthless Records. Will 1X (who later changed his stage name to will.i.am) and apl.de.ap were first signed by Eazy-E when they were in high school and would later become members of The Black Eyed Peas.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was signed to Ruthless Records in 1992 and debuted on Eazy-E's EP, 5150: Home 4 tha Sick on the track entitled \"Merry Muthaphuckkin' Xmas\".  Soon after, the group recorded their debut album, Grass Roots, which was to be released on October 6, 1994; however, the album was shelved shortly before its release, and shortly after being jailed for 6 weeks in early 1995 on a domestic assault charge, Mookie Mook would leave after an argument. The duo would stay with Ruthless until they were dropped from the label after Eazy-E died in 1995. Will 1X would change his name to will.i.am and the Atban Klann would add Taboo and later Fergie and become the Grammy award winning band, The Black Eyed Peas.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1994: Puddles of H2O\n\n\n== Studio album ==\n\nGrass Roots was originally planned for release at the end of 1993 for Ruthless Records, distributed by Relativity Records; however, the album was put on hold. In 1994, the group released the first single from the album, \"Puddles of H2O\", as a CD single and promotional twelve-inch, with the B-side single \"Let Me Get Down\". However, with the band being dropped from Ruthless in 1995 it was not released at that time. The songs from the album later leaked and a cover was made using a photo of apl.de.ap and will.i.am from the Bridging the Gap photo-shoot in 2000. It was then remastered and released properly for the first time on vinyl in 2020 by Back 2 Da Source Records, which sold out.\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\n\"Open Your Mind\"\n\"Put On Your Adidas\"\n\"Goin for a Ride\"\n\"Mountain Top\" (feat.

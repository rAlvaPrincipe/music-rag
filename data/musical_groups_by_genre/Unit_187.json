    "text": "Unit:187 is a Canadian industrial band, started by John Morgan and Tod Law in 1994.\n\n\n== History ==\nUnit:187 (also known as Unit 187) was formed in Vancouver, British Columbia. Vancouver industrial scene influences such as Front Line Assembly and Skinny Puppy helped guide the band to write their first self-titled studio album which was released by 21st Circuitry in 1995. In 1998, the band's second album Loaded, produced by Devin Townsend gained critical acclaim with several of the songs becoming international favorites on the industrial music charts. In 1999, 21st Circuitry Records collapsed, and left the band to find a new home for their music.v In 2001, 187 released Capital Punishment on their new label, COP International. Mixes by Ken 'Hiwatt' Marshall and Anthony Valcic made the album stand out as the band's best to date and cemented their unique deep electronic sound as something apart from the ordinary, according to critics.\nUnit:187 released their fourth studio album, Out for Blood, at the end of October 2010 with producer Chris Peterson.\nIn 2012, Unit:187 and Vendetta Music released the \"Out for Blood\" Remix album Transfusion featuring remixes from bands including Stiff Valentine, 16Volt, Mindless Faith and iVardensphere.\nOn June 22, 2015, Unit:187 announced on its Facebook page that Tod Law had died as a result of leukemia.\nUnit:187's fifth studio album 'Killcure' will released on Dec 6th, 2024 by Metropolis Records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nUnit:187 (1996)\nLoaded (1997)\nCapital Punishment (2001)\nOut for Blood (2010)\nRemix albums\n\nTransfusion (2012)\nEPs\n\nStillborn (1997)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nUnit:187 at AllMusic\nUnit:187 on Facebook\nUnit:187 discography at Discogs \nUnit:187 discography at MusicBrainz"

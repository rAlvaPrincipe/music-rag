They have released four top-20 studio albums and have been nominated for two ARIA Awards.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2011–2013: Formation and The Pacific EP ===\n\nAustralian-born songwriters Timothy Carroll and Oscar Dawson initially met as volunteer English teachers in Southeast Asia.

They signed to Sydney label, Wonderlick Entertainment in December 2013, and released The Pacific EP in March 2014. Meanwhile, Carroll enlisted drummer Ryan Strathie (ex-Hungry Kids of Hungary) and bass guitarist Graham Ritchie (ex-Emma Louise, Airling), to join the band. Producer Matt Redlich (of Ball Park Music, Emma Louise, the Trouble with Templeton), joined them as a guest touring musician on keyboards and backing vocals.

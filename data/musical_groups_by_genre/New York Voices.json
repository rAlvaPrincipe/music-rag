    "text": "New York Voices is a jazz vocal group that was founded in 1987 by Peter Eldridge, Caprice Fox, Sara Krieger, Darmon Meader, and Kim Nazarian. All except Krieger were members of an alumni group from Ithaca College that toured Europe in 1986. They began performing as the New York Voices in 1988 and issued their debut album the following year. Sara Krieger left in 1992 and was replaced by Lauren Kinhan. After Caprice Fox left, the group became a quartet.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nNew York Voices (GRP, 1989)\nHearts of Fire (GRP, 1991)\nWhat's Inside (GRP, 1993)\nNew York Voices Sing the Songs of Paul Simon (RCA Victor, 1998)\nSing!

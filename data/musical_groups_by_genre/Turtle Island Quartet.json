    "text": "The Turtle Island Quartet is a string quartet that plays hybrids of jazz, classical, and rock music. The group was formed in 1985 by David Balakrishnan, Darol Anger, and Mark Summer in San Francisco. They released their first album on Windham Hill Records in 1988 with Irene Sazer.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group plays jazz standards and original compositions that cross several styles, including blues, classical, jazz, and world music. Violinist David Balakrishnan got the idea for a jazz string quartet in 1985. He invited cellist Mark Summer, who had been working for three years as a member of a Canadian orchestra. One of the first pieces they played was Balakrishnan's arrangement of \"Stolen Moments\" by Oliver Nelson which was released on their first album in 1987. The group's members have included violinist Evan Price and Danish violist Mads Tolling. Price and Tolling are both alumni of Berklee College of Music.\nAs a child, Balakrishnan was inspired by Jimi Hendrix. Then he discovered jazz and the music of the David Grisman Quartet.\nBalakrishnan's arrangement of \"A Night in Tunisia\" by Dizzy Gillespie was nominated for a Grammy Award. The group won a Grammy Award for its version of A Love Supreme by John Coltrane.\nThe quartet has worked with Paquito D'Rivera, Ying Quartet, Edgar Meyer, the Manhattan Transfer, Modern Jazz Quartet, and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent\n\nDavid Balakrishnan – violin and baritone violin (original member) (1985–1993, 1997–present)\nBenjamin von Gutzeit – viola (2012–present)\nNaseem Alatrash – cello (2021–present)\nGabriel Terracciano – violin (2018–present)\nPast\n\nMark Summer – cello (original member) (1985–2015)\nDarol Anger – violin and baritone violin (original member) (1985–1997)\nLaurie Moore – viola (original member) (1985–1987)\nIrene Sazer – viola (1987–1990)\nKatrina Wreede – viola (1990–1992)\nJeremy Cohen – viola (1992)\nDanny Seidenberg – viola (1992–2004)\nTracy Silverman – violin (1993–1997)\nEvan Price – violin (1997–2007)\nMads Tolling – viola (2004–2007), violin (2007–2012)\nJeremy Kittel – viola (2008–2012)\nMateusz Smoczynski – violin (2012–2015)\nAlex Hargreaves – violin (2016–2018)\nMalcolm Parson – cello (2016–2021)\n\n\n== Awards ==\nGrammy Award for Best Classical Crossover Album, 4 + Four, 2005\nGrammy Award for Best Classical Crossover Album, A Love Supreme: The Legacy of John Coltrane, 2007\n\n\n== Discography ==\nTurtle Island String Quartet (Windham Hill, 1988)\nMetropolis (Windham Hill, 1989)\nSkylife (Windham Hill, 1990)\nA Shock to the System (Windham Hill, 1990)\nOn the Town (Windham Hill, 1991)\nSpider Dreams (Windham Hill, 1992)\nWho Do We Think We Are?

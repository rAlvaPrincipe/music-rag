    "text": "Two Door Cinema Club are a band formed in Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland in 2007. The band is composed of three members: Alex Trimble (vocals, rhythm guitar, beats, synths), Sam Halliday (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Kevin Baird (bass, synths, backing vocals).\nThe band's debut album, Tourist History, was released on 1 March 2010 by French independent record label Kitsuné Music. In the United States, where the band are signed to Glassnote Records, the album was released on 27 April 2010. Tourist History was selected for the Choice Music Prize for Irish Album of the Year (2010) the following year.\nThe band's second album, Beacon, was released on 3 September 2012, debuted at number one on the Irish Albums Chart and reached number two in the UK Albums Chart.\nThe band's third album, Gameshow, was released on 14 October 2016. The first single, \"Are We Ready? (Wreck)\", was released on 14 June 2016 and was debuted on Annie Mac's Hottest Record on BBC Radio 1. Two more singles, \"Bad Decisions\" and the title track, \"Gameshow\", were released prior to the album and are also included on the track list.\nTheir fourth album, False Alarm, was released on 21 June 2019 and featured the singles \"Satellite\" and \"Talk\". In the following years, they have become a frequent sight at festivals such as Reading and Leeds Festival and Glastonbury.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nTrimble and Halliday first met while attending Bangor Grammar School; the pair later met Baird while he was flirting with girls who were known to his future bandmates. The three first performed as a band at the age of 16 on ATL Rock School under the name Life Without Rory; the band finished in last place. Life Without Rory recorded three demos before disbanding; the first, \"Safe in Silence\" and the second, \"Conscripted By Choice\" are still on the band's inactive MySpace page, while the third \"You Missed the Point\" can be viewed on YouTube.\nTrimble, Halliday and Baird formed another band shortly after the demise of their first musical project; on this occasion, a permanent drummer was not included. An interim drummer by the name of Owen Bullington was appointed but was kicked out due to creative differences. The new band's name was taken from Halliday's mispronunciation of the name of the local cinema, the Tudor Cinema; in 2007, Two Door Cinema Club was formed. Following an increased interest in the band's social network page, the three members forwent their university places and commenced work on studio material.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early releases and Four Words to Stand On (2007–2009) ===\nAn EP entitled Four Words to Stand On was released on 26 March 2008 and received attention on a number of websites.

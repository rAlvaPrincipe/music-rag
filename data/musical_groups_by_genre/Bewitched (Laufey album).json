    "text": "Bewitched is the second studio album by Icelandic singer-songwriter Laufey, released on 8 September 2023 through AWAL. Described by Laufey as \"a love album, whether it be a love towards a friend or a lover or life\", Bewitched deals with a variety of romantic themes in its songs.\nMusically, Bewitched consists of jazz pop ballads, predominantly written by Laufey and collaborator Spencer Stewart, and produced by the duo along with Philharmonia Orchestra and Dan Wilson. The album was met with acclaim from music critics, who complimented the songs for their modern spin on jazz and nostalgic quality at the same time; Laufey's technical skills were also a subject of praise in the reviews. It won Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards.\nFour singles preceded the album: \"From the Start\", \"Promise\", \"Bewitched\" and \"California and Me\", the first of which marked Laufey's first song to chart on record charts. Bewitched peaked at number one on the Icelandic albums chart and was Laufey's first album to chart in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, Scotland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the album topped the Australian Jazz & Blues Albums chart. In 2024, to support the album, Laufey embarked on a worldwide concert tour.\nOn 6 March 2024, Laufey announced the reissue of the album Bewitched: The Goddess Edition, which was preceded by the single \"Goddess\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nWith the announcement, Laufey described Bewitched as \"a love album, whether it be a love towards a friend or a lover or life\". She reflected on her first album's theme of becoming an adult and contrasted it with having since \"experienced a little bit more of that, and [...] writing about the magic in the love of being young\".\nShortly prior to releasing the album, Laufey made the sheet music available to fans.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nBewitched received a score of 83 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on six critics' reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Uncut felt that \"if these [tracks] feel like throwbacks, they're no more so than Norah Jones' best work, and there's nonetheless something timeless about the breezy 'While You Were Sleeping' and, with its chugging guitars, 'Lovesick'\". In a five-star review, Hannah Mylrea of NME described Bewitched as \"confident and musically ambitious, melding jazz, pop and modern classical composition\", throughout which \"Laufey's impressive technical ability shines\".\nJames Hickey of DIY wrote that Laufey's \"crystalline voice and effortless charisma make this album into a gorgeous display of a unique talent\", which he also described as \"stuffed full of immaculate jazz ballads, shot through with luscious strings and swooning stories of hopeless love\". The Line of Best Fit's Matthew Kim opined that Laufey \"improves on her already effective formula in just about every department\", and while she does not \"reinvent the wheel when it comes to the antique jazz-pop sound that she's already mastered\", \"she certainly diversifies her palette\". Alex Ramos of Pitchfork found it to be \"bolder and more intentional\" than Everything I Know About Love as \"here, Laufey doesn't simply let jazz inform the work; she uses it as a vehicle to enact fantasies and ambitions, lending her contemporary musings a misty, out-of-time quality\".\n\n\n=== Year-end lists ===\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nBewitched debuted at number 23 on the US Billboard 200 and number 1 on the Jazz Albums charts with 23,000 album-equivalent units.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nLaufey – lead vocals\nSimon Moullier – vibraphone (track 1)\nJordan Rose – drums (track 1)\nJúnía Lín – violin (tracks 2, 3, 6)\nÞorleifur Gaukur Davíðsson – slide guitar (track 5)\nRobin O'Neill – conductor (tracks 7, 14)\nCarson Grant – drums (track 9)\nTed Case – piano (tracks 11, 16)\nJonathan Richards – bass (tracks 11, 16)\nRyan Shaw – drums (tracks 11, 16)\nHal Rosenfeld – orchestration (track 14)\nJJ Kirkpatrick – trumpet (track 16)\nTechnical\n\nLaufey – production\nSpencer Stewart – production (tracks 1–6, 10–18), additional production (9), arrangement (14), executive production\nPhilharmonia Orchestra – production (tracks 7, 14)\nJoe LaPorta – mastering\nSteve Haye – mixing\nIain Farrington – arrangement (track 7)\nDan Wilson – production (track 9)\nSara Mulford – recording (track 9)\nDaniel Ficca – recording (track 9)\nVisuals\n\nJúnía Lín – creative direction\nKelly Ford – physical packaging design\nGemma Warren – artist photography\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References =="

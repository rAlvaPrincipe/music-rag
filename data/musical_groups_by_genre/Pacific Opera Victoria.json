    "text": "Pacific Opera Victoria is a professional Canadian opera company in Victoria, British Columbia. It designs, builds, and stages original opera productions at the Royal Theatre with the Victoria Symphony. The company also presents smaller scale works and community programming at the Baumann Centre.\n\n\n== History ==\nPacific Opera Victoria emerged out of the Vancouver Island Opera Society, which staged its first production, The Marriage of Figaro, in November 1976. In 1979, the company adopted a new name, the Pacific Opera Association, and mounted its first production as a professional opera company – The Merry Wives of Windsor by Carl Otto Nicolai. In 1987 the company was renamed Pacific Opera Victoria. \nBy 1990 Pacific Opera Victoria had moved from two annual productions to three. After expanding to four mainstage productions each season from 2009 to 2012, it reverted to three productions in the Royal Theatre, complemented by chamber operas and concerts in other venues, including the Baumann Centre. \nIn response to the COVID-19 epidemic, Pacific Opera increased its online programming and began to produce and record chamber and concert works for digital distribution, including films of The Italian Lesson and Bon Appétit!     by Lee Hoiby and The Garden of Alice by Elizabeth Raum.\nPacific Opera’s founding Artistic Director, Timothy Vernon, C.M., LL.D (Hon), DMus (Hon), led the company for 43 years until his retirement in 2023. He conducted most of the company’s productions and curated an approach to repertoire that encompassed classic favourites as well as lesser known works, ranging from Baroque to contemporary operas, plus new commissions, co-productions, and collaborations with other companies.  \nAs of 2024, Pacific Opera’s leadership  includes CEO Ian Rye,  Artistic Director Brenna Corner, and Principal Conductor Giuseppe Pietraroia.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Royal Theatre ===\nPacific Opera’s productions were originally staged in the 772-seat McPherson Playhouse. By the 1990s audiences had grown to the point that a larger venue was required, and the company began to move its productions to the 1400-seat Royal Theatre, which is now the main venue for Pacific Opera’s mainstage opera productions.\n\n\n=== Baumann Centre ===\nThe opening of the Baumann Centre in 2015 provided Pacific Opera with its own venue for small-scale chamber productions as well as opera rehearsals, concerts, artist training, and community programming.\nThe Baumann Centre’s main space is Wingate Studio, a 2,500 sq ft performance space. The studio’s ceiling features a 1000 sq ft cedar installation that functions as an acoustic canopy. The installation, called Mind, Body, and Spirit, was created and donated by Kwagiulth and Coast Salish artist Carey Newman (Hayalthkin’geme), a former opera singer.  The Baumann Centre also houses Pacific Opera’s administration and box office and is used by other community groups, including the Greater Victoria Youth Orchestra and the Victoria Children’s Choir.\n\n\n=== The Opera Shop ===\nPacific Opera Victoria is notable for constructing its own sets and costumes and retaining its own production facility. In its early days the company had to construct its own sets because the small stage of the McPherson Playhouse meant that renting sets from other companies was not practicable. \nAs it grew, the company continued to build its own productions and also began to rent its productions to other companies. \nSets, costumes, and props for each production are created by a team of local theatre professionals in the company’s 10,000 sq ft  warehouse space, The Opera Shop.\n\n\n== Notable Productions ==\nPacific Opera Victoria has staged more than a dozen Canadian and world premières, including four commissioned or co-commissioned operas.\n\n\n=== Commissioned and Co-commissioned Productions ===\nThe Flight of the Hummingbird, Music by Maxime Goulet, libretto by Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas and Barry Gilson.

    "text": "Forq (pronounced \"fork\") is an American jazz fusion band from New York and Texas.\n\n\n== History ==\nForq was co-founded by keyboardist Henry Hey and Snarky Puppy member, bassist Michael League.  The original formation of the band included guitarist Adam Rogers, and drummer Jason \"JT\" Thomas. Hey, a founding  member of the band Rudder, had played a few Rudder shows, sharing the bill with Snarky Puppy before suggesting a collaboration with League, starting with a few live shows in New York City. The group's debut self-titled album was released on Snarky Puppy's label, GroundUP Music, in 2014. \nRogers left the group and was replaced by Snarky Puppy guitarist Chris McQueen early in 2015 prior to a tour of Europe. The group's sophomore album, Batch, was issued in June 2015. The group played at Snarky Puppy's GroundUp Festival in February 2017 and released a third album, Threq, in mid-2017. Since the release of Threq, bassist Michael League has been replaced by bassist Kevin Scott.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nForq (GroundUP Music, 2014)\nBatch (GroundUP Music, 2015)\nThreq (GroundUP Music, 2017)\nFour (Forq, 2019)\nAargau (Newvelle, 2019)\nFour (Remixt) (GroundUp, 2021)\nBig Party (GroundUp, 2024)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "PlatEAU is an electronic music project featuring cEvin Key and Phil Western. The project resembles a very loose approach to the Download project featuring the same members. The song names and album titles refer to the coffeeshop culture of Amsterdam in The Netherlands implying a \"trip\" through their musical voyages. The album art also reflects this concept with imagery on their first release on Hypnotic Records in 1997, Music for Grass Bars. This release had a special CD jewel case in order to create a holographic-motion effect with the cover art insert. The genre is most closely related to IDM, experimental, techno and trip hop.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1997: Music for Grass Bars\n1999: Spacecake â€“ #24 CMJ RPM Charts\n2002: Iceolator\n2007: Kushbush\n2009: Gort Spacebar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPlatEAU's Official Site\nMetropolis Records"

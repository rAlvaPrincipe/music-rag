The title of the EP and the lyrics for the lead single were taken from the poem of the same name by James Joyce, and was chosen by the duo as it mirrored their experiences of living on a house boat. The EP was produced by Ian Carter from Stick in the Wheel.\n\n\n=== Turn to Fray ===\nIn 2018, the band release their debut album entitled \"Turn to Fray\" through GFM Records.

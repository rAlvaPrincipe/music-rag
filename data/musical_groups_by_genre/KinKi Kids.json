    "text": "KinKi Kids (キンキ キッズ, Kinki kizzu) is a Japanese duo consisting of Koichi Domoto and Tsuyoshi Domoto under the talent agency Starto Entertainment (formerly of Johnny & Associates). KinKi Kids was formed in 1993 and officially debuted on July 21, 1997. With more than 30 million physical copies sold, they are one of the best selling boy groups in Asian history and top 20 best-selling artists of all time in Japan. Although the members share the same surname, the only relation they have to each other is that they both hail from the Kinki region, hence the duo's name. \nKinKi Kids holds the Guinness World Records for having the most consecutive No.1 singles since debut (45 works) and the most consecutive years with a Japanese No.1 single (26 years, 1997–2023). They have 20 No.1 albums of which 14 are consecutive, making them the artist who has the third most No.1 albums in Japan. Since 1998, the duo has held 60 concerts at Tokyo Dome, making them the artist to hold the most concerts at the Dome.\n\n\n== Members ==\nKoichi Domoto (堂本光一): born January 1, 1979, in Hyogo, Japan\nTsuyoshi Domoto (堂本剛): born April 10, 1979, in Nara, Japan\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1991–1993: Formation ===\nThe duo first met each other during a Hikaru Genji concert at Yokohama Arena on May 5, 1991. From then on, the two began to appear together in magazine photoshoots together though they did not have a formal name, going through several temporary names such as Johnny's Kansai Group, Domoto Brothers and W Domoto, before being introduced as Kanzai Boya by the end of 1992 when they were backup dancers for SMAP. On the first episode of SMAP's variety show Kiss Shita? SMAP, which began on April 4, 1993, SMAP leader Masahiro Nakai announced that their name was to be \"KinKi Kids\" when the two joined the show as regulars.\n\n\n=== 1994–1996: Breakthrough, variety shows and dramas ===\nFrom July 1994 to September 1994, Koichi and Tsuyoshi both appeared in their first drama together called Ningen Shikkaku, which had a peak rating of 28.9% on its final episode. The duo gained popularity in a short time and held their first concert at the Budokan on December 31, 1994. In 1995 and 1996, Tsuyoshi played Kindaichi in dramas Kindaichi Shōnen no Jikenbo 1 and 2, while Koichi also starred as main roles in dramas Ie Naki Ko 2  and Ginrō Kaiki File, which all achieved average rating of more than 20%.\nFrom April 1996 to June 1996, the duo once again starred together in the drama Wakaba no Koro, playing friends with very different backgrounds. Tsuyoshi played a boy with an alcoholic father who works to take care for his younger siblings while Koichi played a boy who comes from a wealthy yet unloving family. One of the most watched music varieties in Japan LOVE LOVE Aishiteru hosted by KinKi Kids and Takuro Yoshida started to air since 1996, creating a boom of studying guitar among the Japanese younger generation. The duo also had their name-entitled variety shows such as Sore Ike KinKi Daiboken and Sore Ike KinKi Daihoso in 1996. On December 31, 1996, they performed as supporting guest for Masahiko Kondō in Kohaku Uta Gassen, singing part of \"Midnight Shuffle\", which was the theme song of Koichi's drama Ginrō Kaiki File.\n\n\n=== 1997–1999: Debut and Million-selling hits ===\nDespite holding concerts and having several high-rating varieties and dramas, the duo did not make their CD debut until July 21, 1997. They debuted with a double release of a single \"Garasu no Shōnen\" and an album A Album. According to Oricon, both went on to sell over one million copies, making the duo the second artist whose first single and first album both sold over one million copies. From August 23 to August 24, they were appointed the main personality hosts for NTV's annual telethon 24-Hour Television. From October 18 to December 20, KinKi Kids starred in their third drama together called Bokura no Yūki Miman City, and the theme song \"Aisareru Yori Aishitai\", which was also their second single, was released on November 12. This single ranked No.1 for 4 weeks in Oricon in total and sold over a million copies by the end of its chart run. By the end of the year, Garasu no Shōnen ranked 2nd on the annual Oricon charts, behind Namie Amuro's \"Can You Celebrate?\".\nIn 1998, KinKi Kids, along with fellow Johnny's groups V6 and TOKIO, came together to form a special charity-oriented group called J-FRIENDS, in which they collaborated with famous musicians such as Maurice White, Diane Warren, Elton John, Jon Bon Jovi and Michael Jackson. J-FRIENDS's single \"Ashita ga Kikoeru/Children's Holiday\", released on January 21, 1998, went on to sell over a million copies and ranked 12th on the annual Oricon charts by the end of the year.\nThe duo's singles \"Zenbu Dakishimete/Ao no Jida\" released on July 29, 1998, peaked in No.1 for 4 consecutive weeks and ranked 10th on the annual charts with more than a million sales. Furthermore, their 1997 single \"Aisareru yori Aishitai\" managed to rank 8th on the annual chart. On December 31, 1998, KinKi Kids held concerts in Tokyo Dome and started to hold Tokyo Dome concerts during New Year every since until 2016. In 1999, the duo's 7th single Flower ranked 10th on the annual Oricon charts for selling over a million copies, making it the duo's fourth million-selling single. The duo was invited to perform as a special guest on Kohaku Uta Gassen on December 31, 1999.\n\n\n=== 2000–2003: Asian tours and Guinness World Record ===\nThe year 2000 saw the duo's first Asian tour in Taiwan and Hong Kong, which was held at Taipei 101 and the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre respectively and ran from February 22 to February 27, and their second million-selling album KinKi Single Selection. The duo released their 9th single \"Sukininatteku Aishitteku\" on March 8, 2000, with the lyrics written by Tsuyoshi and the music composed by Koichi, reaching No.1 in Oricon, making them the first Japanese idol artist to have a No.1 single composed by oneself.\nAfter all 13 of KinKi Kids' singles since their debut  ranked the first in Oricon, they were listed in the 2002 edition of the reference book Guinness World Records for having the record of the most consecutive number-one singles since their debut single. It was the first case for a musical artist in Japan to be recognized by the Guinness World Records. Irish group Westlife was listed as this record holder by the Guinness World Records before the duo's accreditation because of making seven consecutive UK number-one singles since their debut as a group.\nFrom December 26, 2002, to July 28, 2003, KinKi Kids held their first five dome tour \"KinKi Kids Dome F Concert 〜Fun Fan Forever\" in Tokyo Dome, Osaka Dome, Nagoya Dome, Fukuoka Dome and Sapporo Dome.\n\n\n=== 2004–2006: \"Anniversary\" and KinKi Single Selection II ===\nOn December 24, 2004, KinKi Kids released their 20th single \"Anniversary\" and second compilation album KinKi Single Selection II, both ranked the first in Oricon's single and album chart.

Moreover, \"Anniversary\" managed to rank the 6th on the 2005 annual chart. The duo held concerts \"KinKi Kids H TOUR -Have A Nice Day-\" at Osaka Dome and Tokyo Dome from December 24, 2005, to January 1, 2006. With 24 concerts held at Tokyo Dome, they overtook The Rolling Stones to become the artist to hold the most concerts at the Dome.\n\n\n=== 2007–2008: 10th anniversary ===\nTo commemorate their 10th anniversary on July 21, 2007, KinKi Kids released a best-hits album entitled 39 on July 18, 2007. The numbers three and nine are pronounced as \"San Kyū\" (三九) in Japanese and sound similar to \"Thank You\" in English, signifying KinKi Kids' gratitude to their fans for their support for the past 10 years. The album features the top 11 song favorites, as voted by fans as well as two individual 14-song favorites lists from Koichi and Tsuyoshi, coming to a total of 39 songs, hence the title. 39 went on to sell about 301,000 copies in its first week.

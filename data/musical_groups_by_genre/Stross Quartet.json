    "text": "The  Stross-Quartett (formerly \"Quartet of the Cologne Student Period\" and \"Grümmer Quartet\") was an important German string quartet from Cologne (1922-1931) and Munich (1934-1966) respectively. The quartet was named after the long-time primarius Wilhelm Stross.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was in the tradition of Joseph Joachim and, like the Klingler Quartet, the Busch Quartet, the Havemann Quartet, the Amar Quartet, the Wendling Quartet and the Strub Quartet, influenced decisively the German string quartet scene in the first half of the 20th century.\nDuring the Second World War the members of the quartet were exempted from military service, which was a rarity. From 1940 the string quartet often played at Wehrmacht concerts. It also performed at NSDAP and Kraft durch Freude events and in military hospitals.\nThe ensemble was also able to continue its activities in Allied-occupied Germany. After the Second World War, the Stross Quartet became the most important German string quartet alongside the Koeckert Quartet.  International concert tours led the ensemble through Europe as well as to Asia, Africa and South America. In the early 1960s the Goethe-Institut organized concerts in Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Cyprus and Greece. The quartet also performed with important foreign actors such as the Paris Loewenguth Quartet and the Vienna Philharmonic Wind Ensemble.\nAfter the death of the founder in 1966, Ingo Sinnhoffer wound up the Stross Quartet. The violinist Josef Märkl and the cellist Rudolf Metzmacher founded the Märkl Quartet in 1968, continuing the tradition of the Stross Quartet.\nThe repertoire of the ensemble was very broad (among others Bach, Bartók, Reger, Blacher, Brahms, Bruckner, Dvořák, Fasch, Gál, Grieg, Haydn, Hindemith, Humperdinck, Pfizner, Ravel, Respighi, Smetana, Schumann, Verdi and Viotti). Above all, the cyclical performances of the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert are of particular importance. Throughout its history the string quartet has performed premieres of modern compositions by Martin Karl Hasse, Oscar von Pander, Richard Trunk and Mordechai Sheinkman.\nThe Stross Quartet has made several recordings and radio broadcasts.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe string quartet was recast several times, with Wilhelm Stross almost always being Primarius:\n\n1.

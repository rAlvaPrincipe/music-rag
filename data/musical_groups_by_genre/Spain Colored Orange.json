    "text": "Spain Colored Orange is an indie rock band from Houston, Texas. The group formed in 2000, was signed by Lucid Records from 2005 to 2008 and then represented by Shout It Out Loud Music through 2012. Their sound has been characterized as a blend of indie rock and indie pop with elements of psychedelic rock, '70s rock, swing and jazz.\nKnown for energetic live performances, Spain Colored Orange has performed with Modest Mouse, Ben Kweller, The Octopus Project, The Fiery Furnaces, Of Montreal, Ra Ra Riot and Trail of Dead.

The band has toured nationally and consecutively featured in large-scale regional festivals including South by Southwest and Free Press Summer Fest.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was established in 2000 as a solo project by frontman Gilbert Alfaro, former founding member of Houston-based national-touring bands Blueprint/In Echoes and Refuse To Fall.\nOther original members joined after they heard Alfaro's initial taped recordings. The band was originally called \"8 Track Charade,\" but changed their name just days before signing a record deal with Lucid Records. According to Alfaro, the band's final name, Spain Colored Orange, originated from an elementary school project that his grandmother had hanging in her house.\nAfter signing with Lucid Records in 2005, the band released their debut EP Hopelessly Incapable of Standing in the Way.\nThey ultimately negotiated a break from their contract with Lucid Records in 2008, while in the process of recording a freshman full-length at Houston's historic Sugar Hill Studios. The group signed with Shout It Out Loud Music and released that first full-length record, Sneaky Like a Villain, in 2009.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\n\nGilbert Alfaro (vocals, electric piano, synths)\nWill Evans (guitar, vocals)\nJared Arceneaux (bass guitar)\nKeith Palumbo (percussion)\nCoy Matula (guitar, synths, vocals)\nFormer members\n\nJames Diederich (percussion)\nJustin Peak (synth, sample)\nMikey Deleon\nRandy Platt (guitars)\nRyan Chavez\nSteven Burnett (bass, mouth harp)\nSteve Torres (percussion)\nMike Dugat (guitar)\nBen Jarrad (guitar, banjo, vox, & ukulele)\nSteve Aikey (bass)\nEric Jackson (trumpet)\nErica Cruz (guitar, synths, electric piano, vocals)\nBill Matney (studio percussionist)\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHouston Press Music Awards:\n\nAlbum of the Year (Hopelessly Incapable of Standing in the Way, 2006)\nBest Indie Rock (2006, 2008, 2009)\nBest Keyboardist (Gilbert Alfaro, 2006, 2008)\nLocal Musician of the Year (2006)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHopelessly Incapable of Standing in the Way (EP, 2005)\nSneaky Like a Villain (Album, 2009)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpain Colored Orange on SoundCloud\nSpain Colored Orange on iTunes\nSpain Colored Orange's channel on YouTube\nSpain Colored Orange's iHeartRADIO Page\nSpain Colored Orange on Myspace\nShout It Out Loud Music official website"

He came up with the stage name 3Bubble from a moniker for the 3rd Degree in which he wrote out the number three and with a numerical degree sign. He turned this unique marker into the word \"bubble\" to ensure it was hard to forget.\nJ. Gray is a rapper who attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts for two years to study music but ultimately graduated from Westside High School. Gray realized that he was not only a talented singer but also a good freestyle rapper during battles against his peers.\nAs 3Bubble & J.

Dave Fellows, formerly of Pacific Ocean Fire and motion film soundtrack composing partner of Tearse joined shortly after before Tiernan Welch of defunct Public Relations Exercise joined later that year.\nAfter a short period of gigging and 'viral propaghanda' created by design firm wetheconspirators  the band quickly received praise and response from left-field specialist radio luminaries featuring on BBC Introducing as well as John Kennedy XFM, Adam Walton BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio 1.

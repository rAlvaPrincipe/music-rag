    "text": "Split Enz were a New Zealand band formed in 1972. Regarded as the first New Zealand band to gain significant recognition outside of Australasia, they were initially noted for their progressive/art rock sound, flamboyant visual style and theatrical performances. The band later moved toward a pop/new wave sound that yielded the breakthrough hit single \"I Got You\" (1980). Split Enz broke up in 1984. Since that time, the band has staged several brief reunions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Tim Finn/Phil Judd era (1972–1977) ===\nOriginally named Split Ends, presumably referencing split ends of hairs, the band were formed by songwriters Tim Finn (vocals) and Phil Judd (guitar/vocals). The original line-up was completed by Mike Chunn (bass), Miles Golding (violin) and Mike Howard (flute), with the band making their first live appearance on 10 December 1972, at the Wynyard Tavern in Auckland, New Zealand. At the beginning of 1973, they were joined by drummer Div Vercoe, though within a few months, Vercoe, Golding and Howard had all departed, with Finn, Judd and Chunn recruiting Wally Wilkinson on guitar and Chunn's brother Geoff on drums. Keyboardist Eddie Rayner and saxophonist Rob Gillies were also added in early 1974, around which time the band altered their name to Split Enz, with the \"nz\" in the name referring to New Zealand.\nDuring 1973 and 1974, the group recorded three singles, \"For You\", \"The Sweet Talking Spoon Song\" and \"No Bother to Me\" (the latter not being released until 1975). Those singles, and their B-sides, along with several demos from this period, would later be released as The Beginning of the Enz album in 1979. Later in 1974, Rob Gillies and Geoff Chunn left the band, with the latter being replaced by Emlyn Crowther, while Noel Crombie also joined as percussionist and the band's visual director. In the early years of Split Enz, they were known as an \"adventurous, flamboyant art-rock band\" with unique, theatrical live shows. In 1975, the band moved to Australia and recorded their first album Mental Notes, which reached No. 7 in New Zealand and No. 35 in Australia. Shortly after the album's release, Wilkinson departed and Rob Gillies re-joined.\nIn 1976, the band moved to England, where they recorded their second album Second Thoughts, produced by Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera. While in the UK, the band toured as support to English folk-rockers Jack the Lad. Crowther left the band in late 1976 and was replaced by Malcolm Green.\n\n\n=== Tim Finn/Neil Finn era (1977–1984) ===\nPhil Judd and Mike Chunn left the band in 1977. Tim Finn's brother, Neil Finn, joined as Judd's replacement on 7 April 1977, while Nigel Griggs replaced Chunn on bass. Over time, as well as being the band's guitarist, Neil Finn became their co-lead singer and a key songwriter, both alongside his brother Tim. Split Enz' third album, Dizrythmia, was recorded at London's AIR Studios with producer, and former Beatles engineer, Geoff Emerick, from June to July 1977. The album was released in August 1977. At the beginning of 1978, Gillies left the band. An attempted reunion with Phil Judd lasted around a month before he departed for the second and final time, after which the remaining members continued as a six-piece.\nBy mid 1978, Split Enz had no agent, no manager, and no record contract. The New Zealand Arts Council gave the band a grant of $5,000. The grant money was used to book studio time, and the band used that time to record what became known as the \"Rootin' Tootin' Luton Tapes\". One of the songs the band recorded was called \"I See Red\". Released as a single later that year, \"I See Red\" marked a significant move away from the band's early progressive/art rock style, towards high-energy, guitar-based power pop. While \"I See Red\" did not chart in England, it did bring the band critical attention. The single peaked at No. 15 in New Zealand.\n\nThe group went home to New Zealand for Christmas 1978. Just after Christmas, there was a serious setback when their equipment was destroyed in a suspicious fire at a rehearsal studio. Using borrowed equipment, Split Enz played what proved to be a pivotal concert, stunning friends and fans alike with a legendary performance at the second Nambassa Festival in January 1979. The band released their fourth album Frenzy in 1979.\n\nTrue Colours, released in 1980, further marked the band's shift to a \"power pop\" style. The hit single \"I Got You\" reached No. 1 in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, No. 12 in the United Kingdom, and No. 53 in the United States. True Colours reached No. 1 on the album charts in Australia and New Zealand and made the Top 40 in both the UK and the US.\nSplit Enz's next album, 1981's Waiata, released as Corroboree in Australia, reached No. 1 in Australia and New Zealand. After the album's completion, Malcolm Green departed, and the band continued as a five-piece, with Noel Crombie moving from percussionist to drummer. The next album, 1982's Time and Tide, reached No. 1 in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. One of the album's songs, \"Six Months in a Leaky Boat\", was listed as the fifth-best New Zealand song of all time in the 2001 Australasian Performing Right Association, but the song became controversial in England because it was perceived as a criticism of the Falklands War.\nAfter releasing Conflicting Emotions in 1983, the band became a six-piece again with the addition of drummer Paul Hester, while Crombie returned to his previous role of percussionist. In the spring of 1984, Tim Finn left the band for a solo career, following the success of his first solo album Escapade the previous year. Neil Finn assumed the role of band leader and main songwriter, but felt uncomfortable continuing the band without either of its founders Tim Finn or Phil Judd. It was decided their next album See Ya 'Round would be their last. Following the album's release, Tim Finn re-joined for a final farewell tour. Split Enz played their final show on 6 December 1984 at Logan Campbell Centre in Auckland, after which they officially split.\nNeil Finn and Paul Hester went on to form a new band called the Mullanes with bassist Nick Seymour. They had changed their name to Crowded House by the time their self-titled first album was released in 1986, going on to achieve worldwide success. Tim Finn also joined Crowded House as a fourth member from 1989 to 1991, during which time the band recorded and released their third album Woodface.\n\n\n=== Reunions ===\nIn 1986, two years after Split Enz broke up, they reunited for a Greenpeace benefit concert. That was followed by a pair of concerts in Australia in 1989/1990. The first of those performances was scheduled for 28 December 1989 at the Newcastle Worker's Club. However, the club was virtually destroyed that morning by an earthquake. The band instead appeared at a benefit concert in February 1990 which raised funds to support the town's recovery.\nThe band reunited in 1993 for their twentieth anniversary tour, during which they played at Christchurch, Wellington, and Auckland, supported by The Holy Toledos. They appeared on TV in 2002 to celebrate their thirtieth anniversary. In 2006, Split Enz toured with a membership consisting of the classic 1978–1981 line-up of Tim Finn, Neil Finn, Nigel Griggs, Eddie Rayner, Noel Crombie, and Malcolm Green.\nAnother reunion tour followed in March 2008, with four shows in New Zealand. A one-off reunion performance took place on 14 March 2009, as part of the Sound Relief festival.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nIn total, Split Enz had ten albums (including seven studio albums) reach the top 10 of the Official New Zealand Music Chart. They have had eight songs listed in the APRA Top 100 New Zealand Songs of All Time, more than any other band.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nTim Finn – vocals, acoustic guitar, piano (1972–1984, 1984; plus reunions in 1986, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009)\nPhil Judd – vocals, guitar, mandolin (1972–1977, 1978)\nMike Chunn – bass, backing vocals (1972–1977; plus reunions in 1992 and 2002)\nMiles Golding – violin (1972–1973)\nMike Howard – flute (1972–1973)\nDiv Vercoe – drums (1973)\nWally Wilkinson – guitar, backing vocals (1973–1975)\nGeoff Chunn – drums (1973–1974; plus reunions in 1992 and 2002)\nEddie Rayner – keyboards, piano, backing vocals (1974–1984; plus reunions in 1986, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009)\nRob Gillies – saxophone (1974, 1975–1978; plus reunions in 1992 and 2002)\nEmlyn Crowther – drums (1974–1976; plus reunions in 1992 and 2002)\nNoel Crombie – percussion, drums, backing vocals (1974–1984; plus reunions in 1986, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009)\nMalcolm Green – drums, backing vocals (1976–1981; plus reunions in 2005 and 2006)\nNeil Finn – vocals, guitar, mandolin (1977–1984; plus reunions in 1986, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009)\nNigel Griggs – bass, backing vocals (1977–1984; plus reunions in 1986, 1989, 1993, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009)\nPaul Hester – drums, backing vocals (1983–1984; plus reunions in 1986, 1989, 1993 and 1999) (died 2005)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\n\nMental Notes (1975)\nSecond Thoughts (1976, titled Mental Notes outside Australasia)\nDizrythmia (1977)\nFrenzy (1979)\nThe Beginning of the Enz (1979, recorded 1973–1974)\nTrue Colours (1980)\nWaiata (1981, titled Corroboree in Australia)\nTime and Tide (1982)\nConflicting Emotions (1983)\nSee Ya 'Round (1984)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== ARIA Music Awards ===\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music.

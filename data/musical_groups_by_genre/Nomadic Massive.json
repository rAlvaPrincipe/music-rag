    "text": "Nomadic Massive is an independent Canadian hip-hop supergroup based in Montreal that has been active since 2004.  The group has performed in Canada, the United States, Brazil, and France, among other international venues. The ensemble rotates members depending on the song, but their membership includes rappers, singers, keyboardists, saxophonists, trumpeters, trombonists, guitarists, bass players, and drummers. Many of them are multi-instrumentalists and trade spots onstage. \nThe group's current roster includes Waahli, Butta Beats, Lou Piensa, and Ali Sepu. Alongside them, other musicians include bassist Mark Haynes, keyboardist JMF, drummer T-cup, and singer-songwriter Malia Laura. \nNomadic Massive writes songs in English, French, Spanish, and Haitian Creole. The group's genre is characterized as an Afro-Latin take on hip-hop. They have performed at Montreal International Jazz Festival for several years. \n\n\n== Band biography ==\n\nIn 2004, a collective made up of solo artists was created in Montreal in order to participate in a hip-hop festival in Havana, Cuba. After spending three weeks living together with music as the main focus and sharing moments with Cuban artists, the group came back to Montreal with the idea of putting together a mixtape and a show in order to showcase their experience. The night of the concert, the venue quickly packed up, and the mixtapes rapidly sold out. The next day, Nomadic Massive decided to push the experience even further by participating in any community shows between Montreal and Toronto.\nIn 2005, the group launched its first EP Nomad’s Land. The record was critically acclaimed in the local and international scenes and Nomadic Massive started to create its own niche. As of 2024, over 3,000 copies have been sold.\nThe group subsequently continued to perform at various events across Canada and later returned to Havana in 2006 to present their new material and their new live show. In 2008, the group managed to independently organize a tour in São Paulo, Brazil, where their music and community workshops found a new fan base and where they produced a new mixtape with local artists, catching the attention of the record label Outside Music, which, in 2009, offered Nomadic Massive a national distribution deal for their second self-titled album, which sold more than 4500 copies.\nIn 2012, the group released a mixtape project entitled Supafam, which came out digitally but also on 300 exclusive cassette tapes. During that time, the group continued to tour in new areas, such as French Guiana and the United States.\nThe arrival of a new EP in 2013 announced the beginning of a tour across Canada, the United States, and France.\nIn 2016, after years of international touring, Nomadic Masiive launched a new album on the Coop Les Faux-Monnayeurs record label The Big Band Theory, a release that included soul, jazz, and funk music. This album opened new markets particularly in Europe and Latin America.\nFrom 2017 to 2019, the band heavily toured Europe twice a year (France, Germany, Switzerland, and Spain) and recorded and released an EP (Miwa, 2018) and a full-length album (Times, 2019). They were also chosen as one of the bands that represented Canada at the Cervantino Festival in Mexico. Just before the COVID-19 Pandemic, they have celebrated their 15-year anniversary with a sold-out show in Montreal in the context of the Mundial Montreal showcase.\nIn 2022, the band began touring internationally again with a week-long project in Paraguay, where they recorded and released a live session of a new song called \"Pocket Full of Lingo.\" This was followed by shows in New York and Marseille at international showcases. A second single, \"Fly Sh*t,\" entirely shot in Marseille, was released in July 2023 as they toured Mexico at the Querétaro Experimental festival. A new EP was released in the second half of 2023.\n\n\n== Performance highlights ==\n\nQueretaro Experimental (Queretaro, Mexico)\nBABEL XP (Marseille, France)\nAPAP NYC+ (New York, US)\nCervantino Festival (Guanajuato, Mexico)\nFestival de Marseille (Marseille, France)\nFusion Fest (Lars, Germany)\nCelebrate Brooklyn!

He had a nomadic childhood, born in France and raised in Ecuador, Algeria, Canada, and Cuba. Active in the international hip-hop scene since his teenage years, Piensa has been involved in many aspects of the movement, including radio, music production, performance, and event organization. His music had him travel and share the stage with world-renowned artists (Common, Wyclef Jean, Dead Prez, K'naan, Julian Marley), particularly with Nomadic Massive. Piensa speaks multiple languages and his raps are frequently mixed with French, English, Spanish, and Portuguese.\nLou Piensa is one half of The Loop Pilots, a collaborative beat-making duo founded in 2015 with his former English student and established producer, Dr. MaD. \nIn 2007,  NoBad Sound Studio, a music studio for youths, was founded in affiliation with Maison des Jeunes Côte-des-Neiges, where Piensa, alongside bandmate Butta Beats, was hired to conduct workshops.\nIn 2016, the two would help create Up Next Studio at James Lyng High School.\n\n\n=== Waahli ===\nWaahli (also known as Wyzah) was born in Montreal to Haitian parents. His father, also a musician, knew at an early age that music would play an intricate part of his life. As a solo artist and member of Nomadic Massive, he is a self-taught rapper, freeslylist and guitarist. Waahli has shared the stage with acts such as Guru, Antibalas, Yasiin Bey, Georgia Anne Muldrow, Blackalicious, K’naan, and Wyclef Jean. His musical styles and influences range from traditional to soul, funk, and jazz. He has cited the Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, J Dilla, and KRS-One as inspirations. Beyond his musical influences, Waahli also derives inspiration from the work of black activists such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X. More recently, he has been exploring skills as a beatmaker, releasing the instrumental EP series Soapfactory Volumes 1 (2011) and 2 (2012), which he showcased at Artbeat Montreal Revelation in 2012.\nWaahli is also a father, a grassroots community builder, a youth worker, and a soap maker (Wyzah Musk).\n\n\n=== Ali Sepu ===\nAli Sepu is an Ottawa-born musician. Sepu has been in the music industry since the age of twelve, when he received his first guitar from his father. He proceeded to become involved in many Chilean cultural events, which served as a training ground for his unique guitar style. He was influenced by the traditional music of the Andes, as well as the blues and the psychedelic music of the 1970s. He later discovered his interest in the hip-hop genre, which he chose to attempt. Hip-hop expanded his musical repertoire as he explored new styles emanating from the diverse cultures in the Montreal music scene. Although his original loops were done on the same classical guitar he received as a child, he opted for a Japanese Stratocaster when the group decided to go with a live band.\n\n\n=== Butta Beats ===\nButta Beats is an Argentinian beatboxer, emcee, multi-instrumentalist, producer, songwriter, and educator. Butta Beats was often seen and heard in countless freestyle sessions and beat-boxing encounters at concerts, on street corners, and on the radio. He was part of the WEFUNK Radio with DJ Static and Professor Groove. He also collaborated with Ali Sepu on the Iron Chef Project, which allowed him to integrate his South American folkloric influences with occidental urban music. Joining Nomadic Massive gave him the medium to express positive social discourse through music.\nIn 2007, NoBad Sound Studio was founded in affiliation with Maison des Jeunes Côte-des-Neiges, where Butta Beats, alongside bandmate Piensa, were hired to conduct workshops.\nIn 2016, the two would help create Up Next Studio at James Lyng High School.\n\n\n== Past members ==\n\n\n=== Nantali Indongo ===\nNantali Indongo (who also goes by Tali, IamBlackgirl, IBG, or Taliwah) is a Caribbean singer, songwriter, and MC.

She is also the daughter of activist Kennedy Frederick, who was one of the six original plaintiffs and a leader in the infamous Sir George Williams Affair, a series of protests held at Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) in the 1960s after the administration failed to address students’ claims that a professor at the school, Perry Anderson, was guilty of racism; these events make the subject of the 2015 documentary film Ninth Floor, in which Indongo stars.\nIndongo is also the co-founder of Hip Hop No Pop, an educational and interactive workshop series that looks at the non-violent origins of hip hop culture and uses hip hop as a tool to encourage storytelling and foster confidence in youth.

Fluent in Arabic and French, she learned English through long hours of religiously listening to Wu-Tang Clan, Big L, Fugees, Public Enemy, Dead Prez, and other influential hip-hop artists. Her love for hip-hop comes from the genre’s tradition of encouraging social critique and free speech. She joined Nomadic Massive in 2005 after recognizing the group’s passion for music and positive social change.\nWhile mentoring young women and facilitating singing workshops at La Maison des Jeunes de Côte-des-Neiges, she obtained a degree in commerce, a license in real estate, and began her bachelor's degree in political science.

Both DJs play a symbiotic mix of funk, soul, R&B, and rap, both old and new. The name of the radio show comes from the Parliaments' song \"P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up),\" in which WEFUNK is a fictional radio station broadcasting \"directly from the Mothership, top of the Chocolate Milky Way, 500,000 kilowatts of P Funk power.\" The Internet radio stream in 1999 became one of the oldest continuously operating radio streams on the Internet, as well as one of the longest-running online radio shows.\nDJ Static became the DJ for the Canadian multicultural multilingual hip-hop group Nomadic Massive.

The youth center is located in the Côte-des-Neiges neighborhood, part of the Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough, the most populous and culturally diverse in Montreal. In 2007, Butta Beats and Lou Piensa would be brought on by the Maison des Jeunes to facilitate workshops in the new NoBad Sound Studio, just under their own rehearsal studio. NoBad Sound Studio, affiliated with the Maison des Jeunes, was developed with the intention of offering young budding musicians a place where they can develop their musical talents and express themselves artistically. The space offers neighborhood youth a wide variety of music workshops each week that include beatboxing, rap, speech writing, singing lessons, music production, DJing, and performance skills.\nIn 2009, the studio began producing professional-quality music published on CD. This initiative offered young artists the opportunity to work directly with professional staff to create, record, and develop musical projects that express socially conscious lyrics. In 2010, the studio began expanding its activities outside of Montreal, which gave them the opportunity to bring five youths to Toronto, ON, after being invited to play and speak at the Regent Park International Film Festival. The studio intends to create international exchanges with marginalized youth around the world in the near future.\n\nIn 2014, NBS launched their first all-girl initiative, with the result being a trio of singers, songwriters, and beatmakers, Strange Froots.  As the most successful act to have come out of NBS to date, Sambou would go on to call them \"the pride of NoBad Sound Studio and of the Maison des Jeunes\" in an interview with France Ô and Outre-Mer 1ère.\n\n\n=== Strange Froots ===\nStrange Froots, founded in 2014, is the first all-girl group to have formed at NBS.  The group, composed of Mags, Naïka Champaïgne (having attended NBS since 2013), and SageS (from 2014 to 2020), takes its name from the Billie Holiday song \"Strange Fruit\". As Nomadic Massive's protégés, they have made waves in the Montreal hip-hop scene, having released their eponymous first EP at the Hip Hop You Don't Stop festival in September 2014 with Tali as one of the fellow acts, only 3 months after their first meeting.  Tali, Waahli, and Piensa would open for their first music video launch in February 2015.  Since their inception, they have performed in many different venues and festivals across Montreal, such as WE Day, the St-Ambroise Montreal Fringe Festival, POP Montreal, and RIDM.  Their second EP, Blossom This Froot For Thought, was released in July 2016 through Concordia University's official campus and community radio station CJLO, by way of their OnRotation artist residency.  The second EP has charted across Canada in the top 10 in hip-hop for most of Fall 2016 on campus and community radio. In 2017, the group was brought on by Colonelle Films to provide the score for their short film Mahalia Melts in the Rain, released in 2018.\nThe group would announce in the spring of 2021 that SageS was no longer part of the band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nTimes (2019)\nThe Big Band Theory (2016)\nNomadic Massive (2009)\nNomad's Land (2006)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nMIWA (2018)\nAny Sound (2013)\nNomads Land EP (2005)\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\nThe Radio-Tape (2015)\nThe Brazil-Canada Get-down (2008)\nThe Canada-Cuba Get-Down (2004)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/B66906\nhttp://www.montrealjazzfest.com/artists/artist.aspx?id=350\nhttp://www.festivalnuitsdafrique.com/en/artist/nomadic-massive"

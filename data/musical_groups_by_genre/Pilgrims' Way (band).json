The band's influences are varied but they share a deep respect for the tradition and take as their inspiration some of the most influential bands from the 1960s/1970s revival.\nNamed for the Rudyard Kipling poem, set to music by Peter Bellamy, their self-stated aim is to \"present gimmick-free English folk of the finest kind\".\nThe five band members, Edwin Beasant, Jude Rees, Tom Kitching, Jon Loomes and Heather Sirrel play a wide range of instruments, often changing between them many times during sessions, which enables the band to play a diverse repertoire of music.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2011 - FATEA Magazine Tradition award winner\n2012 - Spiral Earth Debut album award - nominee\n2012 - BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards New Horizons award - nominee\n\n\n== Discography ==\nPilgrims' Way EP (2011)\nWayside Courtesies (2011)\nShining Gently All Around EP (2011)\nRed Diesel (2016)\nStand & Deliver (2017)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBand website"

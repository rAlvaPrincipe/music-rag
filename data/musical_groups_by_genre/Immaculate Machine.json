    "text": "Immaculate Machine was a Canadian indie pop band from Victoria, British Columbia, active from 2003 to 2011.\nThe band's name is taken from the lyrics of \"One-Trick Pony\" from the album One-Trick Pony by Paul Simon.\n\n\n== History ==\nImmaculate Machine was a trio in 2003 consisting of Brooke Gallupe, Kathryn Calder and Luke Kozlowski.  The band released The View and Transporter independently before signing to label Mint Records in early 2005.\nTheir Mint Records debut, Ones and Zeros, came out on September 6, 2005, and they supported the album with a tour of Canada and the United States. That year, Calder became a member of The New Pornographers, appearing on the album Twin Cinema and touring with the band. She is the niece of New Pornographers leader A.C. Newman.\nIn early June 2007, the band's song \"Jarhand\", the first single from their third album Immaculate Machine's Fables, was featured as the iTunes free single of the week.\nIn 2009, Kozlowski left the band and was replaced by Aden Collinge. \nAs well, due to family commitments, Calder was unable to tour the band's latest album, High on Jackson Hill. To compensate for this, a touring band was formed consisting of Caitlin Gallupe, Brooke's sister, Jordan Minkoff, bandmate of Caitlin in Slam Dunk, and occasionally Leslie Rewega.\n\n\n== Members ==\nBrooke Gallupe (2003–2011)\nKathryn Calder (2003–2011)\nLuke Kozlowski (2003–2009)\nAden Collinge (2009–2011)\nCaitlin Gallupe (2009–2011)\nJordan Minkoff (2009–2011)\nLeslie Rewega (2009–2011)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nWon't Be Pretty (7\" single) (2008)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nThe View (2003)\nLes Uns Mais Pas Les Autres (2006)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nTransporter (2004)\nOnes and Zeros (2005)\nImmaculate Machine's Fables (2007)\nHigh on Jackson Hill (2009)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCanadian rock\nList of Canadian musicians\nList of bands from Canada\nList of bands from British Columbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nImmaculate Machine"

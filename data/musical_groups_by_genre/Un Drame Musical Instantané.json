    "text": "Un Drame Musical Instantané, since its creation in 1976, featuring Jean-Jacques Birgé, Bernard Vitet and Francis Gorgé, has decided to promote collective musical creation, co-signing their albums, which they consider as artworks in themselves, or their live shows which they try to renew every time they play.\n\n\n== History ==\nThey borrowed their sources from rock (synthesizer player Birgé and guitarist Gorgé, both authors of the album, Défense de); jazz (trumpeter Vitet who founded the first free jazz band in France, together with François Tusques, as well as Michel Portal who played with many American and European jazzmen); classical modern music; as well as movies or world news; they were the first in France to give a new impetus to live music on silent movies.\nTwenty four creations were in their repertoire, among which were Caligari by Robert Wiene, La glace à trois faces and La chute de la Maison Usher by Jean Epstein, The passion of Joan of Arc by Carl Dreyer, Man with a Movie Camera by Dziga Vertov, and L'argent by Marcel L'Herbier. After having improvised freely for many years, they led a fifteen piece orchestra from 1981 to 1986, and since 1989 they have produced multimedia shows (live video remix on a giant screen, fireworks, choreographies), but their most convincing musical theater was mainly audio, which they have called \"blind cinema\". The Drame used to mix acoustic and electronic instruments in real time as well as original instruments built by Vitet (a reed trumpet, a multiphonic French horn, a variable tension double-bass, a giant balafon with frying pans and flower pots keyboard, a fire organ, plexiglas flutes, etc.)\nAfter Francis Gorgé has left the band in 1992, Birgé and Vitet went on recording and producing with other musicians close to the \"family\" such as percussionist, Gérard Siracusa, or multi-instrumentalist, Hélène Sage. Un Drame Musical Instantané which has always remain independent (they have always owned their own recording studio and record label GRRR) stopped its activities in 2008, Birgé remaining the only one on the music scene. And Vitet died on July 3, 2013.\nHowever, Un Drame Musical Instantané has come back on stage in 2014, featuring Birgé, Gorgé, Sage, plus several guests, and Birgé Gorgé got back together with writer Dominique Meens in 2022 and live with Amandine Casadamont on turntables in 2023.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nTrès toxique (GRRR / also on Toxic Rice, Psych.KG, D) 1976 (issued 2023)\nTrop d'adrénaline nuit (GRRR, France), 1977 (issued 1979) - CD reissue+bonus+DVD (Mio, Israel), 2001 - LP reissue+DVD (Wah-Wah, Spain), 2013\nRideau !

    "text": "Love is Colder Than Death, commonly abbreviated LiCTD or LICTD, is an early German neoclassical dark wave band that was one of the cornerstones to Hyperium Records' Heavenly Voices compilation series of the early 1990s. It is named after the 1969 Fassbinder film Liebe ist kälter als der Tod. The band's music is characterized by its extensive use of both romantic and classical styled male and female vocals. Founded by Ralf Donis, Maik Hartung, Sven Mertens, and Susann Heinrich in 1990, the band members and music have changed slightly since then. The first few LICTD albums were released on the Hyperium record label in Europe and on the new Metropolis Records label in the United States.\nThe band's album Teignmouth was the first Metropolis Records release, and remains one of LICTD's more popular albums.  Following the departure of Donis, the more experimental songs that characterized some of the early LICTD work gave way to a much more classical sound.  Eclipse, the latest LICTD album with new content, reached number one on Mexican New Age Sales Charts.\nAt present, the band is based in Leipzig, Germany.  The band performed at major international festivals including, Wave-Gotik-Treffen in 2003 and 2005 and the annual Bach Festival Leipzig in 2003.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Full length albums and EPs ===\nWild World Hyperium vinyl EP (1991)\nTeignmouth Hyperium Records / Metropolis Records (1991)\nMental Traveller Hyperium / Metropolis Records (1992)\nOxeia Hyperium / Metropolis Records (1994)\nSpellbound Hyperium CDS (1995)\nAtopos Chrom (1999)\nEclipse In Deyagora Music (2003)\nTempest In Deyagora Music (2013)\n\n\n=== Special releases ===\nTwo Faces But No Guitars (1990) — MC limited to 20 copies\nAuter Hyperium (1995) — collection CD\nInside the Bell (2004) — live album limited\nTime (2006) 2CD In Deyagora Music—collection CD limited to 1,000 copies\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nRomantic Sound Sampler III Zillo (1991)\nBouquet of Dreams Dark Star (1991)\nFrom Hypnotic Hyperium (1992)\nHyperium Promotional Sampler Hyperium (1992)\nOxeia on Heavenly Voices Part 2 Hyperium (1993)\nBorderline Messerschmitt (1993)\nWe Came to Dance Vol. 1 Sub Terranean (1993)\nArt and Dance Vol. 4 Gothic Arts (1993)\nThe Fallen Angel Zoth Ommog (1994)\nAffaire de Coeur (1994)\nHeavenly Voices III Hyperium (1995)\nZauber of Music Vol. II Hyperium (1995)\nMoonraker Vol. II Sub Terranean (1995)\nElectrocity Vol. 6 Ausfahrt (1995)\nGerman Mystic Sound Sampler Vol. V Zillo (1995)\nMiroque Sub Terranean (1996)\nTouched By The Hand Of Goth Vol. II Sub Terranean (1996)\nThe City In the Sea on Goth Box Disk 3 Cleopatra (1996)\nHyperium New Classics Vol. 1 Hyperium (1997)\nLove and Solitude on The Black Bible 4CD Cleopatra (1998)\nWild World on Orkus Presents The Best Of The 90s 3 2CD Orkus (2003)\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Studio and Live ===\nRalf Donis (1990–1993) — vocals\nMaik Hartung (1990–present) — strings/percussion/keyboards\nSven Mertens (1990–1993, 1997–2011) — backing vocals/percussion/keys\nSusann Porter / Heinrich (1990–1995, 2001–2011) — vocals\nAndrew Porter (1993–1995)- drums, vocals\nManuela Budich (1997–2000) — vocals\nHelen Landen (2000–2001) — vocals (live)\nRalf Jehnert (1997–present) — vocals\nAnja Herrmann (2012–2013) — Vocals/Percussion\nJustus Kriewald (2010 - 2012) — Keyboards/Backing Vocals/Bass\nUli Stornowski (2012–2013) — Percussion/Flute/Backing Vocals\n\n\n=== Live only ===\nMichael Metzler (2003–Present) — also a member of Sarband\nNeil Rupsch (2010-2011) — Drums\nRené Bielig (2010-2011) — Guitars/Bass\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

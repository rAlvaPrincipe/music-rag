    "text": "Dead Man's Bones were a rock duo consisting of Ryan Gosling and Zach Shields. Their first album, Dead Man's Bones, was released on October 6, 2009, through ANTI- records. The entire album is a collaboration with the Silverlake Conservatory Children's Choir — started by Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea — from Los Angeles, California. Gosling performs under the alias \"Baby Goose\".\n\n\n== Background and development ==\nWhen Shields and Gosling met in 2005 they discovered a mutual obsession with the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. Zach was so preoccupied with ghosts as a kid that he was put into therapy, and Gosling's parents moved out of his childhood home because they believed it was haunted. Neither of them had really outgrown their fascination with graveyards or anything deathly and decided to write love stories about ghosts and monsters.\nThe pair chose to play all the instruments on the record, even those they had never touched before. They also imposed rules on themselves during the recording process, such as not playing with a click track, and trying to do no more than three takes on any song, letting any imperfections highlight the strengths of the music. On December 25, 2008, Dead Man's Bones released a music video and free download for their song \"In the Room Where You Sleep\", and on April 4, 2009, the band released another music video for their song \"Name in Stone\" on MySpace and YouTube. The self-titled debut album from the band featured members of the Silverlake Conservatory of Music's children's choir and was released on October 6, 2009, through ANTI- and was produced by Tim Anderson of Ima Robot. Gosling and Shields also toured around the United States for fall/Halloween 2009 with a local choir and talent show at every show to rave reviews. Each children's choir was similar to Silverlake Conservatory Children's Choir with whom they recorded the album. In 2010, they released two other music videos for tracks: \"Dead Hearts\" and \"Pa Pa Power\".\nGosling's use of a children's choir was cited as inspiration for blackened death metal band Behemoth to do the same on their 2018 album I Loved You at Your Darkest. They have also been cited as an influence on Our Time Down Here.\nIn the closing credits of the 2013 French film, Age of Panic, the Dead Man's Bones song \"Lose Your Soul\" is featured. The song \"In the Room Where You Sleep\" was included in the soundtrack of the 2013 film, The Conjuring.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\"Intro\"\n\"Dead Hearts\"\n\"In the Room Where You Sleep\"\n\"Buried in Water\"\n\"My Body's a Zombie for You\"\n\"Pa Pa Power\"\n\"Young & Tragic\"\n\"Paper Ships\"\n\"Lose Your Soul\"\n\"Werewolf Heart\"\n\"Dead Man's Bones\"\n\"Flowers Grow out of My Grave\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nRyan Gosling – vocals, bass guitar, guitar, piano, keyboards\nZach Shields – vocals, drums, percussion, guitar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo Premiere: Dead Man's Bones' Haunting \"Dead Hearts\" – Rolling Stone\nDead Man's Bones performing \"Name In Stone\" at a cemetery with L.A.

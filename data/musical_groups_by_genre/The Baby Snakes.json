    "text": "The Baby Snakes were an Irish rock band formed in 1985. The original line-up featured Frank Rynne, Niall O'Sullivan and Johnny Bonney. In October 1985 they recorded a radio session for Dave Fanning's RTÉ radio show and reached No. 13 in Fanning's Fab 50, an end-of-year listeners poll, in December 1985. Their first L.P., Sweet Hunger, featured Brian Downey from  Thin Lizzy on drums. Their second L.P. was produced by Dave Goodman. In 1988, after a BBC Radio 1 session for Janice Long, the band moved to London with new drummer Stephen R Kennedy [now a hydro engineer in France] who previously played in a band headed by Noel Phelan (now a house DJ) where they played a mix of underground venues as well as The Marquee.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSong \"Johnny\" - Various Artists - Weird Weird World of Guru Weirdbrain LP - Hotwire Records - HWLP8505 - IRL - 1985\nSongs for Subliminal Kids EP 7\" - Santides Records - SAN 0057 - IRL – 1987\nThis City Sucks (live) - Cassette FOAD Records - ??? - January 1988\nSweet Hunger LP FOAD Records - FOAD 7 - June 1988 Produced by Ian Bryon and Paul Thomas.\nRebel Radio LP - Santides Records - SAN0089 - July 1990 Produced by Dave Goodman\nLooking for Strange (Cassette) - Santides, 1990\nFour Foot Tapping Greats EP 7\" - Santides Records - SUE 66 - UK - 1992 Four Johnny Cash covers, 2 recorded in mono.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Baby Snakes \"Fade\" on Anything Goes, RTE, 1984\nThe Baby Snakes \"Looking for Strange\" on Megamix, RTE, 1987\nProfile of The Baby Snakes'"

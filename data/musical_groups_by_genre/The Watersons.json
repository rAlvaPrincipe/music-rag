    "text": "The Watersons were an English folk group from Hull, Yorkshire. They performed mainly traditional songs with little or no accompaniment. Their distinctive sound came from their closely woven harmonies. They have been called the \"most famous family in English folk music\".\n\n\n== Style ==\nTheir style is a unique blend of originality and tradition. The Watersons never learned to read music. They began by singing hunting songs, hymns and carols with their grandmother, ones that she probably sang with her parents. One family member would sing the melody, and the rest would join in, choosing a harmony note if the melody was out of their range.\nTheir style can be compared to the Copper Family of Sussex, a dynasty of traditional singers who sing in harmony, which was extremely unusual in traditional English music.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe band's original members were Norma, Mike, and Elaine known as Lal Waterson, with their cousin John Harrison from Kingston High School. They had a skiffle band in the early 1960s but moved on to playing more traditional material. They were briefly known as \"the Folksons\".\nTheir first album was Frost and Fire 1965, followed by The Watersons and A Yorkshire Garland in 1966. The Watersons split up in 1968, when Norma went to work as a disc jockey on a radio station on Montserrat.\nThe group reformed in 1972, with John Harrison briefly replaced by Bernie Vickers. In that year they performed and arranged the music for the Alan Plater TV Play for Today, \"The Land of Green Ginger\", set and filmed in Hull, and appeared in a scene filmed in the Bluebell Folk Club.\nVickers was replaced the same year by Norma's husband, Martin Carthy. This line-up recorded For Pence and Spicy Ale (1975), Sound, Sound Your Instruments of Joy (1977), and Green Fields (1981).\nLater line-ups featured Mike Waterson's daughter Rachel Waterson, who briefly replaced Lal during a leave of absence caused by ill health in the mid-1980s, then continued to sing with the group on Lal's return. This five-piece line up performed regularly during the late 1980s and recorded a session for the BBC Andy Kershaw show in August 1986. In 1987, the group collaborated with Swan Arcade to form Blue Murder, who have performed and recorded sporadically with various line-ups to the present day. Subsequent Watersons line-ups fluctuated, featuring Eliza Carthy, Anne Waterson, Jill Pidd and Maria Gilhooley at various times, but recording only occasionally.\nLal Waterson died in 1998 and, by the early 1990s, Carthy, Norma Waterson and their daughter Eliza Carthy had formed the group Waterson–Carthy. The Watersons gradually ceased to sing live on a regular basis, but the family occasionally reconvened for special events and festival appearances, where they are usually billed as \"The Waterson Family\". These have included 'A Mighty River of Song' at the Royal Albert Hall on 12 May 2007, the BBC Electric Proms concert, 'Once in a Blue Moon: A Tribute to Lal Waterson', at Cecil Sharp House in London on 25 October 2007 and 'A Tribute to Bert,' a concert celebrating the life and work of Albert Lancaster Lloyd, at Cecil Sharp House on 15 November 2008. During the summer of 2009, \"The Waterson Family\" performed at a number of festivals and large concerts throughout England and Ireland.\nMike Waterson died on 22 June 2011, aged 70, at Scarborough, North Yorkshire\nNorma Waterson died on 30 January 2022, at the age of 82.\n\n\n== Commendations ==\nThe accompanying book to the Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set Three Score and Ten lists two of their albums as classic albums.  The first is Frost and Fire: 34  with Hal-an-Tow as the eleventh track on the second CD and the second is For Pence and Spicy Ale.: 46   The title track of the boxed set is taken from the various artists album New Voices and is the seventeenth track on the sixth CD.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nVarious Artists: New Voices: An Album of First Recordings by Harry Boardman, Maureen Craik, The Waterson Family (1965)\nThe five Watersons tracks included on this album later formed part of the Early Days CD (1994)\nThe Watersons: Frost and Fire: A Calendar of Ceremonial Folk Songs (1965)\nReissued on CD with additional tracks from Sound, Sound Your Instruments of Joy in 1990.

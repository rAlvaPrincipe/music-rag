    "text": "Star Wars: In Concert, previously referred to as Star Wars: A Musical Journey, is a series of concerts featuring a symphony orchestra and choir, along with footage from the Star Wars saga films displayed on a large LED screen at three stories tall. The screen is set to live performances of the Star Wars score composed by John Williams. The first performance took place in The O2 Arena in London, England and was attended by approximately 20,000 fans. The first North American tour started in Anaheim, California on October 1, 2009, and the second and most recent North American tour ended in London, Ontario on April 14, 2015. The concert series was scheduled to return sometime in 2016, but has since been delayed.\nThe concerts are narrated by Anthony Daniels, conducted by Dirk Brossé, and performed by the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra. James Earl Jones provides his voice for Daniels' introduction.  The concert uses selected compositions from the Star Wars saga starting with Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace and ending with Episode VI: Return of the Jedi with an intermission between the two trilogies. Although the musical selections are presented in order according to episode, the film clips do not correlate to the film the music is from, but correlate thematically.\n\n\n== Scenes ==\n\n\n=== Set one ===\nOpening: THX Deep Note, 20th Century Fox Fanfare, \"Main Title/Blockade Runner\"\nDark Forces Conspire: \"Duel of the Fates\"\nA Hero Rises: \"Anakin's Theme\"\nDroids!: \"The Dune Sea of Tatooine/Jawa Sandcrawler\"\nA Race With Destiny: \"The Flag Parade\"\nForbidden Love: \"Across the Stars\"\nA Hero Falls: \"Battle of the Heroes\"\nAn Empire is Forged: \"The Imperial March\"\n\n\n=== Intermission ===\nThe first set is followed by a twenty-minute intermission.

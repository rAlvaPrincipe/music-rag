    "text": "The Wonderful Grand Band is a Canadian music and comedy group formed in 1978 in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was founded in 1978, and included comedians Greg Malone and Tommy Sexton. They released their first album, The Wonderful Grand Band, in 1979.\nThe group had an eponymous television musical variety show on CBC Television. This ran for six episodes under the title The Root Seller in 1978, before relaunching in 1980 as The Wonderful Grand Band, which produced 40 more episodes between 1980 and 1983. The show starred Ron Hynes, Sandy Morris, Ian Perry, Glenn  Simmons (later replaced by Steve Annan, who died in 2010), Kelly Russell (later replaced by Jamie Snider), and Rocky Wiseman (who was later replaced by Paul Stamp), as well as Malone  and Sexton, who died in 1993. The show combined original and traditional music with topical comedy sketches and satire, some of which was directed at the CBC itself.\nThe band released a second album, Living in a Fog, in 1981.\nThe band reunited in 2009 for a series of concerts throughout Newfoundland and Labrador, in conjunction with the release of two DVDs containing 12 episodes of the TV show.  A second, one-off reunion was held in August 2012 at a Ron Hynes concert held before Hynes entered treatment for throat cancer.\nOn December 7, 2017, The Wonderful Grand Band released a re-recorded version of Babylon Mall for the 50th anniversary of the Avalon Mall, with Mark Critch from CBC's This Hour Has 22 Minutes on vocals.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent Members\n\nSandy Morris - acoustic & electric lead guitars, backing vocals                                            (1978 - 1983, 1997, 2009 - present)\nGreg Malone - comedian                                                             (1978, 1979 - 1983, 1997, 2009 - present)\nGlenn Simmons - lead vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, bass, backing vocals (1978 - 1982, 1997, 2009 - present)\nJamie Snider - lead vocals, fiddle, guitars, mandolin                                                      (1980 - 1983, 1997, 2009 - present)\nPaul \"Boomer\" Stamp - drums, percussion, backing vocals                                                  (1981 - 1982, 1982 - 1983, 1997, 2009–present)\nIan Perry - bass, guitars, backing vocals                                                                  (1978 - 1982, 1997, 2009 - present)\nPast Members\n\nBryan Hennessey - bass, harmonica                                                                          (1978) (died 2021)\nBawnie Oulton - backing vocals                                                                             (1978) (died 2010)\nKelly Russell - fiddle, mandolin, dulcimer, backing vocals                    (1978 - 1980)\nRocky Wiseman - drums                                                                                      (1978 - 1981) (died 2018)\nSteve Annan - guitars                                                                                      (1982 - 1983) (died 2010)\nHowie Warden - bass                                                                                        (1982 - 1983)\nKevin McNeil - drums                                                                                       (1982)\nRon Hynes – lead vocals, guitars, mandolin, banjo, backing vocals                                      (1978 - 1983, 1997, 2009 - 2015) (died 2015)\nTommy Sexton –  vocals, comedian                                                                       (1979 - 1983) (died 1993)\nCathy Jones - comedian                                                                                 (1982 - 1983)\nMary Walsh - comedian                                                             (1982 - 1983)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSee also List of songs by the Wonderful Grand Band.\n\nWonderful Grand Band (1978)\nLiving in a Fog (1981)\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\n\n== External links ==\nWonderful Grand Band Wonderful Grand Band official site"

    "text": "Forever the Sickest Kids (sometimes abbreviated as FTSK) is an American pop punk band from Dallas, Texas. The band first signed with Universal Motown Records and released its debut album, Underdog Alma Mater, on April 29, 2008. The band's second album, Forever the Sickest Kids, was released on March 1, 2011. Universal Motown Records was later shut down in 2011 and the band was left unsigned for over a year until signing to Fearless Records in late 2012. The band released its third studio album, J.A.C.K., on June 25, 2013. In an Alternative Press article, the band was placed number one of the \"22 Best Underground Bands\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2001–2006: Early projects and formation ===\nIn 2001–2004, the members of Forever the Sickest Kids were brought together from separate paths. From Burleson, Texas, Jonathan Cook and Kyle Burns were in a band together in high school, Good Day Josif. About the same time in Hurst, Texas, Marc Stewart and Kent Garrison were in a band together called Triumph Over Tragedy, with friends from their high school. In Rockwall, Texas, Turman and Bello were in an acoustic pop band, Committed.\nThe three bands all played local clubs around Dallas/Fort Worth, and on occasion, at the same events and concerts. Burns and Stewart are step-brothers, resulting in Good Day Josif and Triumph Over Tragedy sharing a practice space in their parents' garage.\nIn 2004, upon the break up of Good Day Josif and Triumph over Tragedy, Cook, Stewart and Burns formed the band the Flipside, along with their friend Chris Hill. Craig Calloway (from Triumph over Tragedy) was added to the Flipside's lineup, and Garrison replaced Chris Hill on bass guitar. The band went on to play at local shows and released an independent eponymous EP.\nAround the same time, Committed broke up, and childhood friends Austin Bello and Caleb Turman formed an acoustic/electronic project called Been Bradley. They never released any albums or EPs, but many of the band's songs were released online through the group's MySpace profile, such as \"All for Angela\" and \"X Me Out.\"\nWhen both bands, the Flipside and Been Bradley, ended in late 2006, Cook and Stewart came into contact with Bello and Turman, and it was suggested that the remaining members from both bands could form in a new band. Their new band, Forever the Sickest Kids, was formed. Cook remained on vocals, Turman took on rhythm guitar and vocals, Bello was on bass guitar and vocals, Stewart was on lead guitar, Burns was on drums, and Garrison switched to keyboard. Calloway (of the Flipside) did not take part in the band, but would later be a part of the band Artist vs. Poet as a guitarist.\n\n\n=== 2006–2009: Underdog Alma Mater ===\nDays after the formation of Forever the Sickest Kids, Cook accidentally spent $350 that the band did not have on PureVolume to receive a front-page placement of a song. The band also did not have any songs written yet. The band wrote the song \"Hey Brittany\" and recorded it in two days. The band landed a record deal with Universal Motown Records in April 2007 and released their first EP, Television Off, Party On on July 3, 2007. The EP was recorded within four months of the group's formation. Two more EPs, The Sickest Warped Tour EP and Hot Party Jamz followed, months afterward. After these releases, the group toured across America and appeared on that year's Warped Tour.\nOn March 18, 2008, the group released the song, \"Whoa Oh! (Me vs. Everyone)\" on their MySpace page.

The band covered the song, \"Men in Black\" by Will Smith for the compilation album Punk Goes Crunk.\nIn support of the album, the band went on the 2008 Alternative Press tour along with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches and Sonny. They went on a US tour alongside Metro Station, the Maine, the Cab and Danger Radio in May 2008. The band also performed on the 2008 Vans Warped Tour.

The band performed at the 2009 Vans Warped Tour in late June and late August.\n\n\n=== 2009–2011: The Weekend: Friday and self-titled album ===\nOn October 30, 2009, the band released a new single, \"What Do You Want from Me\". The song serves as the lead single from their fourth EP The Weekend: Friday, which was released on November 17, 2009. On November 12, the EP was made available for streaming on the band's MySpace profile. The EP was originally intended to be a mini-LP, and was to be the first part of The Weekend series, with Saturday and Sunday slated for 2010. The EP debuted at number 107 on the US Billboard 200. A music video for \"What Do You Want from Me\" premiered on December 14, 2009 via MTV.\nOn January 25, 2010, the band was featured on an episode of the MTV series Silent Library.

The band went on \"The Summer Camp for the Dope Awesome Kids Tour\", which featured The Scene Aesthetic, The Ready Set, A Cursive Memory and Phone Calls from Home.\n\nThe group began working on their second studio album with producers David Bendeth and John Bender in 2010 in New Jersey, New York, Irving and Fort Worth. The band ultimately merged The Weekend: Saturday into their second album. They explained this decision was made because as they had gone into the studio with producer Bendeth, they continued to quickly write more than five songs for the EP and decided to release a full-length album instead. While touring, the band began to play a new track from the new album, called \"Life of the Party\".\nOn January 10, 2011, two months before the release of the self-titled album, Garrison posted on his blog that he was leaving the band, stating that he wanted to \"pursue other opportunities.\" The group released their self-titled album, Forever the Sickest Kids for streaming on their MySpace page on February 27, 2011.

Rico Andradi served as a touring member for the band and became Stewart's replacement. The band later commented on both Garrison's and Stewart's departures, stating that both had left on great terms and wanted to go back to college, due to never finishing because of the formation of the band.\nDue to the separation of Motown Records from Universal Motown Records and Universal Motown Republic Group and because of the cancellations with Universal Motown, the band was left unsigned.

Their performance marked the first time they had played together since late 2013.\nIn an interview, Cook revealed the band has no plans to release new music or to hold any performances in the near future.

Many of the band's songs feature synthesizers and have dance and electronic based influences, along with the piano and keyboard often being included. Acoustic and hip hop have also been utilized in the group's music. The band mainly has positive, upbeat sounds in its songs, which are typically structured with pop based hooks, both electronic and regular drum beats, and catchy guitar riffs that still maintain rock and punk elements to the music. A primary example that displays the band's structure, sound, and vocal arrangement is the song \"I Don't Know About You, But I Came to Dance\", found on the band's first release, Television Off, Party On.\nBefore his departure, Stewart stated, \"Ultimately, when you hear the music, we want it to make you want to dance in your car while you're driving. We want it to be easy to sing along to but so catchy you don't wanna stop.\"\nIn nearly every song by the band, Cook, Bello, and Turman share lead vocals. Cook usually sings the chorus of the song, while Bello and Turman take on the verses, although it is not limited to this routine. Cook generally sings with a powerful, screeching voice and frequently ranges from a low to high pitch. Bello's vocals are similar to Cook's; however, Bello usually sings with a higher pitch and has a more distinct voice. Turman is known for taking the lead in the band's acoustic songs, such as \"Coffee Break\" and \"Forever Girl\", due to having a much softer voice than Cook and Bello. He also sang prominently in \"What Happened to Emotion? (Killing Me)\", with Cook and Bello only singing the bridge of the song.\nBlink-182, Fall Out Boy, Weezer, Bowling for Soup, New Found Glory, and Fountains of Wayne have served as some of the main influences for the band.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\nUnderdog Alma Mater (2008)\nForever the Sickest Kids (2011)\nJ.A.C.K.

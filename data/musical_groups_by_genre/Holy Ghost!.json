    "text": "Holy Ghost! were an American synthpop duo from Brooklyn, New York City. Founded in 2007, the duo consisted of Nick Millhiser and Alex Frankel.\n\n\n== History ==\nMillhiser and Frankel both grew up on the Upper West Side of New York City and attended Trevor Day School together. They were later part of a hip hop group called Automato. Automato's debut album was produced by James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy of DFA. According to Frankel, after the release of the album, Automato \"kind of fell apart\". Millhiser and Frankel kept working on music, their collaboration having already begun moving towards the alternative dance genre.\nThe name Holy Ghost! was selected just before the pressing of their debut single \"Hold On\" in November 2007. The single was described by Resident Advisor as \"one of the dirtiest little Italo tunes you're likely to hear this year\".\nThe duo continued to work on various remixes for the likes of Moby, Cut Copy and MGMT. Their second single, \"I Will Come Back\" was initially released in conjunction with Mountain Dew's Green Label Sound record label. A video was made for the single that is a shot-for-shot remake of New Order's \"Confusion\" video, including Arthur Baker reprising his role from the original. The song was later included on the Static on the Wire EP, released on the 18 May 2010. The duo also began to play live, starting with a tour with label mates LCD Soundsystem.\nThe duo's self-titled debut album was released on April 2, 2011. Their second album, Dynamics, was released on September 3, 2013. The duo's second extended play, Crime Cutz, was released on April 29, 2016. Their third album, Work, was released on June 21, 2019.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nHoly Ghost!

    "text": "The Down Hill Strugglers, previously known as the Dust Busters, is an American old-time string band trio from Brooklyn, New York. Formed in 2008, the band has been influenced by the music of rural America, including Appalachian traditions, music from the Deep South, and the Western States. The band was originally made up of Craig Judelman, Eli Smith, and Walker Shepard. In 2012, Craig Judelman left the Dust Busters and was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Jackson Lynch. At the same time, the band changed its name to the Down Hill Strugglers.\n\n\n== About ==\nEli Smith and Walker Shepard met while at the home of Peter Stampfel of The Holy Modal Rounders, where they also met John Cohen of The New Lost City Ramblers.

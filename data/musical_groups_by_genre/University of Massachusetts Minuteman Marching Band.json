    "text": "The University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band (UMMB) is the marching band for the University of Massachusetts Amherst known for its drum corps style and nationally renowned percussion section. The Minuteman Band is also known for its use of dance routines, vocalists, electronics, and overall showmanship.\nThe Minuteman Band plays halftime and post-game shows at all home football games and a variety of away games, parades, and exhibitions each season. The band has performed internationally in Canada and Ireland, at Ronald Reagan's and George W. Bush's inaugurations, the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade, and the Rose Parade. The Minuteman Band has also given five exhibition performances at the annual Bands of America Grand National Championships and performed at 15 pro football games. The band has performed at the annual Collegiate Marching Band Festival in Allentown, Pennsylvania since the festival's inception in 1995 to 2019.\nThe UMass Band ethos was captured in the 1994 documentary \"Building Power and Class\", broadcast on PBS affiliates in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.  In 1998, the Minuteman Marching Band was awarded the prestigious Sudler Trophy, the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a collegiate marching band. In 2003, band alumna and former drum major Kerstin Becker published \"Through These Doors,\" a coffee-table size book chronicling the history of the Minuteman Band.\nThe band was directed by George N. Parks from 1977 until his sudden death in September 2010; prompting Assistant Director Thom Hannum to be named interim director, assisted by Michael Klesch. Timothy Todd Anderson was named director of the band in 2011.\nIn 2011, the George N. Parks Minuteman Marching Band Building was completed, giving the band its first home since the Old Chapel was closed in 1997.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe band program at University of Massachusetts Amherst started in 1873 when the University was known as the Massachusetts Agricultural College.  The Morris Drum Corps, as it was known, was the first resemblance of a marching band at the school, and it was directed by First Lieutenant Charles Morris of the 5th Army Artillery.\nIn the 1890s, the band was renamed the Clark Memorial Cadet Band after former college president William S. Clark.  At the close of the century the band's instrumentation expanded, but the musicians consisted only of military cadets.\nIn 1931, the Massachusetts Agricultural College, or \"Aggie\", became the Massachusetts State College.  Soon after, in 1934, the College hired its first music instructor, Frank Stratton.  A year later, Massachusetts Agricultural College started to organize a formal band program, and appointed its first non-military band instructor, Charles Farnum.  The newly created band became known as the \"Redmen Marching Band\". In 1938, the band had its most successful season to date by playing at all home games and an away game versus the United States Coast Guard Academy.  During World War II, all bands at the University were disbanded from March 1943 until September 1945 because many of the members served in the military.\nAfter the war, the band remained small, so the director set out to create a female \"drill team\" to augment the band.  In 1946, this team expanded to a size of 44.  This drill team was given the name of the \"Precisionettes\" in 1952.\nIn 1947 the Massachusetts State College became the University of Massachusetts. The band's name changed from the Redmen Marching Band to the Minuteman Marching Band in the 1970s under the leadership of Professor John Jenkins. Jenkins brought a new style of marching, high step rapid rhythm (thighs parallel to the ground) to UMass from the University of Michigan, and composer Jerry Bilik, who notably wrote the \"Fight Mass\" fight song. In 1977, George N. Parks was hired to direct the band. Parks brought the roll-step marching style and fostered the reputation that the band has today. His unique styles and intensity were widely praised.\nUntil 1997, the band was housed in Old Chapel on campus. From then, and until the October 17, 2009 groundbreaking of a marching band specific building, the band utilized a variety of campus locations for space. The University named the building in honor of George Parks.\nIn 2010, George Parks suffered a heart attack while traveling with the band to the University of Michigan. Associate director Thom Hannum was named interim director. In 2011, Timothy Todd Anderson was named permanent Director and Professor Hannum resumed his role as Associate Director. Christine McHugh Sirard was named Assistant Director in 2015, and serves as director of the color guard.\nIn May 2021, it was announced that UMass alumnus Ian Hale will be replacing Thom Hannum as Associate Director and head of percussion beginning August 2, 2021.\n\n\n=== Minuteman Band Hall of Fame ===\nMany former band members and other figures have been elected to the Minuteman Band Hall of Fame by its alumni association since 1993.  Induction years listed in parentheses.\n\n\n== Leadership and Sections ==\n\n\n=== Directors ===\n\nCharles Morris (1861-???)\nCharles Farnum (1935–1945)\nDoric Alviani (1945–1949)\nEzra Schabas (1949–1950)\nJoseph Contino (1950–1963)\nJohn Jenkins (1963–1977)\nLarry V. Weed (1970–1971)\nGeorge N. Parks (1977–2010)\nThom Hannum (interim director 2010–2011)\nTimothy Todd Anderson (2011–present)\n\n\n=== Student Staff ===\nStudent leadership has a major role in the UMMB. The UMMB is composed of student run administrative staff as well as field staff. Students in these roles are responsible for many aspects of the band on and off the field.\n\n\n==== Drum Majors ====\nAs of the 2024 season, the current Drum majors are Brayden Hackett, Rebekah Doucette, Qeanu Smith, Marielle Chrupcala, and Nicole Ramirez. \n\n\n==== Executive Staff / Ad Staff ====\nStudents can take on leadership roles within the band such as band manager, travel manager, and personnel manager. There is also administrative staff roles which include web staff, AV staff, merchandise staff, uniform staff, PR staff, historian staff, equipment staff, and library staff.\n\n\n=== Instrumentation ===\nThe Minuteman Band consists of typical marching band instruments: piccolos, flutes, clarinets, alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones, trumpets, mellophones, trombones, marching baritone horns, and sousaphones. \nIn addition to the instrumentation on the field, the band has a front ensemble, small-group horn section, as well as various singers. The wind and guard sections of the band do not require auditions for their members, however some instruments like the piccolo, guitar, bass, and vocals require an audition which is open to any band member. The twirlers, drum line and front ensemble are auditioned.\n\n\n=== Style ===\nThe Minuteman Band's style is that of a drum corps, forming precise drill sets and shapes. However, The UMMB is known for its \"dance-like moves\" and tends to mix them in with the more traditional marching styles. The main show theme usually includes traditional marching band styles with some songs that are looser and less rigid. The band's use of amplification with electric guitars and other percussion often gives the band the reputation as a non-traditional marching band.\n\n\n=== Colorguard and Twirlers ===\n\nThe UMass Colorguard and Twirlers are the visual sections in the University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band, the Power and Class of New England. The Colorguard is led by Chris McHugh Sirard and is a fully modernized ensemble utilizing flag, rifle, sabre, dance, and alternative equipment.\nThe UMass colorguard began in 1974 and has been performing alongside the UMMB ever since. The UMMB and Colorguard perform at halftime and during post-game at all home football games and frequently travels to away games. The band has also performed at Bands of America in 1993, 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2011. As of the 2019 season, there were over 40 members in the UMass colorguard.\nThe twirlers are led by Kristi Ochs. They incorporate baton, dance, and ribbon into their routines.\n\n\n=== Percussion ===\n\nThe Minuteman Marching Band's percussion section is widely considered to be one of the best in the nation. The UMass Drumline has helped to build a national reputation for their dedication, skill, and hard work that is paralleled by few others in the nation. The percussion section was most notably instructed by DCI hall-of-famer Thom Hannum until 2021 when Ian Hale was named the new head of percussion. Hannum is best known for his work in Drum Corps International, as well as being a clinician and author of percussive technique books.\nThe UMass Drumline is also known for many of its alumni who have branched out into many teaching and writing opportunities in percussive arts throughout the nation. This includes Hale who has worked with Madison Scouts, Carolina Crown, Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps, and Boston Crusaders Drum and Bugle Corps prior to his role as head of percussion and associate director.\n\n\n=== Band Culture ===\nEach instrument section of the band takes on its own unique identity, featuring Greek letters, various traditions, and section attire that help create community within the band.\nFlutes/Piccolos: The Flute section's Greek letters are BΣΛ. The flutes are known for their \"Sparkle Hut\" and wear red ribbons in their hair on gamedays and other performances.\nClarinets: The Clarinet section (also known as Netline Bestline) has the Greek letters ΛBΣ. The clarinets wear purple bandanas on gamedays and other performances.\nAlto Saxophones: The alto saxophone section (heard when chanting \"Fish, Fish, Fish!\") has the Greek letters ΣΑΧ. The altos wear red bandanas on gamedays and other performances.\nTenor Saxophones: The tenor saxophone section has the Greek letters ΣΔΜ. Tenors wear black bandanas on gamedays and other performances.\nBaritone Saxophones: The baritone saxophone section has the Greek letters ΒΦΣ. The \"baris\" wear blue bandanas on gamedays and other performances.\nTrumpets: The trumpet section (also known as the Hogline) does not have Greek letters, but instead has the quasi-Latin phrase \"Hogo Ergo Sum\", a play on Descartes' cogito, ergo sum. The trumpets (members are called Hogs) wear thin red elastic bands on gamedays and other performances.\nMellophones: The 'mellos' are known for promoting \"tuning time\" as \"Confidence O'Clock\". The mellos wear yellow bandanas on gamedays and other performances.\nTrombones: The trombone section (also called the Bones) has a combination of Greek letters and symbols, Δ#$. The trombones wear green bucket hats on gamedays and other performances.\nMarching Baritones: The marching baritone section has the Greek letters EΥΦ and calls itself \"the Euphs\" (named after the euphonium) and has the proper name \"EuphMass\" (taken once again from euphonium and combined with the similar-sounding \"UMass\"). The euphs wear camouflage bandanas on gamedays and other performances.\nSousaphones: The sousaphones, who call themselves the Tubas or T-SUBs, do not have Greek letters; Their symbol is called the \"Super-T\" and is similar to Superman's logo replaced with a T. The sousaphones wear sunglasses on gamedays and other performances.\nPercussion: The drumline and front ensemble host the Greek letters ΦΒΔ. In rehearsals and some performances, snares wear Philadelphia Phillies hats, tenor drums wear Atlanta Braves hats, basses wear Boston Red Sox hats, and cymbals wear \"Life is Good\" hats. The members of the percussion section also have sweatshirts and shirts emblazoned with their Greek letters.\nThe band also hosts many different traditions at games, performances, and during/after rehearsals. Events such as Trombone Friday, Banana Wednesday, and section dinners bring band spirit and morale up. As the band marches during the drumline cadence, each section creates \"shenanigans\" that they will perform during the cadence. These are often small sayings and phrases that are included alongside the cadence that often have very little or no meaning and bring life and energy to the cadence, for the band members and audience alike.\nVarious \"relationships\" emerge between sections, where two sections will \"get married\". For example, at the band's 2023 trip to MICCA, the Flutes and Tubas held a wedding ceremony in between performances that was attended by a small but supportive crowd.\nFurthermore, there are also section \"divorces\", such as the historic Tenor-Euph divorce in 2021.\n\n\n== Recent Seasons ==\n\n\n=== 2003-2007 ===\nThe 2003 Season show consisted of a mix of songs with no clearly set theme. It has sometimes been called \"Hot Jazz\". Among the songs were \"Birdland\", \"El Boro\", \"Legend of the One Eyed Sailor\", \"Get it On\", and Gloria Estefan's \"Oye Tu Conga\". The pit was featured on a version of Radiohead's \"Paranoid Android\".

The band played for the high schoolers as a \"thank you\" for being allowed to use their facilities during a stopover on the Michigan trip. The band decided to go ahead to Michigan, and performed to great success in front of 110,187 people, the largest audience in the band's history. When the band returned to Cuyahoga Falls on their way home, the town provided a banquet when the band arrived, and a police escort when they departed the next day.\nTwo weeks after Michigan, the band performed in Allentown.

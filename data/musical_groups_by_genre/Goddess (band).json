(with Ingrid \"B.B. Queen\" Simons) and Club Risqu√© (with Daryl White). Goddess released The Sexual Album in 1992, and while it did not chart, the single \"Sexual\" peaked at #74 on the Billboard Hot 100, staying on the charts for ten weeks. They released a few more singles afterwards, without the same success.\nValentine died from cancer in 2002. The Bolland brothers, who had produced a number of electronic music records since the early 1970s, have been inactive since the end of the 1990s.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Sexual Album (1992)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1992\n\nSexual\nIn My Bed\nJe T'Aime\n1993\n\nGet Loud (Racism Beat It)\n1994\n\nSpirits in the Night\nTapdancer (I Wanna See You Mooove)\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Isle of Failed Pop Stars: Goddess - The Sexual Album (1992)\nThe Eurodance Encyclopaedia: Goddess\nDiscogs: Goddess\nRare and Obscure Music: Goddess"

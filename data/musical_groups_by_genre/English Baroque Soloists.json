    "text": "The English Baroque Soloists is a chamber orchestra playing on period instruments, formed in 1978 by English conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner. Its repertoire comprises music from the early Baroque to the Classical period.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe English Baroque Soloists developed from the Monteverdi Orchestra, which was formed by John Eliot Gardiner in 1968. The Monteverdi Orchestra played on modern instruments, and accompanied Gardiner's Monteverdi Choir.  In the late 1970s the orchestra transitioned to period instruments and became the English Baroque Soloists. The first concert under the new name was in 1977 at the Innsbruck Festival of Early Music, although the orchestra was not officially formed until 1978.\nThe orchestra played at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla in Westminster Abbey in 2023.\n\n\n== Relationship with other ensembles directed by Gardiner ==\nThe English Baroque Soloists often appear with John Eliot Gardiner's choir, the Monteverdi Choir.\nIn 1990 Gardiner formed the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, another period instrument ensemble.  The Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique specialises in a later repertoire than that of the English Baroque Soloists, but shares some players.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nThe orchestra has recorded under:\n\nArchiv Produktion\nErato Records\nPhilips Classics Records\nSoli Deo Gloria, a label founded by John Eliot Gardiner in 2004, which originally released recordings made during the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, but has since broadened its catalogue.\n\n\n=== Discography ===\nSee Monteverdi Choir's discography section.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJohn Eliot Gardiner\nMonteverdi Choir\nOrchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEnglish Baroque Soloists - official website\nBach Cantata Pilgrimage"

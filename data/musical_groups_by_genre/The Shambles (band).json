    "text": "The Shambles is an American power pop and rock group from San Diego, California.\nFormed in 1990 from members of other regional bands, The Shambles have released numerous CDs, LPs and 7-inch singles, have toured extensively in the United States, and performed in the UK (including an appearance at the Marquee Club in London), Mexico, and Spain.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe founding members of The Shambles were guitarist Kevin Donaker-Ring (formerly of Manual Scan), Brad Wilkins formerly of Manual Scan (who came up with the name of the band), Ray Brandes and David Klowden (both formerly of The Tell-Tale Hearts), and bassist Mark Zadarnowski (formerly of The Crawdaddys). Guitarist/singer Bart Mendoza (also from Manual Scan) joined the group a few months later, and when Brandes departed soon after their 1991 U.K. tour, another former Tell Tale Heart, keyboardist Bill Calhoun also joined the group. Klowden departed shortly thereafter followed a year later by Calhoun. Zadarnowski parted ways with the band in 2005, leaving the core of Donaker-Ring and Mendoza.\nFollowing a brief stint from bassist David Lizerbram (formerly of Kite Flying Society), Florida native Kenny Howes (who has performed with Pat DiNizio and is fill in bassist with The Smithereens) joined the group in 2005, alternating between bass guitar and 12-string Rickenbacker, playing his last show with the band on May 1, 2010, before relocating to Dallas, Texas. Since Klowden's departure the groups drum duties have been filled by numerous drummers, including Mike Kamoo (The Stereotypes), Victor Penalosa (The Flamin' Groovies), Joel Valder (Sparkle*Jets U.K.), Todd Woolsey (Static Halo), John Chilson (The Loons) and Ron Silva (The Crawdaddys). The changeover in drummers is something of a running joke amongst the band, who issue an \"I Was a Shambles drummer\" pin to players.\n\n\n== Current activities ==\nIn 2015, the band released a 7-inch 4-track vinyl EP, Radio Daze, on Bickerton Records in Spain, composed of live radio sessions recorded for DJ Tim Pyles and the 91X program, Loudspeaker. In 2016, Spanish television network RTVE included footage of the Shambles in a music documentary series, Cachitos de Hierro y Cromo – in an episode called, YEAH, YEAH!\n\n\n== Partial discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nClouds All Day (U.S./Blindspot 10, 1996) also issued by: Spain / Snap Records\nReviving Spark (Japan/1+2 087, 1996)\nWhat You're Missing (Spain/Snap, 2000) two pressings with different booklets, blue or brown\nChelsea Smiles and More (Spain/Snap, 2001)\n20 Explosive Hits (U.S./Black Cherry Music Group, 2008)\nDesde Ayer (U.S./JAM-Blindspot, 2008)\nLive at the Casbah (U.S./Archive Records, 2013)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nOriginal Tangent (US/Gouramie 105,1995) PS EP Blue Vinyl\n(We've Got A) Groovy Thing (UK/Detour 031,1995) PS 7 EP on Black or Yellow Vinyl\nChelsea Smiles (US/Genuine Article GA-1,1998) 10-inch EP Blue Vinyl\nIt Might Rain Tonight (Spain/Snap, 2003)PS 7-inch EP\nRadio Daze – The Pyles Sessions (Spain/Bickerton, 2015)PS 7-inch EP\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nShe's Used To Playing With) Fire / Louise (Susstones 537/PS 45, 1993) also released in the U.S. by Prospective Records\nNadie Te Quiere Ya (US/Get Hip 195/PS 45, 1997)\n\n\n=== Soundtracks ===\nOST: A Box Full of Rocks – The El Cajon Years of Lester Bangs (U.S. / Road Ahead, 2014) – It Is and It Isn't (as Jon Kanis & The Shambles)\n\n\n=== Covers ===\nForty One Sixty: The Songs of the Shambles (US / JAM-Blindspot 109, 2009) – collects covers of the band's songs including The Lola's, Herb Eimerman, The Happy Losers and Cockeyed Ghost.\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nStaring At The Sun Volume 1 (US / Blindspot 001, 1992) -

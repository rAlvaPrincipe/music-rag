    "text": "I Am Spoonbender is an American/Canadian multimedia group formed in San Francisco in early 1997 by composer/multi-instrumentalist/producer Dustin Donaldson, with Brian Jackson and cub guitarist Robynn Iwata (a.k.a. 'Cup', who joined halfway through the recording of the debut album Sender/Receiver, after abandoning the guitar for synthesizers).\nTheir musical style has been favorably compared to Brian Eno, Can, and This Heat, and touches on elements of neo-psychedelia, ambient music, electronic music, tape music, psychedelic folk, synthpop, post-rock, post-punk, progressive, math rock, jazz, noise, pop, and musique concrete, with a distinctly experimental/avant-garde bent. Their sound has evolved over time and remains distinctive, making it difficult to place the group into a concise style or genre. Dustin Donaldson has noted that most of their influences are outside of music itself, although he has mentioned being inspired conceptually by Morton Subotnick, Wire, Laurie Anderson and Devo.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nDustin Donaldson: synths, drums, vocals, production 1997-\n\"Cup\" (Robynn Iwata): synths, vocals 1997-\n\n\n=== Current live members ===\nKevin Farkas – 2nd drumset, synths\nNolan Cook – bass and synths (The Residents, Dimesland)\nDrew Cook – bass and synths (Dimesland)\nMA'AT – perception management and subliminatexture\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nBrian Jackson: bass, synths, 1997–2000\nMarc Kate: synths, 1998–2003\n\n\n=== Past session members ===\nDave Edwardson (Neurosis): bass on Shown Actual Size, Buy Hidden Persuaders\n\n\n=== Past live members ===\nChad Amory: bass, synths, 2000–2001\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Live appearances ==\nLive appearances are rare.

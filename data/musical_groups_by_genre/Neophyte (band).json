    "text": "Neophyte is a Dutch hardcore, or gabber, group formed in 1992 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The three original members are Jeroen Streunding (DJ Neophyte, The Beholder for hardstyle releases), Danny Greten and Robin van Roon.\n\n\n== History ==\nJeroen Streunding was a DJ and organised smaller parties around 1990 before he met Danny Greten at a local party, when they decided to work on some tracks together. Robin van Roon also joined them after a while. Both Greten and van Roon were best friends, and classmates of Jeroens' younger sister. Having produced some tracks on an old Amiga Computer with Protracker, the three went to visit DJ Paul Elstak, who had just started his label Rotterdam Records where they hoped to be contracted. However, Elstak considered their tracks to be 'pure noise'. Several months and several try-outs later, Elstak suddenly liked their tracks and decided to release them on his label. As the years went by, Greten, Streunding and van Roon had more releases, and started performing on parties. In 1995, Robin van Roon left the group for his studies and Jarno Butter, a guitarist and good friend of Danny, was added for their live acts.\nIn 2005, Neophyte released a compilation album dedicated to their 13 years of existence titled 13 Jaar Terreur (English: 13 Years of Terror). It also contains tracks of the group released under different names such as \"Bodylotion\". Neophyte is also running a record label called Neophyte Records, currently hosting artists such as Tha Playah, DJ Panic and Evil Activities.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Three Amiga E.P.

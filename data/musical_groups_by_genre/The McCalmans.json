    "text": "The McCalmans (originally The Ian MacCalman Folk Group) were a Scottish folk trio. Formed on 6 October 1964, they recorded and toured without interruption until they disbanded in December 2010. Their performance was based on three part harmony, humour and a deep love and respect for the folk tradition in Scotland. They performed all over Europe, and in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Bermuda, Kenya, Cyprus, Belize and the Falkland Islands. They had six television series and BBC Network Radio series and appearances.\nThe original trio was formed by Ian McCalman (born 1 September 1946, in Edinburgh) on his first day at Edinburgh College of Art, where he, Derek Moffat (born near Dundee) and Hamish Bayne (born in Nairobi, Kenya) were studying architecture. Bayne left the band in 1982 and was replaced by Nick Keir. Moffat  died as a result of cancer in 2001, and was replaced by long-term friend of the band, Stephen Quigg. The group disbanded in 2010, when McCalman decided to retire from touring. He now runs a recording studio. Keir and Quigg continued to tour together until Keir's death in 2013.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAll In One Mind (as The Ian MacCalman Folk Group; 1968)\nSingers Three (1969)\nTurn Again (1970)\nNo Strings Attached (1971)\nAn Audience With The McCalmans (1973)\nSmuggler (1975)\nHouse Full (1976)\nSide By Side By Side (1977)\nBurn The Witch (1978)\nThe Best of (1979)\nThe Ettrick Shepherd (1980)\nAt Your Service (1980)\nBonnie Bands Again (1982)\nAncestral Manoeuvres (1984)\nScottish Songs (1986)\nPeace and Plenty (1986)\nListen To The Heat (1988)\nFlames on The Water (1990)\nSongs From Scotland (1991)\nHonest Poverty (1993)\nIn Harmony (1994)\nFestival Lights (1995)\nHigh Ground (1997)\nKeepers (1999)\nHard Night's Day (2000)\nWhere The Sky Meets The Sea (2002)\nTangled Web (2004)\nScots Abroad (2006)\nComing Home (2009)\nThe Greentrax Years (2010)\nLost Tracks (2016)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe McCalmans website\nBBC album review\nfolkmusic.net\nThe McCalmans; Mainly Norfolk"

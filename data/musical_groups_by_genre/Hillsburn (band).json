    "text": "Hillsburn was an indie pop band from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. During their career they were hailed by several media outlets as one of the east coast of Canada's next big acts. Hillsburn have released three full-length studio albums, and have won or been nominated for a number of regional and national awards.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\nThe band was formed as a quartet in 2014 at the home of band member Paul Aarntzen, who was residing in the small village of Hillsburn, Nova Scotia at the time. Rosanna Burrill and her brother Clayton were joined by Jackson Fairfax-Perry at Paul's home where the band had its first rehearsals. Aarntzen subsequently relocated to Halifax to dedicate more time to the project. Hillsburn released its self-titled, self-recorded EP in October 2014. One of the tracks from this self-recorded EP placed in the national top ten in CBC's Searchlight competition that year.\nThis success was followed up with the release of the band's first full-length album, In The Battle Years in 2016. Shortly after releasing their debut full-length the band added drummer Clare Macdonald to the mix. It's statements like this that make it extremely obvious that this entire article was written by the band themselves.  Clare, Rosanna, and Jackson had all previously known each other from Dalhousie University's Music program.\nIn The Battle Years was awarded the 2016 Canadian Folk Music Award for New/Emerging Artist of the Year. Hillsburn was also nominated in several categories at the 2017 East Coast Music Awards, including Rising Star Recording of the Year, Group Recording of the Year, and Fans' Choice Video of the Year. The band won the 2017 ECMA for Fans' Choice Video.\nHillsburn has toured extensively across North America.\nHillsburn released its sophomore record, The Wilder Beyond, on February 2, 2018. The album was nominated for six awards at the 2018 Nova Scotia Music Awards—including Group Recording of the Year, Recording of the Year, and Pop Recording of the Year—while Aarntzen was nominated for SOCAN songwriter of the year. Hillsburn also received four nominations for the 2019 East Coast Music Awards, including Group Recording of the Year and Fans' Choice Entertainer of the Year. The Wilder Beyond has charted extensively on the Earshot national campus and community radio charts in Canada. A deluxe edition of the album was released in February 2019.\nThe band announced in January 2020 that it was working on a new album with producer Howard Redekopp.\nPaul Aarntzen left Hillsburn in 2020 after the band finished work on its third album, Slipping Away. Released on May 28, 2021. Slipping Away was produced by Howard Redekopp, who has worked with other notable Canadian acts including Tegan and Sara, The New Pornographers, and Mother Mother.\nHillsburn released a first single from Slipping Away, 'Waking Up,' in October 2020. 'Husha' and 'Get High' followed in February and March 2021.\nThe band and Slipping Away led the field of nominees at the 2022 East Coast Music Awards, with a total of six nominations, including for Album of the Year. Paul Aarntzen was nominated for both Songwriter and Song of the Year for his work on the album.\nHillsburn announced it was disbanding in early 2024. Backed by Symphony Nova Scotia, the band played its final show on April 26, 2024, in front of a sold-out crowd at the Rebecca Cohn Auditorium at Dalhousie University.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nRosanna Burrill – vocals, bass, guitar, violin\nClayton Burrill – vocals, guitar, synthesizers\nJackson Fairfax-Perry – keyboards, synthesizers\nClare Macdonald – drums, percussion, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHillsburn EP – 2015\nIn the Battle Years – 2016\nThe Wilder Beyond – 2018\nThe Wilder Beyond (Deluxe Edition) – 2019\nSlipping Away – 2021\nStories – 2023\n\n\n== Documentary ==\nHillsburn: A Band Becomes (2016)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

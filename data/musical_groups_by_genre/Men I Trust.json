    "text": "Men I Trust is a Canadian indie band formed in Quebec City, Quebec, in 2014. The band consists of Emmanuelle Proulx (lead vocals, guitar), Jessy Caron (guitar, bass), and Dragos Chiriac (keyboards). The group has self-released all of their music and has released physical editions on the Canadian indie label Return to Analog. Men I Trust has independently released four studio albums: Men I Trust (2014), Headroom (2015), Oncle Jazz (2019) and Untourable Album (2021). They have also released two physical-only extended plays (EPs), Men I Trust (2017) and Tailwhip (2018).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2014–2017: Men I Trust, Headroom, and physical EPs ===\nMen I Trust was founded in 2014 by high school friends Jessy Caron and Dragos Chiriac, who reunited in the music department at Université Laval. They released a self-titled album in 2014; the band later performed at the Montreal Jazz Festival, Quebec City Summer Festival, and M for Montreal. \nThey released their second studio album Headroom in 2015. The album featured multiple vocalists, including Ghostly Kisses and Emmanuelle Proulx, who joined the group full-time as lead vocalist and guitarist in March 2016. Vocalist Odile Marmet-Rochefort also joined around this time. \nOn March 3, 2016, Men I Trust released the song \"Humming Man\", followed by the song \"Lauren\" June 13. In October and November 2016, the band embarked on a China tour, playing shows in Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai. After the tour, Marmet-Rochefort left the band to be a full-time member of her band De La Reine. On December 16, 2016, the band released the single \"Plain View\", alongside a music video made up of clips from their 2016 China Tour.\n\n\n=== 2017–2021: Oncle Jazz and Forever Live Sessions ===\nOn May 10, 2017, Men I Trust released the single \"You Deserve This\" alongside a music video filmed in Bucharest, Romania.

The album had initially been scheduled to release in February 2019, but was delayed multiple times due to the band's touring schedule and so they could ensure that it was ready. Eight of the twelve singles released since their previous album were reworked and included on this album. \nIn a conversation with writer Nick Fulton for Billboard, the band noted that the green, solitary confines of rural Quebec were influential in shaping how the album sounded. Proulx stated \"It put us in a really different creative mood and we were able to focus more, because there's nothing to do outside of the house except for walking and thinking about music.\" Oncle Jazz was long listed for the 2020 Polaris Music Prize.\nIn 2020, Men I Trust released the first live album Forever Live Sessions featuring songs from Oncle Jazz and other work. On June 16, 2021, they were featured in an episode of the NPR web series Tiny Desk (Home) Concert recorded in Quebec.\n\n\n=== 2021–present: Untourable Album ===\nThe band announced their fourth studio album Untourable Album on June 23, 2021, and it was released on August 25, 2021. It was supported by the Untourable Tour in North America which ran from September to November 2021. This was followed by the Untourable Euro Tour from May to October 2022, then an additional USA tour supported by Homeshake and Feng Suave from November to December 2022. \nOn June 29, 2022, Men I Trust released the song \"Hard to Let Go\", the first single since the release of their previous studio album. This was followed by the release of the single and video for \"Billie Toppy\" on September 28, and the single \"Girl\" on October 12.

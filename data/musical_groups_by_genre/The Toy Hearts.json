    "text": "The Toy Hearts are an English Bluegrass and Western Swing band from Birmingham.\nIts members are Stewart Johnson (Banjo, Dobro, Lap Steel) and his daughters Sophia (vocals, flatpicking guitar) and Hannah (lead vocals, Mandolin, songwriting).\nThe band cut their first record in 2006. The band is fronted by sisters Hannah and Sophia Johnson, who bring both a feminine, and British perspective, to an essentially American music. However, they keep one foot in the traditional camp by employing their father Stewart on banjo and dobro, while non-family members on double bass and fiddle complete the five-piece line-up.\nThey released ‘Femme Fatale’ in October 2010, which was recorded in Nashville earlier that year.\nToy Hearts have toured through the UK, the US and Europe and can count new rockabilly Queen ‘Imelda May,’ and veteran broadcaster Bob Harris amongst their fans.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nIf The Blues Comes Calling, WVR1 (2006)\nWhen I Cut Loose, WVR2 (2008)\nFemme Fatale, WVR3 (2010)\nWhiskey, WVR4 (2012)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

    "text": "One-T are a French animated band created in 2000 by Eddy Gronfier and Thomas Pieds. Eddy Gronfier produces the music while Thomas Pieds creates the artwork and visuals. They were successful across Europe, especially France and Germany, with their 2003 hit single \"The Magic Key\", but since then were not able to repeat that success and remained a one-hit wonder.\n\n\n== History ==\nOne-T made their first appearance in France during the summer of 2001, with the release of the single \"Music Is The One-T ODC\". The single was ranked the 82nd best-selling single over the year of 2001. It was followed shortly by the single \"Bein' a Star\".\nOne-T returned to the dance music scene in the summer of 2003 with their single \"The Magic Key\", which introduced One-T's best friend, Cool-T, as the rap singer in the song. The title reached 9th place of the single charts and was ranked the 22nd best-selling single for 2003. \"The Magic Key\" was also well received in Germany, Poland and Austria, where it reached fifth place of the single charts, and Denmark, where it reached fourth place. Their first full-length album, The One-T ODC, was released in July 2003.\nSeveral singles followed over the years, including  the theme song for the 2004 film Starsky & Hutch, and \"Kamasutra\", released in early 2005. However, none of them were very successful, and they remained a one-hit wonder in most parts of Europe.\nOne-T's second studio album, The One-T's ABC, was released in early 2006 as a digital album, and was available only on a few legal downloading sites, such as iTunes. In 2007, the album was released physically and garnered much success in France and the rest of Europe. \nIn honor of the 20th anniversary of the musical group One-T, in July 2022 album The One-T ODC was remastered. Also, a music video for the remastered song was released: \"The Magic Key 2\", together with Boogie Fre$h.\n\n\n== Creators ==\nThe cartoon characters in this band were created to conceal the real people behind this project. The people behind this project are Eddy Gronfier, responsible for the musical part of the project, is a former radio host (on NRJ, Fun Radio, Maxximum, M40 Rock ....), jingle producer (on RTL, Skyrock, M40, Radio Scoop ...), radio director (The monsters on Skyrock, Charly and Lulu on RTL 2 ...), and composer/ remixer of One-T, and Thomas Pieds, author of the concept and the song lyrics, is also the director of the One-T music videos.

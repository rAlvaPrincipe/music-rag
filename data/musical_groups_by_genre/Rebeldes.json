In the plot, the six main characters—Alice, Carla, Diego, Pedro, Roberta, and Tomás—form a fictitious band, and the six actors who play these characters—Sophia Abrahão, Melanie Fronckowiak, Arthur Aguiar, Micael Borges, Lua Blanco, and Chay Suede, respectively—started to act like a real band.\nRebeldes released their self-titled debut album on 30 September 2011 on EMI Music in partnership with Record Entertainment, and it reached third place in Brazil's official music chart, the CD – TOP 20 Weekly ABPD, for two consecutive weeks, with the initial single disc, Do Jeito Que Eu Sou, reaching seventeenth and twenty-first chart positions on the Hot 100 and Hot Pop, the Billboard Brazil, respectively. On 11 April 2012, the sextet released their first live album and DVD, entitled Rebeldes - Ao vivo, recorded during shows in São Paulo to 7,000 people.

The team participated in writing the rest of the album, which we released on 23 September 2011. \"Do Jeito Que Eu Sou\" came out as the first single, and was accompanied by an acoustic version, originally included on Rebeldes as a bonus track. On 6 November 2011, on the stage of Programa do Gugu, Rebeldes won their first gold record, for selling 50,000 copies of the record. This was certified by the Brazilian Association of Record Producers (ABPD). The band members said they dreamed of playing to national audiences.

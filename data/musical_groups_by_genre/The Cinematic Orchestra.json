    "text": "The Cinematic Orchestra is a British nu jazz and downtempo music group created in 1999 by Jason Swinscoe and later involving his music collaborator Dominic Smith. The group is signed to independent record label Ninja Tune.\nThe Cinematic Orchestra have produced four studio albums, Motion (1999), Every Day (2002), Ma Fleur (2007) and To Believe (2019), and two film soundtrack albums, Man with a Movie Camera (2003) and The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos (2009).\nIn addition to Swinscoe, the band includes former DJ Food member PC (Patrick Carpenter) on turntables, Luke Flowers on drums, Tom Chant on saxophone, Nick Ramm on piano, Stuart McCallum on guitar, Phil France on double bass. Former members include Jamie Coleman (trumpet), T. Daniel Howard (drums), Federico Ughi (drums), Alex James (piano), and Clean Sadness (synthesizer, programming). Heidi Vogel (vocals) appears as a regular collaborator.\nSwinscoe and Carpenter have also recorded together under the band name Neptune.\n\n\n== Style ==\nThe Cinematic Orchestra's sound, in both live and studio contexts, employs a live band which improvises along with a turntablist and electronic elements such as samples provided by Swinscoe. In their studio releases Swinscoe will often remix the live source material to produce a combination of live jazz improvisation with electronica, such that it is difficult to tell where the improvisation ends and the production begins.\n\n\n== History ==\nSwinscoe first formed a group called Crabladder in 1990, whilst studying Fine Art at Cardiff College, releasing one official single on his own Power Tools label. In 1994, Swinscoe was given a DJ spot on Heart FM, a pirate radio station in south London.\nThe Cinematic Orchestra's debut album, Motion, was released in 1999. The critical success of that album led to them being asked to perform at the Director's Guild Awards ceremony for the presentation of the Lifetime Achievement Award to film director Stanley Kubrick.\nThe band were asked by the organisers of the Porto European City of Culture 2001 festival to write a new score to Dziga Vertov's classic 1929 Soviet Union film Man with a Movie Camera, to be performed live in accompaniment with a showing of the silent film. The work differed from the band's usual compositions due to its live performance, ruling out the post production work that was present on Motion. The Cinematic Orchestra toured the work and later released it as an album. Many of the compositions originally created for that album, Man with a Movie Camera, were later adapted from live form (adding in vocal tracks and electronic elements, among other changes) for their next album, Every Day. It reached #54 in the UK Albums Chart in May 2002.\nIn 2006, the Cinematic Orchestra created a cover version of Radiohead's \"Exit Music (For a Film)\" that appeared on an album titled Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads. In this piece the band slowed down the tempo of the original, divided the timbre into four sections beginning with saxophone, to the classical guitar, to the electric guitar, ending the piece with the same simple acoustic guitar rhythm as the original.\nThe Cinematic Orchestra released the album Ma Fleur in May 2007. Several songs feature Patrick Watson, Fontella Bass, or Lou Rhodes on vocals, with Rhodes and Watson sharing vocals on one song.\nThe Cinematic Orchestra recorded the soundtrack to the Disneynature film The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos, released in France in December 2008 (originally as Les ailes pourpres: Le myst√®re des flamants). The score was produced by the band and Steve McLaughlin. The score was performed live with the London Metropolitan Orchestra at Union Chapel, Islington in September 2009 and won the award for Best Original Score for a Documentary Film at the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival in Wyoming, USA in October 2009.\nNinja Tune invited the Cinematic Orchestra to perform at the twentieth anniversary gala performance of the label at the Royal Albert Hall in November 2010.\nIn 2011, the Cinematic Orchestra commissioned a series of compositions for avant-garde short films that were performed at the Barbican Centre under the auspices of its curating a series entitled \"In Motion\" (also featuring Dorian Concept with saxophonist Tom Chant, Grey Reverend, and Austin Peralta). It subsequently released the album In Motion #1 in 2012.\nIn 2015, they created their own version of Melanie De Biasio's track \"I'm Gonna Leave You\" for the album Gilles Peterson presents - No Deal Remixed.\nTheir fourth studio album, To Believe, was released in March 2019.\n\n\n== Song appearances ==\n\n\"To Build a Home\", from the album Ma Fleur and featuring the vocals of the Canadian singer-songwriter Patrick Watson, has been used extensively in film and television.

The video was edited by freelance videographer Max Schlickenmeyer who posted it to YouTube, where it garnered more than 9 million views.

The song was also used in a UK advert for Sky Atlantic featuring Dustin Hoffman in front of a New York skyline. The advert was produced by WCRS. It is featured in the concluding scene of the 2013 Vanessa Hudgens film Gimme Shelter. More recently, it appeared in the 2016 film The Edge of Seventeen, and the 2016 Ubisoft Annecy video game Steep.

In 2017, the season five finale of Orange Is the New Black featured the song in its final scenes. In January 2018, the TV series This Is Us used the song during the ending of a second season episode. The song reappeared during the closing scene of a fourth season episode. It also featured in the documentary Best Wishes, Warmest Regards: A Schitt's Creek Farewell in 2020. It was also used in 2020 in a tribute video by the daughter of author Helen Harris, biographer of Edward Payson Weston.\nA shorter version of the song \"That Home\", with a slightly different composition, has also been used on occasion, such as an episode of Teen Wolf, in an episode of Suits, in the trailer for the 2011 film Another Earth and in the ABC drama Defying Gravity. It also featured in the season seven finale of the FOX dance competition So You Think You Can Dance. It was also featured in a trailer for the NBC drama Awake. It was also featured as one of the dance performance songs in the 2012 film Step Up Revolution.\nThe Public Radio Exchange radio show This American Life often uses the song \"Drunken Tune\" from the album Man with a Movie Camera.\nThe final scene and closing credits of the 2006 film Kidulthood feature the song \"All Things to All Men\" from the album Every Day.

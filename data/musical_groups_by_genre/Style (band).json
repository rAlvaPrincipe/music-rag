    "text": "Style is a Swedish pop band which had its greatest success in the 1980s. Style was formed by three former Freestyle members in 1983. They participated in the Swedish Melodifestivalen 1986 with their song \"Dover–Calais\" finishing third, and 1987 with their song \"Hand i hand\" finishing sixth. Style split in 1989 due to musical differences. They were reunited again for the Swedish Melodifestivalen 2003 with their song \"Stay the Night\". In 2006, Style returned for a nostalgia tour in Sweden and Norway. In 2009, Christer Sandelin and Tommy Ekman briefly reunited under the name of Style and released the compilation album Best Of Style with new tracks \"När Jag Ser Dig\" and \"Vill ha dej igen\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nLove Is Knocking on My Door/Längtar tillbaks till dig (1983)\nTelefon (1984)\nDu och jag (1985)\nVision av kärlek (1985)\nTelephone (1985) U.S. DANCE #16\nGive Me a Night to Remember/På jakt (efter guld som glimmar) (1986)\nDover–Calais (1986) SWE #1\nFölj mig (1986)\nHeaven No 7 (1986)\nShine On (1986)\nHand i hand (1987) SWE #20\nRun for Your Life (1987) SWE #4\nDaylight Robbery (1987)\nNew World (1987)\nEmpty Bed (1988) SWE #4\nIt's a Secret (1988) SWE #3\nQuestion of Time (1988)\nSentimental (1988)\nEmpty Bed (International release) (1989)\nStay the Night (2003)\nNär jag ser dig (2008)\nVill ha dej, igen (2009)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSo Chic (1983) SWE #32\nVisioner (1985)\nHeaven No 7 (1986) SWE #3\nDaylight Robbery (1987) SWE #7\n12 bästa (1987)\nQuestion of Time (1988) SWE #4\nSamlade hits (2003) SWE #7\nBest of Style - Det Ni Vill Ha (2008)\nVill ha dej igen (2009) #9\n\n\n== External links ==\nStyle discography at Discogs"

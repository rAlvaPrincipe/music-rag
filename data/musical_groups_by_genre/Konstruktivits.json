    "text": "Konstruktivits is a British industrial band. Formed in 1982, they were mostly active in the 1980s, with recording activity continuing until today.\nThe band was formed by Glenn Michael Wallis from his previous band Heute, a krautrock-influenced trio. 1990s members were Glenn Michael Wallis, Mark Crumby, Lawrence Burton, Joseph Ahmed, and R. Alcapone Shiells.\nGlenn Michael Wallis worked as musician on early releases by Whitehouse, he worked solo under the name of Vagina Dentata Organ with permission by Jordi Valls, and he was member of the band projects Dark Union, Heute, The Murray Fontana Orchestra as a side-project of Hafler Trio.\nMark Crumby was member of the bands Ghost Actor, Mitra Mitra, Oppenheimer MKII, and Statik.\nEarly associations between the band and the likes of Throbbing Gristle and Chris & Cosey cemented them as a member of the early industrial music scene, but did little for their success. Musically, Konstruktivits ranged across a spectrum of styles from noise to ambient to more beat-driven music. After a short hiatus in the late eighties, the album Forbidden introduced a more accessible sound in the tracks \"Tic, Tac, Toe,\" \"Hurts So Good,\" and \"She Loves It.\"\nIn 2000, Wallis changed the band's name to Konstruktivist, with the spelling Konstruktivists also being used. During the last years Wallis and Crumby run Konstruktivists as a duo.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nA Dissembly (Flowmotion LP, 1982)\nPsykho Genetika (Third Mind Records TM02 LP,  1983)\nBlack December (Third Mind Records TMLP05 LP, 1984)\nGlennascaul (Sterile Records SR10 LP, 1985)\nLive at the King Charles Ballroom (Harsh Reality Music HR46 cassette, 1985)\nSpanish Movements (Harsh Reality Music HR11 cassette, 1986; Alternate Media Tapes ALMED143 cassette, 1989)\nNKVD Compilation (with NKVD and Vagina Dentata Organ) (Audiofile Tapes aT77 cassette, 1989)\nForbidden (NKVD OGPU002 CD, 1992)\nPersona Non Grata (Interior Recordings INT CD 002, 1997)\nDark Odyssey (self-release, 2006)\nAnarchic Avcadia (Exklageto 12 CD, 2015)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\n\"Beirut\" (live) on Untitled (Requiem Productions cassette)\n\"Andropov '84\" on The Elephant Table Album (Xtract Xx001 2Ã—LP, 1983)\n\"Shadows of White Sand\" on Cadavres Exquis (Chimik Communications cassette, 1984)\n\"How You Say\" on Funky Alternatives Three (Concrete Productions/Pinpoint Records CD, 1989)\n\"Black on Black\" on Rising from the Red Sand Vol. 1 (RRRecords/Statutory Tapes STATAP 09 A cassette)\n\"Masonik 1\" on Rising from the Red Sand Vol. 3 (RRRecords/Statutory Tapes STATAP 09 C cassette)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKontruktivits (discogs.com)\nKonsort Archived 5 October 2007 at the Wayback Machine (home page)\nkonstruktivists.com (official home page)\nKonstruktivits at Last.fm"

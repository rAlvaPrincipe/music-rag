He appeared at the Salzburg Festival from 1922 to 1959, and created the leading role of Mandryka in Arabella by Richard Strauss, among others.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBorn Alois Wendelin in Brno, he is said to have studied at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna. He became operetta-Kapellmeister at the Stadttheater Passau in the 1912/13 season. The next season saw him in Winterthur and Zurich in 1915, where he served as répétiteur. A year later he also appeared as an actor, and from the 1915/16 season only as actor and singer. In 1917, he appeared as Lothario in Mignon by Ambroise Thomas. He appeared in the world premiere of Busoni's Turandot the same year.\nIn 1919 he became a member of the Bavarian State Opera through the mediation of Richard Strauss. In 1921, he moved on to the Vienna State Opera, where he worked until 1953, performing 150 roles. He also dealt with new arrangement of librettos. Among others, he wrote new versions for Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss and Donizeti's Don Pasquale for performances at the house. Jerger created the role of the Man in Schönberg's Die glückliche Hand at the Theater an der Wien in 1924. On 1 July 1933, he appeared in the leading role of Mandryka in the premiere of Arabella by Richard Strauss at the Semperoper in Dresden. Jerger performed opposite Viorica Ursuleac in the title role, with Clemens Krauss conducting.\nFrom 1922 to 1959, Jerger often took part in the Salzburg Festival, where he made his debut in the title role of Mozart's Don Giovanni, with Richard Strauss as the conductor. He also appeared as Sixtus Beckmesser in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler in 1938. He coached younger singers for their roles, such as George London for Don Giovanni and Eugene Onegin. In the film Unsterbliche Melodien (1936) he was seen in the leading role of the waltz king Johann Strauss. In 1945, the ensemble of the Vienna State Opera made him the provisional artistic director. In 1947 he was appointed professor at the Vienna Music Academy. Among his students was Leonie Rysanek.\nJerger undertook numerous tours and left behind many recordings. In 1969, at the age of 80, he took part in a recording of Der Rosenkavalier in the role of the notary.\nJerger died in Vienna on 18 November 1976 at age 87. His grave is located at the Vienna Central Cemetery (group 40, number 46).\n\n\n== Awards ==\nJerger was awarded the title Kammersänger in 1934, and received the Cross (Ritterkreuz I.

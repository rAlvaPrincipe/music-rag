    "text": "Try Anything Once is the first solo album by Alan Parsons, released in 1993. It was his first album following the split of the Alan Parsons Project.\nThis album features vocals by Ambrosia's David Pack, Jacqui Copland, former Mindbender and 10cc guitarist Eric Stewart, and Manfred Mann's Earth Band frontman Chris Thompson. The album features completely digital recording and mixing. It was recorded at Parson's first \"Parsonics\" studio in Sussex England with the orchestra recorded at Air Studios in London.\nThere is an Easter egg inside the inlay. One of the pictures is a stereogram; when the viewer looks at it correctly, an image of a man and woman upside down will appear, similar to the other pictures in the album's artwork. This image is also on the CD itself.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAlan Parsons – synthesizer, acoustic guitar, bass, flute, background vocals, producer\nIan Bairnson – synthesizer, bass, guitar, pedal steel guitar, background vocals\nRichard Cottle – synthesizer, saxophone\nAndrew Powell – bass, synthesizer, electric piano, autoharp, orchestra director\nStuart Elliott – drums, synthesizer\nDavid Pack – synthesizer, guitar, vocals\nJeremy Parsons – guitar\nPhilharmonia Orchestra – strings\nGraham Preskett – fiddle, violin, mandolin\nEric Stewart – vocals\nChris Thompson – vocals\nJacqui Copland – vocals, background vocals\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References =="

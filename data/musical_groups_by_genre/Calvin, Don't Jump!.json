    "text": "Calvin, Don't Jump! started as the solo recording project of J. Kirk Pleasant, a musician with extensive connections to the Elephant 6 Collective. Before moving to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, he contributed to releases from bands like the Olivia Tremor Control, Black Swan Network, and Pipes You See, Pipes You Don't. His own albums have featured contributions from musicians like Scott Spillane (Neutral Milk Hotel, the Gerbils), Jeremy Barnes (Neutral Milk Hotel, A Hawk and a Hacksaw), John D'Azzo (the Gerbils), as well as Peter Erchick, Eric Harris, and John Fernandes (all of the Olivia Tremor Control).\nEarly in 2007, Pleasant announced that what had begun as a solo project would expand into a four-piece band, geared towards a poppier, more guitar driven sound. The band featured Pleasant (vocals and guitar), Nathan Matthews (bass), Lee-Ann Sheel (drums), and Shinobu Hata (keyboards).\nCalvin, Don't Jump! released two full-length albums, as well as four 7-inch singles, a CDR of live recordings, and a cassette EP: Notes from Undersound. Pleasant's album Conscious of Conscience (2006) was his first true solo full-length album, drawing on assistance from no outside collaborators.\nThe band performed three concerts in 2010 and 2011 but appears to have broken up after that; its last social media post was in 2015.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Full-length albums ===\nCrystal Clear Mississippi (1999, self-released)\nA Way With Birds (2002, Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records)\nConscious of Conscience (2006, self-released)\nUnder Bridges (2010, self-released)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nLive on WFMU (Perhaps Transparent Records)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nCalvin, Don't Jump!/Echo Orbiter Split (2000, Perhaps Transparent Records) 7\"\nCalvin, Don't Jump!/Ooss (2000, Norman Records) 7\"\nRusty Gondola/The Bleating (2000, Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records) 7\"\nCrumble/Solamente La Euna Este Noche (Self-Released) 7\"\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nNotes From Undersound (1996, self-released)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nU.S. Pop Life Volume 5 (2000, Contact Records) CD\nWinter Report (2001, Hype City) CD\nHey, It's My Birthday!

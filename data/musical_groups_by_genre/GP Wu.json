The group formed in 1986 and were one of the many affiliates of The Wu-Tang Clan.\nAll four members appeared on fellow Wu-Tang affiliate Shyheim's first two albums 1994's AKA the Rugged Child and 1996's The Lost Generation, with their first official appearance as a group being on the track entitled \"5 Elements\" from the latter. The group released their first and only album Don't Go Against the Grain in 1998 through MCA Records. The album met with little success and only reached No. 44 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. Following the album, the group went their separate ways, with Pop da Brown Hornet being the only one to release a solo album, 2000's The Undaground Emperor.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References =="

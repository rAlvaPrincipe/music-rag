    "text": "Mr. Meeble was an electronic rock band from Phoenix, Arizona, formed in late 2005 by Devin Fleenor and Michael Plaster. The band grew its fan base primarily via websites such as YouTube, and continued to self-release music and videos on its label, Absolute Motion. They were regarded for their visually elaborated live shows, combining video projections, RGB lasers and other custom-made visual devices to enhance the mix of electronics and live instrumentation. A writer for Wired described their sound as \"coded into the musical matrix somewhere between Depeche Mode and Massive Attack\". Another journalist wrote that \"Mr. Meeble's sound falls somewhere between Radiohead and Stereolab\". In their own biography, the band names Thom Yorke and Air as influences.\n\n\n== Touring ==\nIn the fall of 2011, Mr. Meeble set off on a tour of 11 European countries.

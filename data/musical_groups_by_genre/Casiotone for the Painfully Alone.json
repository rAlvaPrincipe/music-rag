    "text": "Casiotone for the Painfully Alone (CFTPA) was the musical solo-project of musician Owen Ashworth (born April 22, 1977) of Redwood City, California.\nCFTPA was active from 1997 to 2010, and released five studio albums, alongside numerous other releases. CFTPA toured with other indie artists such as The Donkeys, Papercuts, P:ano, The Dead Science, David Bazan, The Rapture, and Xiu Xiu. Following the end of CFTPA, Ashworth began a new project, Advance Base.\n\n\n== History ==\nOwen Ashworth started CFTPA after dropping out of film school in 1997. The project was initially established under a set of Dogme 95-like rules: short songs, played in C, on the white notes of Casio keyboards. The band's musical style was characterized by the use of electronically-produced beats, cheap keyboards, and slow, frank lyrics. From Etiquette onwards, CFTPA widened in musical scope, adding more analog instruments and crafting an overall more organic sound.\nIn 2010, Ashworth announced that he was retiring Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, as well as the songs he wrote under that name, although he planned to continue making music under the name Advance Base. The project's final show was on December 5, 2010, the thirteen-year anniversary of its first show.\nIn 2011, Ashworth started the label Orindal Records, through which he releases his own music as Advance Base, as well as other artists including Gia Margaret and Dear Nora.\nOwen Ashworth's brother is Gordon Ashworth, who makes experimental harsh noise as Oscillating Innards and ambient works as Concern; Gordon also plays in grindcore/black metal project Knelt Rote.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Casiotone for the Painfully Alone albums ===\nAnswering Machine Music - CD/LP (Cassingle USA, 1999) (reissue: Tomlab, 2001)\nPocket Symphonies for Lonesome Subway Cars - CD/LP (Tomlab, 2001)\nTwinkle Echo - CD/LP (Tomlab, 2003)\nBobby Malone EP - LP (Tomlab, 2006)\nEtiquette - CD/LP (Tomlab, 2006)\nVs.

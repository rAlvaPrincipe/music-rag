A year later, the band began performing at the Orpheum Theatre, in Quebec City and on radio station CKAC in Montreal.

The band has  performed for the coronations of two Canadian monarchs (George VI in 1937 and Elizabeth II in 1953). It was present at the 300th, 350th, and 400th anniversary of Quebec City. The band resided at the Quebec’s Citadel until 1988, after which time it moved to the Canadian Forces Base at Valcartier near Quebec City.

    "text": "Niu Quaia is a mixed choir from Edermunde-Grifte, North Hesse, Germany, who sing rock, pop, soul and jazz. They are conducted by Thorsten Seydler, a professional musician based in Trendelburg, North Hesse, Germany.\nThe name Niu Quaia is pronounced in German as \"new choir\". The choir is one of two that belong to the 125-year-old 'Gesangvereins 1889 Grifte' (Choral Society of Grifte); the other one is the  Young Voices.\nNiu Quaia was founded on 18 June 1997. They celebrated their fifteenth anniversary in 2012 and their twentieth anniversary in 2017.\nThe choir consists of ca. 30–35 people who rehearse every Tuesday from 8–10 pm in the village town hall in Edermünde-Grifte. Every year there is one weekend workshop and every two years they go on tour. In 2011 the choir gave a concert in Berlin; in 2013 the choir went to Bedfordshire, England for 4 days, and, in 2015, the choir went to Vienna, Austria for 4 days.\n\n\n== Concerts ==\nOld Botanical Garden of Göttingen University, Göttingen, 2 September 2012\nEdermunde-Grifte Church, 23.

    "text": "MonkeyJunk is a Canadian rock and roll/swamp/blues band, based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The band has won two Juno Awards for Blues Album of the Year.\nThe band won in 2012 for their album To Behold and in 2018 for their latest release Time to Roll.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in Ottawa, Canada, in 2008.  Band members are Steve Marriner on vocals, baritone guitar, harmonica, Hammond organ; Tony D. (Tony Diteodoro) on lead guitar; and Matt Sobb on drums and percussion.  Marriner had been playing a weekly solo show at Irene's Pub in Ottawa, frequently inviting guests to join him.  An occasionally recurring guest was Tony D and he once asked Sobb to join too but never together.  Marriner and D struck up the idea to try a three piece (two guitars, drums and no bass) and since Sobb had been playing with Tony D. for approximately eight years, and before that time with Marriner in another project, he was called to start this new project on the last Sunday of March 2008.   The band members are from different age cohorts, with Tony D. and Sobb being respectively twenty-two and twelve years older than Marriner (born 1984).\nThe band formation does not include a bass player. Such a formation is found in a number of notable classic blues bands, such as Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers. The band's name comes from an interview with Son House, who described the blues as being about love, stating \"I'm talking about the blues.  I ain't talkin' 'bout monkey junk\".\nMonkeyJunk has been a frequent winner at the Maple Blues Awards, and the band's album To Behold won the 2012 Juno Award for Blues Album of the Year as did their latest album Time To Roll in 2018.\nThe band maintains a busy touring schedule, touring across Canada, into the United States and across Europe as well.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== Maple Blues Awards ===\n2013 Songwriter of the year\n2013 Recording of the year (All Frequencies)\n2013 Electric act of the year\n2013 Entertainer of the year\n2012 Electric act of the year\n2011 Recording of the year (To Behold)\n2011 Electric act of the year\n2010 Electric act of the year\n2009 Entertainer of the year\n2009 Electric act of the year\n\n\n=== Canadian Independent Music Awards ===\n2014 Blues Artist/Group or Duo of the Year\n2010 Favourite Blues Artist/Group\n\n\n=== Juno Awards ===\n2012 winner Blues album of the year (To Behold)\n2014 nomination Blues album of the year (All Frequencies)\n2018 winner Blues album of the year (Time to Roll)\n\n\n=== Blues Music Awards ===\n2010 Best New Artist Debut\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2016 Time To Roll (Stony Plain)\n2015 Moon Turn Red (Stony Plain)\n2014 Tiger in Your Tank (Stony Plain)\n2013 All Frequencies (Stony Plain)\n2011 To Behold (Stony Plain)\n2009 Tiger in Your Tank (Independent)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

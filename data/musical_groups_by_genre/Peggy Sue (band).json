    "text": "Peggy Sue are an English indie pop/indie folk band from Brighton.  The band have toured with a number of well-known indie artists including Mumford & Sons, The Maccabees, First Aid Kit, Kate Nash, and Jack White.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeggy Sue were formerly known as Peggy Sue and the Pirates and Peggy Sue and the Pictures. In June 2008, the band announced that they were shortening their name from Peggy Sue and the Pirates to just Peggy Sue. The band have also released music under the name of Peggy Sue and the Pictures, a collaboration with Left with Pictures, and Peggy Sue and Les Triplettes.\nOn 10 April 2009, it was announced that Peggy Sue had signed to US-based Yep Roc Records, and the label was releasing Body Parts EP for free.\nOn 9 December 2009, Peggy Sue signed with Wichita Recordings, and the label released the band's debut album Fossils and Other Phantoms in April 2010.\nOn 12 September 2011, the second album Acrobats came out on Wichita Recordings, to a generally positive critical response.\nIn 2011, the band were invited to perform a live soundtrack to a film at a temporary cinema in Hackney, East London. They chose Kenneth Anger's 1963 cult classic Scorpio Rising, mostly because of its groundbreaking rock n' roll/doo wop soundtrack. The band's subsequent album \"Peggy Sue Play the Songs of Scorpio Rising\" was released 18 September 2012 via Yep Roc Records and features 12 new arrangements of songs from the film.\nYep Roc Records announced a new full-length album Choir of Echoes to be released in the US 29 January 2014. Choir of Echoes was produced at the legendary Rockfield Studio in South Wales by Jimmy Robertson and mixed by longtime collaborator John Askew. Of the record, the band say \"Choir of Echoes is an album about singing. About losing your voice and finding it again. Voices keeping each other company and voices competing for space. The call and response of the kindest and the cruelest words. Choruses. Duets. Whispers and shouts.\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nFossils and Other Phantoms (Wichita, Yep Roc) April 2010\nAcrobats (Wichita, Yep Roc) September 2011\nPeggy Sue Play the Songs of Scorpio Rising (ep), September 2012\nChoir of Echoes, January 2014\nVices, February 2020\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\"The Body Parts EP\" was released on Monday 4 August 2008 on a limited run of 500.

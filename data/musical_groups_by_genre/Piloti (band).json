    "text": "Piloti (Serbian Cyrillic: Пилоти, trans. The Pilots) is a rock band from Belgrade. Formed in 1981, and initially immersed in the Yugoslav new wave scene, the band later moved towards mainstream pop rock, they came to prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s as one of the leading pop rock acts in former Yugoslavia. The band disbanded in 1997, only to be reformed in 2009 under the name Kiki Lesendrić & Piloti.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== New wave years (1981—1982) ===\nThe band was formed in 1981, by the former members of Kako, a band whose greatest claim to fame was appearing as one of the seven opening acts for Bijelo Dugme spectacular concert at the Belgrade JNA stadium in 1979. The inaugural lineup of Piloti was: Zoran \"Kiki\" Lesendrić (vocals, guitar), Dragan Andrić (bass guitar), Goran Bogićević (guitar) and Nenad Antanasijević (drums).\n\nTheir debut album Piloti (The Pilots) was released on August 27, 1981 by PGP-RTB and produced by the former Generacija 5 guitarist Dragan Jovanović. All of the tracks were composed and written by Lesandrić, with the exception of \"Imam diplomu\", \"Svi smo mi ponekad anđeli\" and \"Veseli momci\", co-written by Lesandrić and Goran Bogićević. Song \"Ne veruj u idole\" (\"Don't Believe in Idols\") became an instant hit, and was included on several new wave compilation records.\nAfter the success with their debut album, the followup, entitled Dvadeset godina (Twenty Years) was released on April 20, 1982 by PGP-RTB, and was produced by Saša Habić. All tracks were composed and written by Lesandrić including the minor hits \"Dvadeset godina\" (\"Twenty Years\"), \"Noć u gradu\" (\"A Night in the City\"), \"Džoni je krenuo u rat\" (\"Johnny Went to War\") and \"Ja sam jurio za vetrom\" (\"I Have Chased the Wind\"). During late 1982, the band started working on their third album, Zvuci civilizacije (The Sounds of Civilisation), which was never released because of Lesandrić's army obligations, and the band went on hiatus.\n\n\n=== Mainstream rock years (1984-1991) ===\nPiloti re-assembled during the late 1984 with the entirely new line-up, featuring Kiki Lesendrić, as the only returnee from the original lineup, and the newly arrived Zoran \"Ćera\" Obradović (drums), Safet \"Saja\" Petrovac (guitar), and Miško Plavi, formerly of D' Boys (bass guitar).\nThe band's third album Kao ptica na mom dlanu (Like a Bird on My Palm) was released on May 25, 1987 by PGP-RTB and produced by Dušan Petrović \"Šane\". The author of all songs was Lesendrić, except for \"Noć čeka nas\" (\"The Night Is Waiting for Us\") which he co-wrote with Bogićević and \"Pišem po zidu\" (\"I'm Writing on the Wall\") with Ilija Stanković.

The author of all the songs was Lesandrić. Musicians who contributed to this album were Saša Lokner (keyboards), Bane Lesendrić (backing vocals), Viktorija (backing vocals in song \"Sa tvoje strane ulice\") and Zoran Vračević (percussion). The greatest hit from this album was \"Leto\" (\"Summer\") and minor hits were \"Ako misliš da sam tužan\" (\"If You Think I'm Sad\") and \"Ona\" (\"She\").

The author of songs was Kiki, except for \"Jedino što nam ostaje\" (\"The Only Thing Left\") (a cover of Pete Townshend) and \"Tiho, tiho\" (\"Silently, Silently\") by Bane Lesandrić.

The following year, on August 22, 1991 PGP-RTB published Piloti's Greatest Hits album.\n\n\n=== Commercial peak, disbandment (1993-1997) ===\nIn 1993 Piloti published the soundtrack for the movie Zaboravljeni (The Forgotten Ones) for PGP-RTS. The songs were written by Lesandrić, Marina Tucaković, Goran Bregović (the track \"Spavaju li oči nebeske\" (\"Do the Eyes in the Sky Sleep\")) and Laza Ristovski (the title track).

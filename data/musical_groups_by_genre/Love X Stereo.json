    "text": "Love X Stereo (Korean: 러브엑스테레오) is an electro duo from Seoul, Korea. Consisting lead vocalist and synthesizer player Annie Ko and guitarist and producer Toby Hwang, the duo debuted in 2011 by releasing an EP album called Buzzin'.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nAnnie Ko: lead vocals, synthesizers\nToby Hwang: producer, guitar, bass, synthesizers\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1998-2011: 18Cruk and Skrew Attack ===\nIn 1998, Toby Hwang, then-bassist for Korean punk rock band 18Cruk, decided to quit to from a new 3-piece band, Skrew Attack. Inspired by the faster-paced sounds of bands like NOFX, Black Flag, Bad Religion, and Minor Threat, Hwang cycled through numerous lineup changes with Skrew Attack before meeting vocalist Annie Ko in the Hongdae neighborhood in 2005. Ko had attended Ewha Womans University and Seoul National University (studying physics and astronomy, respectively), before pursuing a career as a singer. Hwang and Ko remained core members of Skrew Attack until 2011.\n\n\n=== 2011-present: Name change and Love X Stereo ===\nDriven by a desire to branch out from their punk rock beginnings, Hwang and Ko decided to change the band's name to Love X Stereo, a name derived from Hwang's record label Stereo City Records. In a 2013 interview with Schoolkids Records' BLURT Magazine, Hwang states: We did punk rock for years and years, so this time we wanted to do something different, something that isn’t necessarily punk rock, and something fresh and new. We love to add experimental flavor into our music, adding different elements from different genres that we like, such as trip hop, electro, alternative rock etc. So, changing band name was quite inevitable.Love X Stereo released their debut EP, Buzzin' on December 28, 2011, incorporating elements of electronic music not previously featured in Skrew Attack's music. Subsequent releases have continued to feature heavy use of synthesizers and drum machines, further developing their electro-rock sound.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== LP ===\n\n\n=== EP ===\n\n\n=== V/A ===\n\n\n== International Festivals ==\nMusic Matters Live 2023 (Singapore)\nMu:Con 2023 (Seoul)\nKOBA 2023 (Seoul)\nNAMM Believe in Music Week 2021 (Global Streaming)\nMu:Con 2020 (Seoul)\nUbud Food Festival 2019 (Bali)\nReeperbahn 2018 (Hamburg)\nAPaMM (Asia Pacific Music Meeting) 2018 (Ulsan)\nBaybeats 2018 (Singapore)\nFOCUS Wales 2017 (Wrexham)\nPentaport Rock Festival 2016 (Incheon)\nKCON (music festival) 2016 (Los Angeles)\nSouth by Southwest 2016 (Austin)\nVans New Wave Musicfest 2015 (Bangalore)\nMu:Con 2015 (Seoul)\nZandari Festa 2015 (Seoul)\nCanadian Music Week 2015 (Toronto)\nCMJ Music Marathon 2014 (New York City)\nCulture Collide 2014 (Los Angeles, San Francisco)\nHyundai Card CityBreak 2014 (Seoul)\nUltra Music Festival 2014 (Seoul)\nMusic Matters Live 2014 (Singapore)\nSouth by Southwest 2014 (Austin)\nCMJ Music Marathon 2013 (New York City)\nIndie Week Canada 2013 (Toronto)\nZandari Festa 2012 (Seoul)\nJisan Valley Rock Festival 2012 (Icheon)\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2018 Best Music Video: Rage Is Not Enough (Canada International Film Festival)\n2017 Best Music Video: Nominee (Girona Film Festival)\n2017 Best Dance & Electronic Album of the Year: Nominee (Korean Music Awards)\nK-Rookies 2014 Annual Finals: Runner-Up (Korea Creative Content Agency)\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial Website\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nSoundCloud\nInstagram\n\n\n== References =="

Their music had a strong folk influence, with a focus on poetry and melody.

There, the group's \"contemplative gourmet pop\" music style was described as \"organic guitar, hard-hitting synths, and wistful vocals\". On 7 July 2015, CHINAH released their debut single, \"Away from Me\". The song, which was written in early Spring 2014, was the first release from their debut 5-track EP. On 27 August 2015, CHINAH released \"We Go Back\", their second single from their debut EP.\nIn February 2016 they released the EP Once The Lights Are On.

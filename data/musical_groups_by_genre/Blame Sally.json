The members of the group include Pam Delgado (percussion and vocals), Renee Harcourt (guitar and vocals), Rob Strom (bass guitar), Jeri Jones (guitar, bass and vocals), and Monica Pasqual (piano, accordion, and vocals).\nThe group was formed in 2000, and in 2001, KFOG \"began playing the band's music on the popular 'Acoustic Sunrise' show, leading to more gigs and bigger venues\"; the band \"got national attention through XM Radio\" and \"by the end of 2006, the band was playing more than 50 shows a year.\"\nAllmusic praises their 2007 album, Severland as \"the first on which they sound more like a proper band than four solo artists working collectively,\" and gives it a rating of 4.5 stars.  As of 2009, the band was signed for a three-album, five-year contract worth a half-million dollars. In 2010, Blame Sally released Live at Stern Grove Festival, recorded at San Francisco's Stern Grove Festival in 2009 on a date that was headlined by the legendary Joan Baez.\nAlso in 2010, Germany saw its first taste of Blame Sally with a 15 date tour across the country. The band played in myriad venues from inns to The House of Blues. In summer 2012, Blame Sally toured Germany for the second time, also visiting neighboring countries such as Italy and Switzerland with support from their record label Ninth Street Opus. The band played in venues from cafes to clubs such as TECnet during the month-long tour.\nIn October 2012, Blame Sally made its first appearance across the United Kingdom during their two-week tour.

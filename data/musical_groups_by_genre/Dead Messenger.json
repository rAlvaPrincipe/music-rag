    "text": "Dead Messenger is a Canadian power pop/rock band from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. They have released 3 albums, and their frenetic, high energy live performances have garnered them a reputation as one of the best live bands in Montreal.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Band was formed in 2005 by Roger White (guitar, lead Vox) Ted Yates (lead guitar) Sebastien Marin (bass) and Charlton Snow (drums). In 2006 they released a self-titled album that was recorded by ex Planet Smashers Drummer Tim Doyl in Montreal and mixed by Jordon Zadorozny at his French Kiss Studios in Pembroke, Ontario.\nIn 2007 Dead Messenger went on hiatus and Sebastien Marin left the band. In early 2008 the band reformed with Alex Chavel on bass and began working on new material. In the fall of that year they recorded Love Is the Only Weapon at Breakglass Studios in Montreal. The album was produced by Jonathan Cummins (ex doughboys, Bionic) and engineered by Jace Lasek (The Besnard Lakes).\nThe band has played such festivals as Pop Montreal, Canadian Music Week, NXNE, Pitter Patter Fest and UnPop Montreal, as well as performing live at the 2011 GAMIQ awards (Gala Alternatif de la Musique Indépendante du Québec).\nLove Is The Only Weapon was rated 96 on CKUT Montreal top 100 Albums chart for 2009.\nIn Feb 2013 Dead Messenger released \"Recharger\". The album was initially intended to be a follow-up EP to \"Love Is The Only Weapon\" and was to be released in early 2011. \"Recharger\" was being recorded at The Pound, an underground live venue/art gallery/cultural space and home base to the band. Recording was cut short due to the Pound having to close its doors as the result of a lack of permits. Shortly after this lead guitarist Ted Yates became seriously ill and spent the better part of a year in and out of the hospital. White, Chavel, and Snow briefly considered disbanding the group as the severity of Yates's illness became apparent, but decided to continue on and record a full-length at the urging of Yates, with Yates contributing as a writer but unable to attend pre production rehearsals. Using Yates's condition as an inspiration, \"Recharger\" explores themes of life, death, and starting over, and has a much more conceptual and atmospheric feel than its predecessor.\nRecharger was recorded by Roger White and Alex Chavel and Mixed By Aaron Holmberg \n\"Recharger\" debuted in Feb 2013 at #167 in the top 200 national college radio chart in Canada.\nCharlton Snow left the band in the Summer of 2015, he was replaced by Tim Harbinson formerly of the band Laki Mera.\nIn 2015, four of the band's songs were featured in CBC's critically acclaimed drama This Life.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nRoger White - Guitar, Lead Vox (2005–present)\nTed Yates - Lead Guitar, Vox (2005–present)\nTim Harbinson - Drums (2015–present)\nAlex Chavel - Bass, Vox (2008–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nSebastien Marin - Bass, Vox (2005–2007)\nCharlton Snow - Drums (2005–2015)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDead Messenger (2006)\nLove Is The Only Weapon (2009)\nRecharger (2013)\nThe Owl in Daylight(2016)\n\n\n== Videography ==\nFat Black Heart (2009)\nToothcomb (2013)\nCan't Help Myself (2013)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\ndeadmessenger.net\nDead Messenger - FAT BLACK HEART\nEcoutez.ca - Découvrez, partagez et encouragez la musique du Québec\nNow Toronto"

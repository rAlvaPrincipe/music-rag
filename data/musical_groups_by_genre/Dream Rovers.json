    "text": "Dream Rovers  is a country music band in Tehran, Iran and introduced as the pioneer of country music in Iran.\nThe main members of the band are Erfan Rezayatbakhsh (elf) (singer/songwriter), and Ahmad Motevassel (lead guitar and recording engineer).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Persian Rovers ===\nIn January 2007 the band was formed under the name of \"Persian Rovers\" in Tehran by Erfan Rezayatbakhsh as the singer. The main activity of Persian Rovers was covering old songs. This procedure went on until Erfan came back from his military conscription in April 2007 and the band decided to start recording their original songs. With respect to this subject, they started working on the songs written by Erfan. In October that year Persian Rovers collapsed while they had only succeeded in preparing a demo for the song February Snow.\n\n\n=== Dream Rovers ===\nAfter the end of Persian Rovers, Erfan started recruiting by talking to Majid Sadeghi with whom he got acquainted years ago at university.\n\n\n== 2008–present ==\nIn March 2008, when the band was working on the arrangement of \"Cloudy Sky\" Majid met Ahmad Motevasel, who was a self taught guitar player. \n\n\n== New members ==\nWhile completing the arrangement of Cloudy Sky a need for piano seemed to be obvious. Therefore, Erfan asked his blind friend, Parham Doustdar, to join the band, whose cooperation with the band lasted until the completion of their debut album, Off the Road. Afterwards, Parham left the band.\n\n\n== Innovations ==\nLiving in a non-American society and culture, along with members having different musical tastes have led to some innovations in their rendition of country music such as switching the style of the song from country to rock and sometimes switching back to country.\n\n\n== Instrumentalists ==\nHoneyeh Rezayatbakhsh: Violin (elf's sister who usually cooperates with the band in studio as violinist and recording supervisor)\nMakan Mahmoudi: Bass Guitar (has accompanied the band in their all concerts in SUT)\nMohammad Shojaie: Drums (has cooperated with the band in studio and 2011 SUT concert as the drummer)\n\nSoheil Rezanejad: Piano (accompanied the band in second and third SUT concert as the pianist)\nOmid Mazra'e : Drums (the 2012 SUT Concert drummer)\nParham Doustdar: ( Recording supervisor, Pianist in studio and first concert at SUT)\nMajid Sadeghi: (Bass player of four songs in the band's debut album Off the Road)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Flashback Album ===\ncover of songs from the 1970s and before|\nTrack listing: (as shown on the cover of the album)\n\n              Don't Play Your Rock'n'Roll To Me……………  Mike Chapman (1975)\n              Sixteen Tons…………………………………………….

So, that would be a good idea for the superstar to sing about her living-in-misery fans sometimes.\nThe video of the song was directed by Ali T and shot in Tehran in the last day of 2011.\n\n\n=== Without Even Saying Goodbye ===\nA fusion of Persian traditional music and country music written by elf.

In 1926, the Academic Orchestra gained its independence and became the Ylioppilaskunnan Soittajat.\n\n\n== Conductors ==\nA number of world-famous Finnish conductors started their careers as principal or assistant conductor of the Ylioppilaskunnan Soittajat, including Paavo Berglund, Okko Kamu and Susanna MÃ¤lkki.\n\nPrincipal conductors of Ylioppilaskunnan Soittajat\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

    "text": "The Pennywhistlers were an American singing group founded by folklorist and singer Ethel Raim and popular during the 1960s folk music revival. They specialized in Eastern European polyphonic vocal music, traditional and arranged, sung primarily a cappella. Folk singer Theodore Bikel, in his autobiography Theo, called them \"the closest to the real thing in authenticity in the United States.\" Their repertoire also featured traditional American songs. The Pennywhistlers toured throughout the 1960s, appearing at the Sing Out! hootenanny at Carnegie Hall, the Fox Hollow Festival, and the Mariposa Folk Festival, among others. They shared the bill with performers such as Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Reverend Gary Davis, Leonard Cohen, and many others.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nThe Pennywhistlers (Folkways Records FW-8773, 1963)\nThe Pennywhistlers: A Cool Day and Crooked Corn (Nonesuch H-72024, 1965)\nThe Pennywhistlers – Songs From Everywhere (Verve Folkways – FV-9034, 1966, mono)\nThe Pennywhistlers – Songs From Everywhere (Verve Folkways – FVS-9034, 1966, stereo)\nThe Pennywhistlers: Folksongs of Eastern Europe (Nonesuch H-72007, 1967)\nSongs of the Earth (with Theodore Bikel) (Elektra)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEthel Raim at the Association for Cultural Equity website"

    "text": "The Budapest Quartet was a string quartet established in Budapest in 1886 by Jenő Hubay and David Popper.\nJohannes Brahms performed with the quartet and thought it was the best he had heard.\nThis quartet went under a variety of names. Outside Hungary, it was usually called \"Quartet Hubay-Popper\". Within Hungary it was called \"Hungarian Quartet\" or \"Budapest Quartet\". This was because Hungarians were fiercely patriotic.\nThey performed for twenty-seven years.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe quartet's initial composition was:\n\nJenő Hubay, first violin\nViktor Herzfeld, second violin\nBram Eldering, viola\nDavid Popper, cello\nHerzfeld played in 1886-1889 and 1897-1899. Wilhelm Grünfeld (concertmaster of Budapest Opera) played in 1888 the 2nd violin and 1889 József Bloch (later a teacher at the Music Academy). After then, two students of Hubay played the 2nd violin: in 1894 János Farkas and from 1895 Rudolf Kemény. Elderling left the quartet soon. Violist from 1888 was Josef Waldbauer and from 1898 Gustav Szerémi.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nPotter, Tully (1999). \"From chamber to concert hall\". In Stowell, Robin (ed.).

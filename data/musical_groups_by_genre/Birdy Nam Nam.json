    "text": "Birdy Nam Nam are a DJ crew from France. Birdy Nam Nam has won several prizes throughout their career including the DMC Technics 2002 World TEAM Championships. Birdy Nam Nam's goal is to use the turntable player as an actual musical instrument. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2006 on Uncivilized World Records, and in March that year, they performed at the internationally renowned music conference SXSW.  The group's name is taken from a line in the 1968 Peter Sellers film The Party, directed by Blake Edwards.\n\n\n== History ==\nBirdy Nam Nam sources their music from friends and their own albums, pressing beats and patterns into vinyl to assemble their music live.\nIn 2010, the band won the Electronic or Dance revelation of the year at the Victoires de la Musique. In 2012 they gained a wider audience in the Anglophone world thanks to Skrillex. At the Festival des Artefacts in Strasbourg, Skrillex played after Birdy Nam Nam and was impressed.

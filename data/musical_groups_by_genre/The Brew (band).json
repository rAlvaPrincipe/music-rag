They were voted \"best band\" 2006/7  by \"It's Only Rock & Roll\" magazine (the magazine of the Rolling Stones fanclub). The band was described by rock critic Michael Arens as \"earthy, fertile, and sometimes wonderfully grainy\" and creating \"flawless rock\" with a \"touch of Psychedelic,\" and described by RockTimes critic Joachim 'Joe' Brookes as a \"bridge between the sixties and seventies\".\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nIn early July 2007, The Brew headlined the Maasboulevard Festival in Schiedam, the Netherlands and were invited back to perform in 2008.\nIn 2006, The Brew were a success at The Rock ‘n’ Blues Custom Show at Pentrich, Derbyshire, they were asked to do a second gig by the organisers on the following day on the Centre Stage, and they were then booked to return in 2007. In August that year The Brew  performed on The British Stage at the UK’s biggest R’n’B festival in Colne, Lancashire. In 2008 they headlined the festival on the Sunday, on the British stage.\nThe Brew completed a set for the national Belgium radio station, Classic 21 and were filmed by the national television France 2, for their performance at that year's Festival in France, Le Blues Autour Du Zinc. They have performed at the National Classic 21 Radio Station, RTBF Showcase Festival in Brussels.\nIn 2009, The Brew received national recognition throughout Germany when their performance at Rockpalast Festival was broadcast across the country and beyond, on WDR TV and they performed again on Rockpalast in 2012 and 2017.\nThe Brew returned to the recording studio and the result, A Million Dead Stars, was released in January 2010.\n\n\n== Band lineup ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Brew (April 2006)\nFate and Time E.P.

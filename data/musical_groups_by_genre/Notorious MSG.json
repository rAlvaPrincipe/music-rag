    "text": "Notorious MSG is a performing trio of Asian American rappers founded in 2002 in Chinatown, Manhattan, New York City. Their songs are parodies of gangster rap mixed with Asian American culture, featuring lyrics about gangster lifestyles and Chinese food and boasting innuendos regarding women. Their group name is a parody of Brooklyn rapper The Notorious B.I.G., with \"MSG\" referring to monosodium glutamate, a sodium additive commonly used in East Asian cuisines.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group says that they all met in the kitchen of the Chinese restaurant in which they worked. It has been suggested that they have more middle-class origins, pointing to evidence which includes a reference to Cornell University in one of their songs.\n\n\n== Group members ==\nHong Kong Fever: The ringleader; from Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong; worked as a waiter.\nDown-Lo Mein: (or D-Lo), the \"Yellow Gigolo\". From Ping-tun, Taiwan; worked as a cook.\nFutomaki: One of the original members; had to leave the group due to the deportation by the INS in 2003; from Japan; worked as a cook.\nFunky Buddha: (September 8, 1973 â€” October 2, 2005). Real name Benson Lam. Replaced Futomaki; from mainland China; worked as a dishwasher; according to the group, Funky Buddha was supposedly killed outside of a restaurant in Chinatown in a drive-by shooting.\nThe Hunan Bomb: The Killing Machine, Replaced Funky Buddha after Funky Buddha's untimely death; from Inchon, South Korea; used to make a living as an underground fighter.\n\n\n=== Supporting members ===\nNoodles, drummer. From Hiroshima, Japan.\nBilly D. Wang, guitarist. From Hollywood, Florida.\nMr. Lucky, bass guitarist. Also from Japan.\nAngus Wong.\nIn 2006, PRI's The World reported that the trio was in negotiations with Comedy Central to develop a series.\nNotorious MSG's website had a few singles for download. Their first cut, \"Wok the Party\", was received with mediocre fanfare. Shortly thereafter, they released three singles (such as Chinatown Hustler) that showed their potential for splicing rhymes to background beats, and garnered much popularity.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nIn 2003 and 2004 Notorious MSG started to give small, organized concerts, generally to a few hundred people at any given time. One of their earliest performances was given at Rutgers University. Their first West Coast performance, given in February 2005, just outside Los Angeles, was part of a night of Asian-themed stand up comedy.\nThey performed on August 4 and 5 at the Vans Warped Tour 2007 (Nassau Coliseum and Raceway Park, NJ).\nIn recent years, the Notorious MSG has also performed in various music venues in New York City, such as Bowery Ballroom, CBGB's (just before it closed), Santos Party House and Brooklyn Bowl.\nAfter concerts they stay around to mingle with the audience, sign autographs and have their pictures taken. The members stay in character during and after the event.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nIn the Fall of 2004, Notorious MSG released their first album, Die Hungry. It is approximately 35 minutes, with four interludes and eight songs, of which one is a remix.\nTrack list:\n\nIntro\nStraight out of Canton\nHeat it Up\nHong Kong Heartbreak (Sketch)\nDim Sum Girl\nChinese Funk\nBuddha Time (Sketch)\nEgg Rollin'\nLast Meal (Sketch)\nStreets of Chinatown\nYello Fever (feat.

The single is different from the original version heard on Die Hungry, featuring new instrumental pieces.\n\"F.O.B. (Fresh off the Boat) For Life\", a song boasting about their physical attributes and skills. This song is nowhere to be found on Die Hungry.\n\"Dim Sum Girl\", a love ballad about the heartbreak of Hong Kong Fever from his former love, a dim sum girl (woman pushing around carts of dim sum in Chinese restaurants). It was featured in a Chinese reality television show.\n\"Kowloon Bay\", a love ballad similar in flavor to Dim Sum Girl where Hong Kong Fever reminisces about his first love back in Kowloon Bay (a district in Hong Kong).\n\"Chinatown Hustler\", a song about the life of a Chinatown gangster. This is also the single in which The Hunan Bomb is first heard. The music video officially aired on August 14, 2006.  It is found on the video game original soundtrack of \"Wet\".\n\"Traditional Roughnecks\"\n\"Old Shanghai\" This song has been very hard to locate, since it was made very early on in the formation of Notorious MSG. Drinking a cup of Oolong Tea (\"For days of Old Shanghai my dear, For days of Old Shanghai, We'll drink a cup of oolong tea, For the days of Old Shanghai\") is the main action that is performed in the song's lyrics.\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\"Straight Out of Canton\", their first music video, features scenes of working in the kitchen and raising hell in the streets of the Chinatown ghetto.\n\"Chinatown Hustler\", features the life of a Chinatown gangster. It's a hard life when you're driving a pimpin' car around town, selling drugs, breaking up gambling parties and cavorting with ladies of the night.\n\"Red Tonight\" features the Notorious MSG jamming in a Chinatown rock club, along with a group of hard-partying friends.\n\"Wonton Violence\" has them dressed in leather and sunglasses showing off how tough they are in a martial arts gym.\n\n\n== Schoolhousin' videos ==\nA web series on lessons from the Chinatown hood, as told by the Notorious MSG.

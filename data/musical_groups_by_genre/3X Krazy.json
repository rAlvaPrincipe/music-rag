Although an album was never released under AWOL Records, Dual Committee appeared on two songs on fellow label-mate C-Bo's second release, The Autopsy. After parting ways with AWOL, B.A.aka Lamore Jacks (then known as Bart AKA Mr Kamikaze) joined the group and 3X Krazy was formed.\n\n\n=== 1995-2003 ===\nThe group's debut EP Sick-O was released in 1995, and although not a commercial success, the group still managed to attract the attention of a major record label, Virgin Records who signed the group in 1996. 3X Krazy's only released for Virgin was 1997's Stackin Chips, which would prove to be the group's most successful release, making it to 136 on the Billboard 200, 28 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and 6 on the Top Heatseekers album charts. 3X Krazy would later release 1999's Immortalized and 2000's Real Talk 2000 before disbanding. In 2003, 3X Krazy released their fifth album Flowamatic-9, which featured remixed songs from their first album as well as previously unreleased songs. \n\n\n=== 2022 ===\nIn July 2022, 3X Krazy performed together for the first time in 10 years.\n\n\n=== Influence ===\nIn his 1996 track Record Haters, rapper E-40 credits 3X Krazy with teaching him the phrase \"fa sheezy\", birthing a new way of speaking.

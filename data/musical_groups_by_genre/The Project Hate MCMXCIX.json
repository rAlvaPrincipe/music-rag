    "text": "The Project Hate MCMXCIX (often referred to as TPH) is a Swedish death metal band with influences from electro-industrial music.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Project Hate MCMXCIX was formed in 1999 by long-time friends Lord K Philipson (formerly of Leukemia, House of Usher, Lame, Toolshed, Torture Division, as well as doing session work as live bassist/guitarist for Candlemass, Vomitory, Dark Funeral and Grave over the years) and Jörgen Sandström (previously of Vicious Art, Krux, Entombed, Grave, Torture Division and live bassist/guitarist for Candlemass, Misery Loves Co, Kongh, to name a few).\nTPH recorded a three-song demo in the end of 1998, produced by famous producer Dan Swanö and featuring backing vocals by Entombed A.D. vocalist Lars-Göran Petrov. The demo was sent out to four labels and in 1999 they signed with the Germany-based Massacre Records, making 1999 the official starting year as things took off from there.\nIn 1998, the band recorded a Philipson-conceived project, Deadmarch: Initiation of Blasphemy, but the album initially never saw the light of day. It has since been mastered by Dan Swanö and was released on Vic Records 30 November 2009, with new album artwork and booklet.\nBy the end of 1999, The Project Hate recorded their debut album, Cybersonic Superchrist, which was released in the year 2000. During the recording, female singer Mia Ståhl joined the band. Although reviews were positive, the album was not a commercial success since it was not distributed widely.\nThe following year, the band recorded their second album, When We Are Done, Your Flesh Will Be Ours, in the late Nasum frontman Mieszko Talarczyk's Soundlab Studios. It was released in 2001, but like the first album, was only with difficulty available in stores.\nIn 2002, Petter S. Freed of 2 Ton Predator joined as a touring guitarist, then as a permanent member; Mia Ståhl was fired and replaced with Jonna Enckell; later that year, the band left Massacre Records and signed with Threeman Recordings. A live album was recorded in Helsinki, Finland, titled Killing Hellsinki, which was released in April 2003. Afterwards, the band went back to Soundlab Studios and Mieszko Talarczyk to record Hate, Dominate, Congregate, Eliminate.\nIn early 2005, the band began recording their fourth studio album, Armageddon March Eternal - Symphonies of Slit Wrists, with Dan Swanö. Michael Håkansson of Evergrey joined the band as a bassist during the recording, and later joined the band full-time. Armageddon March Eternal was released by Threeman Recordings in October 2005.\nIn 2006, the band left their record label and eventually signed with Peter Stormare's record label, StormVox. The band added drummer Daniel Moilanen for their upcoming album, to have live drums for the first time since the band's creation. The fifth studio album, In Hora Mortis Nostræ, was released September 2007. Distribution deals were being sorted in the remainder of 2007 to get the album out as widely as possible, with little success.\nIn July 2009, the band released its sixth full-length studio album The Lustrate Process on Vic Records.\n2010 brought about a change within the band as Jo Enckell was relieved from her duties as vocalist, being replaced by ex-Witchbreed's Ruby Roque. Bassist, Michael Håkansson was announced as being no longer a part of the band following his absence from the band's previous album 'The Lustrate Process'. The bass from that point has been taken care of by Lord K Philipson. A third member, drummer Thomas Ohlsson was replaced by ex-Vomitory/Torture Division drummer Tobias 'Tobben' Gustafsson.\n2014 brought another set of changes to The Project Hate. It was announced that Ruby Roque was relieved from duties, and renowned drummer Dirk Verbeuren would be taking up the drums. The name of the new female singer is Ellinor Asp.\nApart from Philipson, there are no longer any fixed members in the band (only Jörgen Sandström has been there since the beginning with Philipson), but a wide array of musicians are brought in for each recording to help realize Philipson's vision for TPH.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current musicians ===\nLord K Philipson – guitar, bass, keyboards, programming, backing vocals (1998–present)\nJörgen Sandström – vocals (1998–present)\nEllinor Asp – female vocals (2014–present)\nDirk Verbeuren – drums (2014–present)\nLasse Johansson – guitar solos (2014–present)\n\n\n=== Former musicians ===\nMia Ståhl – female vocals (1999–2002)\nJo Enckell – female vocals (2002–2010)\nRuby Roque – female vocals (2010–2013)\nPetter S.

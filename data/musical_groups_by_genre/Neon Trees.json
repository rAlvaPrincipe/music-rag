    "text": "Neon Trees are an American rock band from Provo, Utah. The band received nationwide exposure in late 2008 when they opened several North American tour dates for the band the Killers. Not long after, the band was signed by Mercury Records. Their first single, \"Animal\", climbed to No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Alternative Songs chart.\nSince their formation, Neon Trees has released five studio albums: Habits (2010), Picture Show (2012), Pop Psychology (2014), I Can Feel You Forgetting Me (2020), and Sink Your Teeth (2024). The band has also released eight EPs (two exclusive to iTunes) and fourteen singles.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed initially by childhood friends Tyler Glenn (vocals, keyboards) and Chris Allen (guitar, vocals) who both grew up in Murrieta, California, the band made its first home in Provo after Glenn and Allen moved there from Southern California, eventually adding Branden Campbell (bass guitar, vocals) and Elaine Bradley (drums, percussion, vocals) to the lineup. David Charles also plays with the band as touring guitarist.\nThey first started playing under the name Neon Trees in late 2005 with five original members, Tyler Glenn and Chris Allen from California, and three veterans of the Utah music scene, bass player Mike Liechty, drummer Jason Gibbons and keyboardist Nathan Evans. The band's name originates from the lighted trees on the In-N-Out Burger signs, which inspired Tyler Glenn. In a strange coincidence, it was later learned that Branden Campbell's father, Steve Campbell, installed the exact Neon Trees in the In-N-Out that inspired Glenn while working for a sign company out of Las Vegas.\nThey released an EP, Becoming Different People, in 2006 during the time of their first tour through California. The EP featured promising songs like \"Phones\", \"Sister Stereo\", \"Up Against the Glass\". They also recorded other unreleased tracks during the \"Treehouse Sessions\" in 2006.\nThe band's lineup soon narrowed down to four members with Branden Campbell and Elaine Bradley joining the group on bass and drums, respectively. Touring musician Bruce Rubenson on keyboards and drums joined in. Shortly thereafter, The Killers' drummer, Ronnie Vannucci Jr., went to watch the band play at a small club in Las Vegas as he had been in a Ska band called \"Attaboy Skip\" with Neon Trees bassist Branden Campbell prior to joining The Killers. Ronnie was impressed, and as a result they were chosen to open for The Killers for a string of dates on their 2008 North American tour. Vannucci later helped the band sign to major label Mercury Records, which was announced in late 2008. Additionally, the group was voted Band of the Year in 2009 by City Weekly, a popular Salt Lake City publication.\n\n\n=== 2010–11: Habits and commercial breakthrough ===\n\nAlthough they had several prior independent releases, the band released its debut album on Mercury/Island Def Jam, Habits, on March 16, 2010. \"Animal\" was chosen as the lead single and was shortly thereafter featured as the Free Single of the Week on iTunes in March 2010. They performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on March 23, 2010, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on May 14, 2010, Lopez Tonight on October 18, 2010, Live! with Regis & Kelly on November 4, 2010, and TBS' Conan on November 24, 2010.

They performed third single \"Your Surrender\" on Late Show with David Letterman on May 5, 2011 and a third appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on Jun 10, 2011. Mark Hoppus of Blink-182 selected \"Animal\" as his Spin magazine Pick of the Week. The song has also been featured on a commercial for Las Vegas. The group has also released a digital EP of four remixes of the song, one of which by Tyler Glenn.\nIn 2010, the band covered Justin Bieber's song \"Baby\" as well as Ben E. King's \"Stand By Me\". Throughout early 2010 the band, along with Mutemath and Street Drum Corps, opened for the Thirty Seconds to Mars tour Into the Wild. Subsequently, they headlined the Bang the Gong Tour with Paper Tongues, MeTalkPretty, and Civil Twilight in mid-2010, performed a set to 7,000 at Lollapalooza, and went on tour with Thirty Seconds to Mars in the last half of the year.\nIn November 2010, the band released a Christmas single called \"Wish List\". It was available for free on iTunes the first week it was released. In November 2010, Tyler and Elaine appeared as Neon Trees on Daryl Hall's monthly Internet concert series Live from Daryl's House. They performed four songs from Habits, including \"Animal\" and \"1983\", as well as the Fleetwood Mac hit \"Dreams\" and Hall & Oates songs \"Head Above Water\" and \"Adult Education.\"\nNeon Trees released a live album, iTunes Live from SoHo, in November 2010 featuring eight live tracks: \"Calling My Name\", \"Animal\", \"Your Surrender\", \"Never Tear Us Apart\", \"In the Next Room\", \"1983\", \"Love and Affection\", and \"Sins of My Youth\".\nFrom March 31, 2011, to April 23, 2011, they also opened for My Chemical Romance during the North American leg of their World Contamination Tour. They opened a show for Panic! at the Disco in Central Park in September 2011.

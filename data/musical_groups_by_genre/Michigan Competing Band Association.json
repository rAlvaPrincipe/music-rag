    "text": "The Michigan Competing Band Association (MCBA) is a sanctioning body for high school marching band field contests in the state of Michigan, established in 1974. Not only does it host a great number of local competitions around the state, MCBA holds the only statewide marching band championships in Michigan. Previous championships were held at Roundhouse Stadium in Durand, Michigan, the Plymouth-Canton Educational Park Varsity Stadium in Canton, Michigan, Rynearson Stadium at Eastern Michigan University, and at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. They are currently held at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. Prior to the 1992–93 school year, MCBA was known as the Michigan Competing Band Director's Association, or MCBDA.\n\n\n== Classification and scoring ==\nBands are separated into \"Flights\" by the number of students enrolled in the high school itself (based on MHSAA second semester totals) and are not a measurement of band or program size.  This has been in place since the 1992–93 school year.\nIn late July 2020, the MCBA announced the cancellation of the 2020 Marching Competitive Season.\nOn June 7, 2021, the MCBA announced its 2021 Competitive season and its schedule.\nThe flight sizes for the 2023 season are as follows:\n\nFlight I:  More than 1665\nFlight II:  1179–1665\nFlight III:  851–1178\nFlight IV:  662–850\nFlight V: Less than 662\nBands are judged completely separately in their respective flights. Bands are given a score, placement, as well as caption awards for \"Outstanding Music Performance\", \"Outstanding Visual Performance\", and \"Outstanding General Effect\" in their respective flights. The judging system is as follows:\nField\n\nVisual Field Judge Able to move around the field\nMusic Field Judge Able to move around the field\nEach judge awards a maximum of 12.5 points, for a maximum total of 25 points.\nEnsemble\n\nVisual Ensemble Judge Judges from press box or high vantage point in the stands\nMusic Ensemble Judge Judges from press box or high vantage point in the stands\nEach judge awards a maximum of 15 points, for a maximum total of 30 points.\nGeneral Effect\n\nGeneral Effect Music Judge 1\nGeneral Effect Music Judge 2\nGeneral Effect Visual Judge\nAll G.E. judges view from the press box. Each General Effect judge awards a maximum of 15 points, for a maximum total of 45 points\nThe scoring for each band is as follows:\nMCBA currently utilizes the Bands of America judging system in combination with several MCBA constructed judging sheets and criteria. Seven adjudicators are utilized in the scoring system:\n\nGeneral Effect Music Judge 1  15 pts\nGeneral Effect Music Judge 2  15 pts\nGeneral Effect Visual Judge  15 pts\nMusic Field Judge  12.5 pts\nMusic Ensemble Judge  15 pts\nVisual Field Judge  12.5 pts\nVisual Ensemble Judge 15 pts\nTotal possible =  100 pts\n\n\n== Previous champions ==\n2023\n\nFlight I: Rockford (88.050)\nFlight II:

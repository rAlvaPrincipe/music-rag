    "text": "Chimera (also known as Deputat Baltiki) was a Russian underground rock band formed by singer/guitarist Edward Starkov and lead-guitarist Gennady Bachinsky in St. Petersburg in 1990. It was the main group of the club Tamtam, in which Korol i Shut and Tequilajazzz also performed. Chimera repeatedly gave concerts in Germany.\nIn February 1997, at the age of 27, Starkov hanged himself in the attic of Chimera's rehearsal space. The group disbanded after Starkov's death.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nChimera's songs have been covered by artists and bands such as Psychea, Pilot, Iva Nova, Zakhar May, and PTVP. Alexei Nikonov of PTVP said: \"Chimera is the best thing about Russian rock 'n' roll. I am completely sure: throughout the 1990s in music, only two new words were spoken: in the States there was Nirvana, and in Russia — Chimera\".\nChimera's influences include Bauhaus, Nico, Butthole Surfers, Sonic Youth, Fugazi, Daniil Kharms, Jules Verne, Helena Blavatsky, and Philip K. Dick.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1991 Redt Starkov & Co (Russian: Рэдт Старков и компания)\n1991 Half-Petrograd Acoustics (Полупетроградская акустика)\n1991 Nautiluses (Кораблики)\n1991 Stoker Dreams (Сны кочегара)\n1991 Commissioner of Smoke Gendarmerie (Комиссар дымовой жандармерии)\n1992 Visionaries (Фантазёры)\n1993 Chimera (Химера)\n1994 Electric Train (Электричка)\n1994 Kalevala (Калевала)\n1995 Nuihuli\n1997 It's Me (Это я)\n1997 ZUDWA\n\n\n== Members ==\nEdward Starkov (\"Redt\") - lead singer, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, accordion, wind instrument\nGennady Bachinsky - guitar, producer\nUrij Lebedev - bass guitar\nVladislav Viktorov (\"Vitus\") - drums\nPaul Labutin - cello\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nАксютина О.

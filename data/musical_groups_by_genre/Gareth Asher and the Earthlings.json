    "text": "Gareth Asher and the Earthlings are an Atlanta, Georgia-based country and folk rock band formed by Georgia-born singer-songwriter and guitarist Gareth Asher in 2011, initially under the name Gareth Asher and the Infantry. Asher is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist and son of musical parents. After releasing a solo CD in 2004 and teaming with vocalist Joshua Huff in the band Illbreak in 2005 to release a CD, followed by an album under his own name 2007, Asher assembled what was to become the Earthlings and recorded his best-selling album to date in 2010. Using revenues from a successful Kickstarter project concluded June, 2011, Gareth and the Earthlings toured venues throughout the Southeastern United States in 2011.\nThe first public appearance of the band under the name Gareth Asher and the Earthlings was at The Park Tavern in Piedmont Park, Atlanta, Georgia, on June 16, 2012.\nGareth Asher and the Earthlings have appeared at venues throughout Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. Asher was named Musician of the Year at the Atlanta Chozen Awards in 2010. The band's music and lyrics are written by Gareth Asher, although they frequently cover other artists in the Southern Soul genre.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nAsher is notably terse in comments about his personal life. For examples, see his Str8tshootermusic and Atlanta Music Guide. However, in an interview with When We Speak TV he discusses his musical influences and interests.\nIn this interview, Asher credits his interest in music to having grown up in an atmosphere of rock and funk music -- Jackson Browne in particular. He credits the honing of his vocal talents to Jan Smith, coach for Rob Thomas of [Matchbox 20] and [Usher]. The Earthlings' style, identified as Southern Soul, has been connected with outstanding examples of that genre. Asher readily expresses his admiration for the pop/rock tradition connected with other Georgia natives Ray Charles and James Brown.\nIn comments likening Asher's voice to that of famed tenors such as Jeff Buckley, Ray Lamontagne, and even Cat Stevens, record and session producer Charlie Peacock describes Gareth Asher and the Earthlings as \"solid in all the ways we need a decidedly American singer-songwriter to be.  What do you get?  To begin with there’s loopy grooves, big wide tambourines, and a by- the-book folky, rock mix.  All the usual Americana instruments are up front and in the shadows: Acoustic guitars, B3, Wurlitzer electric piano, drums, bass, and electrics.\" Peacock adds \"I like this.  Good job.  But that doesn’t matter much.  What I hear is that the femmes really like them some Gareth.  Who needs one reviewer in your court when you’ve got 3.5 Billion females on your side?  Carry on Gareth.  Carry on.\"\n\n\n== Performances Gareth Asher songs ==\nAsher's song “Back to Myself” was featured on a Crazy 8 Promotions’ compilation release (February 2002) of eight different artists, primarily from the Atlanta area.\nGareth Asher was also selected to perform in the 2002, 2003, and 2004 Atlantis Music Conference.\nAs part of a tour financed by a successful Kickstarter project, Gareth Asher and the Earthlings played across the United States and massively expanded his fan base. As a gift to his contributors, the band gave a song to those who donated.\nAt the 2009 Hotel Carolina event, held September 25 and 26, Asher played on Saturday night alongside performers Matt Duke, Jay Nash, Sarah Haze, Tony Lucca, Benjy Davis Project and Tyrone Wells.\nPerformance of Get it right, a collaboration with alternative Southern rap quartet Nappy Roots in 2011 for a combination of Southern Soul and hip-hop as a call for social change posted on the GetItRight site and YouTube.\nEight of the tracks from Between the Smiles and the Tears are used in the soundtrack for Painting in the Rain, a 2011 movie produced and directed by independent film-maker Shayde Christian.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== No Reality ===\nReleased 2004 by Gareth Asher and the Infantry.

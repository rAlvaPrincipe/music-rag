    "text": "Steps are a British dance-pop group consisting of Lee Latchford-Evans, Claire Richards, Lisa Scott-Lee, Faye Tozer and Ian \"H\" Watkins. They were formed in May 1997 and achieved two number-one albums in the UK, 14 consecutive UK top-5 singles including two number ones (one a double A-side). The group has sold over 22 million records worldwide, 15 million albums worldwide. In-addition to earning a BRIT Award nomination in 1999, for Best Newcomer, the group would be an opening support act for Britney Spears on her debut American tour the same year. When Richards and Watkins departed to form a recording duo, the group disbanded, on 26 December 2001 (officially). Their penultimate single reached No. 5 on the UK charts, while their final album of greatest hits, Gold (2001), was the group's second No. 1 album in the UK.\nSteps re-formed in May 2011 for a four-part Sky Living documentary series titled Steps: Reunion. The series started airing on 28 September, following an announcement of a second greatest-hits album, The Ultimate Collection, released on 10 October 2011. The album debuted at No. 1, becoming the band's third album to top the British charts. The second series of Steps: Reunion, titled \"Steps: On the Road Again\", aired on Sky Living in April 2012; the series followed the band as they embarked on their sellout, 22-date UK tour. On 24 September 2012, the group confirmed they would release their fourth studio album, Light Up The World, on 12 November 2012, alongside a six-date Christmas tour, starting on 30 November and ending on 5 December. The group re-formed for a second time on 1 January 2017 in celebration of their 20th anniversary, and later announced their fifth studio album, Tears on the Dancefloor, which was released in April 2017.\nSteps' sixth studio album, What the Future Holds, was released on 27 November 2020. It was preceded by three singles, the title song \"What the Future Holds\", \"Something in Your Eyes\" and \"To the Beat of My Heart\". Their seventh studio album, What the Future Holds Pt. 2, with 10 new tracks, four stripped-back versions of songs and a new sound for some tracks, was released in 2021. The band's third compilation album, Platinum Collection was released in August 2022, and debuted at number 1 in the UK, making Steps the first British, mixed-gender group to achieve four number 1 albums in four different decades.\nAccording to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Steps has been certified for sales of 5 million albums and 4.8 million singles in the UK.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1997–1999: Formation, commercial success and Step One ===\nSteps were formed by Steve Crosby and Barry Upton (writers of \"5,6,7,8\") alongside manager Tim Byrne after auditioning hopefuls who answered an ad in The Stage newspaper. Byrne had previously been involved in the production of the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party, the BBC collaboration with the pop magazine Smash Hits.\nAfter auditions, the original line-up of Watkins, Scott-Lee, Derek O'Brien, Maddy Chan, and Mitch Stevens was finalised and the band started shooting promotional images and recording tracks. However, O'Brien, Chan and Stevens left, as they wanted more than a one-hit wonder, and saw no long-term future with Steps. New auditions were held on 7 May 1997, and in conjunction with the manufacturers, they selected Faye Tozer, Lee Latchford-Evans and Claire Richards as the remaining members.\nThe group's name came from a marketing plan: The dance steps for each of the quintet's choreographed music videos would be included with their singles.\nTheir first single \"5,6,7,8\" was a techno line dance song. Though not typical of what became their style, it was their first hit both in the UK and internationally. Despite only peaking at number 14, the single achieved considerable longevity in the fast-paced singles climate of 1997–1998, racking up over four months on the UK chart. The track remains one of the highest-selling singles never to reach the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Its release in Australia gave the group their first number one in 1998.\nTim Byrne then founded a management and production company, Byrne Blood, with former BMG head of marketing and video, Victoria Blood, which took over sole management of Steps and was also instrumental in the creation and management of A1.\nThe group were then presented to pop impresario, Pete Waterman who signed them to his Eastern Block Unity Label (EBUL) in a partnership with his long time associates, Jive Records. Waterman and his new PWL production partners, Mark Topham and Karl Twigg, reworked the \"5,6,7,8\" demo, introducing the prominent fiddle into the arrangement. Waterman stated that whilst he was pleased with the final mix of \"5,6,7,8\", his co-producers were less so, to the extent that on the single liner notes they did not take a credit, although they were credited on all subsequent releases, such as the Step One album. In April 1998, Steps launched their second single, a cover version of Bananarama's \"Last Thing on My Mind\", which became their first UK top ten, peaking at number 6.\nBy August 1998, Steps continued to build momentum with their third single \"One for Sorrow\" which peaked at number 2, and began an unbroken chain of 14 consecutive Top 5 hits on the UK singles chart. Steps' singles success translated into album sales, with their debut album Step One entering the UK Albums Chart at number 2. It was certified 5× Platinum following a run of 50 weeks in the Top 20.\nThe next single release was a double A-side which provided Steps with their signature song and biggest career seller. The single was a cover version of the Bee Gees' \"Tragedy\" and original track \"Heartbeat\". The single was released in November 1998, when it charted at number 2. Following enduring popularity over the Christmas period, the single rebounded up the chart and became their first number-one hit in January 1999. The final track to be released from Step One was \"Better Best Forgotten\". Because of the continued success of the previous single, the CD release was delayed by nearly two months. Nonetheless, \"Better Best Forgotten\" entered the chart at number 2.\nSteps were part of the ensemble that released \"Thank ABBA for the Music\" (a medley of ABBA's \"Take a Chance on Me\", \"Dancing Queen\", \"Mamma Mia\" and \"Thank You for the Music\") in March 1999, as performed at the BRIT Awards 1999. The other artists singing were Tina Cousins, Cleopatra, B*Witched, and Billie, known collectively as the Supertroupers. The single later peaked at number four. The group was also nominated for Best British Newcomer. Pete Waterman claimed to have been told days before the ceremony that Steps had won the award, as voted for by listeners of BBC Radio 1. However, on the night the award was handed to the Scottish band Belle & Sebastian, who were assumed to be rank outsiders. Despite the allegation that a significant number of votes for Belle & Sebastian were traced to the University of Strathclyde campus, the band held onto their award as foul play was denied by organizers of the BRIT Awards.\n\n\n=== 1999–2000: Steptacular, International tour and Buzz ===\nIn July 1999, Steps released the first single from an all-new album, \"Love's Got a Hold on My Heart\". Once again they narrowly missed the number-one spot following a last-minute surge by Ricky Martin's \"Livin' la Vida Loca\". After the single's release, Steps went to America to support Britney Spears on her 1999 ...Baby One More Time Tour. A remixed version of \"One for Sorrow\" was included in the film Drive Me Crazy and released as their debut American single. They were also successful in Europe and Australasia.\nSteps returned home to release their second album, Steptacular, which was accompanied by \"After the Love Has Gone\". The album charted at number 1 and was eventually certified 4× Platinum, thus becoming their second UK million selling album. The group subsequently released an album in North America which was titled Step One and was an amalgamation of their first two albums. The group's next two singles, \"Say You'll Be Mine/Better the Devil You Know\" and \"Deeper Shade of Blue\" (originally recorded by labelmate Tina Cousins for her debut album), both continued their top-five run.\nIn February 2000, Disney Channel aired a concert special featuring Steps and another group, Youngstown, titled Steps and Youngstown in Concert. The concert itself promoted the group and the sales of the album.\nIn July 2000, Steps released another double A-side, consisting of the Steptacular track \"When I Said Goodbye\" and an entirely new song, \"Summer of Love\". The latter was a Latino-flavoured pop song, which later appeared on their third album. Steps also won Best Selling Live Act of the year at the BRIT Awards 2000.\nIn October 2000, \"Stomp\" became their second number one single. The third album, Buzz, followed shortly and whilst it was less successful than their first two albums, went on to achieve double platinum status and contains five UK Top 5 singles. The group worked with many American and Swedish producers who had created hits for other Jive artists such as Britney Spears, 'N Sync, and the Backstreet Boys. The following single, \"It's the Way You Make Me Feel\", reached number 2 upon its January 2001 release. Steps promoted Buzz worldwide and did not return to the UK until May, when they released \"Here and Now / You'll Be Sorry\".\n\n\n=== 2000–2002: Gold, group tensions, Watkins' and Richards' departure, and split ===\nSplit rumours started circulating after it was announced that Steps would release a greatest hits album. The group continuously denied this in their interviews. \"Chain Reaction\", a cover of the popular Diana Ross song, was released as the first new single from Gold: Greatest Hits. The single became their biggest in almost two years. The second single, \"Words Are Not Enough/I Know Him So Well\", was another top five hit. It would become their final single as a group until their re-formation in 2012.\nIn 2001, following their Boxing Day split, the group were heavily criticised by their fans. Many UK tabloid papers published the fans' disgust on their front pages, displaying quotes taken from Steps message boards. After the group spent much of 2001 strongly dismissing claims of a split, fans were furious and accused the group of capitalising on the success of a host of merchandise released in the lucrative pre-Christmas market. However, it has since come to light that both Watkins and Richards left the group on the last night of the Steps' Gold: Greatest Hits tour, because of their ongoing unhappiness within the group, although Steps' official statement stated that the split was caused by their belief that they should end on a high, while they were at their best and could be remembered for being the best of their kind. H and Claire went on to form a duo in 2002 and signed to Warner Music for a reputed £5 million (over five albums), although they only released one album, Another You Another Me same year, before being dropped due to poor album sales.\n\n\n=== 2002–2010: The Last Dance, Reissue of Steps Classics and solo careers ===\nJive released a remix and B-side compilation in 2002. The Last Dance featured previously released remixes, B-sides and rarities. The album charted at number 57 without any promotion. A planned release for the track \"Baby Don't Dance\" was scrapped in November 2002. However, promotional copies were pressed and a video based upon their live Gold Tour briefly aired on MTV. In the same year, Tozer released her first single , \"Someone Like You\", a duet with Russell Watson, which was in the top-10 singles UK 2002. Scott-Lee released \"Lately\" on 12 May 2003 by Fontana Records and the song was written by Scott-Lee and Point4. The single peaked at number six on the UK Singles Chart, reached number 24 on the Irish Singles Chart, and also charted in the Netherlands and Switzerland. To date, it is Scott-Lee's only single to reach the top 10 in the United Kingdom. After then, she released another two singles same year and in 2005 but they didn't chart in the top 10 UK. In 2007, BMG reissued a collection of the band's first two albums as a 10-year anniversary of the band. Same year, Scott-Lee released her debut album, \"Never or Now\". Richards performed \"Tragedy\" on ITV1 special Everybody Dance Now in 2008. This was also Richards' first public appearance in six years. Watkins played the role of Silly Billy in pantomime Jack and the Beanstalk at the Southport Theatre from 10 December 2009 to 3 January 2010. Christmas 2010 saw his return to Grimsby as he performed in the pantomime Beauty and the Beast, playing the part of Muddles.\n\n\n=== 2011–2012: Reunion, The Ultimate Collection and touring ===\nSince the band's break-up, rumours had been circulating that they would reunite in one form or another. In 2009, Lee Latchford-Evans revealed that the band had been approached to perform a series of concerts. He hinted that a future reunion was possible, but said \"it isn't the right time right now\".\nIn early 2011, rumours began circulating that Steps would reunite for a TV series and a one-off concert to mark the tenth anniversary of their 2001 split. The reunion was denied by band's members, including Richards on her Twitter page. Richards also announced on 9 July 2011, that a Steps reunion would be \"silly\", but she would \"never say never\". Contrary to these claims, just 12 days later, it was announced that Steps would be reuniting for a four-part Sky Living documentary, depicting their split and the interim years. The band would also release their greatest hits album The Ultimate Collection, as well as potential new material.\nIn a promo for the show each member revealed their true feelings, with Watkins sharing that he regrets the way it all ended but insisting: \"If I were to revisit it and turn the clock back, I would probably have done it exactly the same way.\" Evans commented: \"They took something away from three people that we loved and we didn't get a choice because certain people took that choice away from us and I think that is very unfair.\" Steps: Reunion premiered on Sky Living at 9pm on Wednesday, 28 September.\nSteps said in a 2011 interview with Digital Spy that they believed there was a gap in the market for their brand of \"happy pop\". Scott-Lee said: \"Times have changed, but we are in a recession and Steps' music was very light-hearted and fun, so there could be a place for that in today's society,\" \"What else is interesting is that there aren't any boy/girl pop groups out there at the moment, so there's definitely a gap there.\"\nIn the first episode, the group opened up about the tension in the band, with Scott-Lee saying \"problems first arose when Watkins started flying in Britney Spears' private jet while the rest of them travelled by bus.\" Before, Richards stated \"Further cracks appeared when I discovered that H had been secretly dating the band's manager Tim Byrne.\" The second episode focused on the band talking about their reasons for the breakdown of communication and friendships in the group and also documented the first time they had all been together in the same room for over a year. The female members then flew to Marbella, Spain to bond whilst the male members went to Wales. The fourth episode showed Steps discussing the possible future of the band.\nSteps' newly recorded and produced version of \"Dancing Queen\" (not to be confused with the 1999 version) was added to the track list for The Ultimate Collection.\nOn 10 October 2011, Steps appeared for the first time on This Morning, performing \"It's the Way You Make Me Feel\" and \"Tragedy\" and announced their 14-date 2012 arena tour entitled The Ultimate Tour. They also announced that they had re-formed as a band full term. On 14 October 2011, Steps appeared on Lorraine and sang \"Deeper Shade of Blue\", which they also sang during an appearance on Loose Women on 24 October 2011. They then announced they had added 6 performances and removed 2 from the tour, bringing the total to 18 dates; they also announced a new date at the Summer Saturdays at Newmarket Racecourse on 25 August 2012. On 16 October 2011, their new album The Ultimate Collection went to number one in the UK Albums Chart. Steps performed a medley of their singles, including \"Deeper Shade of Blue\" and \"One for Sorrow\", on 19 November for Children in Need. They also appeared on Alan Carr: Chatty Man on 25 December 2011 and performed a medley of \"One for Sorrow\", \"Deeper Shade of Blue\" and \"Tragedy\". A DVD of the Reunion tour entitled Steps – The Ultimate Tour Live was released on Monday 29 October 2012. It charted at number one on the Official Charts Company's Music Video Chart on 4 November 2012.\n\n\n=== 2012–2016: Light Up the World and hiatus ===\n\nIt was announced that the group would release their own fragrance called Guilty Pleasure in a disco ball-styled bottle. It was put out to stores on 1 November 2012. They also brought out an official calendar for 2013. It was released on 15 October 2012. On 13 October 2012, Steps without Watkins appeared on BBC Radio 2 with Graham Norton. Their new single \"Light Up the World\" aired for the very first time. They announced that it would be released on 22 October 2012.\nFollowing their sell-out arena tour, the group performed a number of summer shows and public appearances. At the end of June, Tozer confirmed on Twitter that there would be more from the group after their summer shows. In August, Watkins posted a picture on Twitter confirming the group were in the studio recording. In September, it was confirmed that a new album, titled Light Up the World, would be released by the end of the year, consisting of Christmas songs. On 12 November 2012, Steps released Light Up the World, their fourth studio album, which consisted of Christmas songs. The lead single from the album, \"Light Up the World\", was released on 22 October 2012. The group also embarked on a six-date Christmas tour entitled Christmas with Steps in November 2012 through December 2012. In an interview with Metro, Watkins confirmed that there could be two new fragrances for 2013, following the success of Guilty Pleasure. In an interview with Digital Spy, Watkins also confirmed that he would like Rylan Clark to be a support act on their next tour. Tozer appeared on Loose Women in February 2013 and when asked about the future of the band she commented saying that they would soon be meeting and discussing what to do next. In March 2013, Watkins announced on Twitter that he and the rest of Steps were having a meeting.\nIn May 2013, it was announced that Steps were going to be taking a break due to heavily touring last year, confirming on several occasions, after some speculation, that they have not split up. During this hiatus they each pursued solo projects.\nTozer appeared in the worldwide premiere of the musical The Tailor Made Man from March to April and appeared in the musical Singin' in the Rain from December through to March. Watkins appeared in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat from June to October and in Jack and the Beanstalk in December. Latchford-Evans ran three marathons and took time out to manage his wife Kerry-Lucy Taylor's band Concrete Rose. Richards started her own fashion range for Fashion World, which she also modeled. In January 2014, Richards announced on Twitter that she had begun work on her first studio album. Her album, My Wildest Dreams, was released on 1 February 2019.\nA new compilation entitled 5,6,7,8: The Collection was released on 27 November 2015 through Music Club Deluxe containing most of the singles with some B-sides and remixes. This is a budget-release CD which has no official connection to Steps or any previous management or record company but a selection of tracks licensed to Music Club Deluxe for release. The album is available on CD and via download. On 1 April 2016, a three-disc compilation entitled Stomp All Night: The Remix Anthology was announced, featuring 36 of the group's remixes, 20 of which had never before been released in the UK. The release includes a brand new remix of \"Say You'll Be Mine\".\n\n\n=== 2017–2021: Tears on the Dancefloor and What the Future Holds Parts 1 & 2 ===\nThe group officially confirmed on 1 January 2017, that they were ending their five-year break following their reunion tour and Christmas album. The group performed at the I Love The 90's event in Hasselt, Belgium, due to the band's massive popularity in Belgium during the late 1990s.\nThe group's fifth studio album, Tears on the Dancefloor, was released on 21 April 2017 and entered the charts at number 2. On 5 March 2017, the group confirmed the release of the new album, alongside its lead single, \"Scared of the Dark\", and a 22-date tour, Party on the Dancefloor. A deluxe edition of the album, titled Tears on the Dancefloor: Crying at the Disco, was released on 27 October.\nIn November 2017, Tozer announced that the reunion was no longer just a 20th-anniversary celebration and that the group intends to continue after their 2018 Summer of Steps tour.

On the gala night of the musical, the group announced that the musical will tour the UK and Ireland from August 2025 until May 2026. On 23 February 2024, Steps reissued their first three studio albums, Step One, Steptacular and Buzz, on vinyl record for the first time ever.

She also stated that Steps will have a little rest before having a bigger comeback soon.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nSteps had their own talent show named Steps to the Stars, in which young people performed three acts to be judged by a public vote. It was revealed on the next show who would go through to the final. This was shown on CBBC in 2000/2001. Two series were aired, presented by H and Claire, although the group performed one of its classics at the end of each show. The show featured a young Danny Jones in a band called Y2K in which he played guitar with his sister and their friend, and the eventual winner was a female solo singer called Jenny-Lynn Smith.

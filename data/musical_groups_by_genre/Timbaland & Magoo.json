    "text": "Timbaland & Magoo were an American hip hop duo, composed of Virginia natives Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley (born March 10, 1972) and Melvin \"Magoo\" Barcliff (July 12, 1973 – August 13, 2023). Formed in 1989, the duo signed with Blackground Records, an imprint of Atlantic Records to release three studio albums: Welcome to Our World (1997), Indecent Proposal (2001), and Under Construction, Part II (2003). The latter's lukewarm commercial reception led Timbaland to focus on his solo career and production work, while Magoo failed to release any solo material. Magoo died of a heart attack in 2023.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHailing from Norfolk, Virginia, the duo first met when they were teenagers back in 1989 through their friend Larry Live. In 1990 Timbaland, Larry Live, and Magoo formed a group called Surrounded By Idiots. Later that year they recruited friend and future fellow group member Pharrell Williams. The group only lasted three years, due to Pharrell Williams leaving the group to pursue a career with his own group the Neptunes in the summer of 1991, and Larry Live left the group after they signed Swing Mob in 1993. In late 1992, the group was recruited by Fayze group members Radiah Covington, Chonita Coleman, and Missy Elliott to be part DeVante Swing's collective, Da Bassment Crew, which also included Playa, Tweet, Baazar Royale, Ginuwine, and Stevie J–who were each signed with Swing Mob. \nDuring the early days of Da Bassment Crew, after group member Larry Live had left S.B.I. After DeVante Swing had sent them for a while to quit their jobs in 1993, After Larry's departure Magoo suggested to Tim to form the duo Timbaland & Magoo. After guest appearing on fellow Swing Mob artists' releases, the duo decided left the label, following after Elliott, who did so due to low pay cuts and  chaotic working conditions. Timbaland & Magoo signed with Blackground Records in 1996, an imprint of Atlantic Records to release their debut album, Welcome to Our World in November 1997. It spawned the single \"Up Jumps da Boogie\", which peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains their highest-charting song. They released two further studio albums as a group, Indecent Proposal in 2001 and Under Construction, Part II in 2003. The latter was meant as a sequel to Missy Elliott's fourth album Under Construction. \nIn August 2021, Blackground Records, the label who launched R&B/Pop singer Aaliyah, signed a distribution deal with Empire Distribution to re-release Timbaland & Magoo's catalog on CD, cassette and vinyl, onto digital download sites and, for the first time ever, streaming services. As a result, Timbaland's 1998 LP Tim's Bio: Life from da Bassment and Timbaland & Magoo albums Welcome to Our World, Indecent Proposal and Under Construction, Part II were re-released August 27, 2021.\nMagoo died on August 13, 2023, at the age of 50, and his death was confirmed by his former wife, Meco Barcliff. His funeral service took place on September 6, 2023, in Portsmouth, Virginia.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\nS.B.I. - UH UH AH (1990)\nS.B.I. - It's Like That Yaw (1991)\nS.B.I. - SkullCaps (1991)\nS.B.I. - If Ur Freaky (1991)\nS.B.I. - Can U Get Wit It (1993)\nJodeci - In The Meanwhile (1994)\nJodeci – \"What About Us (Swing Mob Mix)\" (1994)\nSwing Mob - Plenty Of Styles 1994\nSwing Mob - \"Ain't Nothing But A B Party \" 1994\nSwing Mob - \" Dat Funk\" (1995)\nSwing Mob - \" Nothing But A B-Party Remix \" (1995)\nDeVante Swing - Gin & Juice (Remix) featuring Da Boogie Man, Mr. Brendal, Timbaland & Magoo, Black, Static & C-Dub (1995)\nS.B.I - Big White Spaceship (1995)\nGinuwine – \"G.

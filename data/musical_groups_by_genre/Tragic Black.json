    "text": "Tragic Black is an American deathrock band formed in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 2000 by musicians known as Vision and Vyle. It has incorporated elements of darkwave music into each of its albums. Lyrically, Tragic Black's themes for the songs deal with religion, political issues and spirituality.\n\n\n== History ==\nTragic Black most recently released video for \"Play For Today\", a cover by The Cure.  In April 2016, Tragic Black released their latest album \"NOSTALGIA\" on Danse Macabre Records in Germany.  NOSTALGIA was recorded at BASSLAB studio by Steven Comeau (of STARBASS) who recorded/mixed/mastered and did additional programming.  On NOSTALGIA, the line up returns to a three piece that the band had in their earlier years (featuring; Stich (singer of All Gone Dead) on Guitar, Vyle on Bass/Programming and vISION on vocals/programming).  The sound of Nostalgia is reminiscent of the bands roots in the Goth/Deathrock scene, as well as Industrial.  Nostalgia also featured the majority of the programming/songwriting by vISION.  NOSTALGIA also features remixes by; LARVA (Spanish industrial), Seputus Black (former TB drummer) and vISION.  In 2013, Tragic Black released an album titled \"The Eternal Now\", which featured a heavier sound compared to their previous works, although remaining a mixture of rock and electronic music the band had been known for.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nThe band cites Rozz Williams as one of the influences, having recorded cover versions of his songs and played at concerts dedicated to his memory. The other inspirations include David Bowie, Mötley Crüe, Bauhaus, Specimen and Skinny Puppy.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\nvISION – vocals, programming (2000–present)\nVyle –  bass guitar, keys, backing vocals (2000–present)\nBen 'Stich' – guitar, backing vocals (2004, 2010, 2014–present)\nFormer members\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nTragic Black on ReverbNation\nTragic Black on MySpace\nTragic Black on Facebook"

    "text": "The ensemble Alash is a throat singing band from Tuva, Russia, that performs traditional Tuvan music with some non-traditional influences.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe musicians of Alash are Bady-Dorzhu Ondar, Ayan-ool Sam, and Ayan Shirizhik. Originally called Changy-Xaya, the group was formed at Kyzyl Arts College in 1999 and  became the resident traditional ensemble. The outgrowth of this musical exploration is the ensemble Alash, which is named for the Alash River that flows through the musicians' home region of Tuva.  Since its inception, Alash has undergone several personnel changes.  In 2004, Alash won first prize at the International Xöömei (throat singing) Symposium competition. \nAlash toured the United States in 2006 at the invitation of the Open World Leadership Center at the Library of Congress with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts.  Their trip was organized by CEC ArtsLink, an organization that orchestrates cross-cultural arts exchanges and grants between the US and Central Europe, Russia, and Eurasia.\nAlash has toured the United States every year since, playing at a variety of venues.  They also conduct workshops at schools and colleges to share their music and culture with American young people. In December 2008, December 2009 and December 2010, Alash toured with the American group Béla Fleck and the Flecktones to promote the Flecktones' Grammy winning album Jingle All the Way, which features Alash as guest artists.  \nIn August 2007, the group performed for President Vladimir Putin while he was on holiday in Tuva.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nAlash Live at the Enchanted Garden March 2006\nAlash April 2007\nJingle All the Way September 2008.

    "text": "Arling & Cameron (sometimes 'A&C') are a Dutch electronic music duo, composed of Gerry Arling and Richard Cameron.\nTheir early music draws from French pop, spy movie themes, lounge, '70s light rock, Japanese Shibuya-kei and other music genres that are often associated with kitsch. Their beat-driven pop collages recalled Pizzicato Five or Cornelius, with whom they also collaborated. With Pizzicato Five they co-wrote the song \"Arigato, we love you\" on the P5 album 'Happy end of the world'. \nLater albums incorporated more modern pop and electro influences as well as rap and dance.\n\n\n== History ==\nTheir musical partnership began in 1994, inspired by the Shibuya-kei kitsch-pop deconstructionists that had emerged in Japan several years earlier. They held \"Easy Tune\" parties around Amsterdam that year; from those performances they culled singles which they released under a variety of pseudonyms (16 in all, including \"Popcorn\" and \"Aloha Sisters\") on Cameron's Drive-In/Easy Tune label. Collaborations with Pizzicato Five, Fantastic Plastic Machine, and Bebel Gilberto followed soon after. In 1998 label Emperor Norton released their Voulez Vous EP in the United States as well as their debut album, All-In, in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Arling & Cameron released Music for Imaginary Films, a collection of theme songs for nonexistent movies and TV shows. Working with Joost Swarte, the duo also released Sound Shopping during the same year, featuring French-inspired sample based songs, with the first track, Fun Shopping, featuring samples of cash registers and high heels. A year later, in April 2001, they released their third album, We Are A&C, a dance-pop record drawing stylistically from smooth R&B, psych, Krautrock and tropicalia-tinged lounge.\nBetween 2002 and 2010 they cooperated on soundtracks for several feature film projects Oesters van Nam Kee, Boys & Girls Guide To Getting Down, Phileine Says Sorry, Das Jahr der ersten KÃ¼sse and Hollywood Sex wars as well as games music for Sony PlayStation (Hot Shot Golf).\nIn 2006 they released Hi-Fi underground.\nTheir 2015 album release is GOOD TIMES. An eclectic mix of modern pop and electro and rap. Guest singers on the album include Princess Superstar, FERAL is KINKY, Faberyayo and Nina Hagen.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAll-In (1999)\nMusic For Imaginary Films (2000)\nSound Shopping (2000)\nWe are A & C (August 2001)\nHi-Fi Underground (September 2006)\nGood Times (April 2015)\n\n\n== References =="

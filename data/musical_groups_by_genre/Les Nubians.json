    "text": "Les Nubians is a French musical duo, composed of sisters Hélène and Célia Faussart from Paris, France. In 1985, the sisters moved with their parents to Chad. Seven years later, they returned to Bordeaux, France, and began singing a cappella, producing poetry slams in Bordeaux and Paris, and singing background vocals for various artists worldwide. The duo's debut album Princesses Nubiennes was released by Virgin Records, France, in 1998.\nThey have become one of the most successful French-language musical groups in the U.S., best known for their Billboard R&B Single \"Makeda\" from their Grammy nominated album Princesses Nubiennes. Les Nubians were the 1999 Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards winners for Best New Artist, Group or Duo and received two NAACP Image Awards nominations in 2000.\nIn May 2020, the sisters were featured in the Visual Collaborative Polaris catalog. In a series titled TwentyEightyFour released during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, their interview announced a music single LIBERATION. Rika Muranaka, Dakore Akande appeared in the same periodical. The duo executive-produced Echos, Chapter One in 2005 on their label Nubiatik; a joint venture with Triloka Records. The project features artists from France, and the U.S. performing poetry and music from the urban edge.

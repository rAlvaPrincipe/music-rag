    "text": "The Outlaws were an English instrumental band that recorded in the early 1960s. One-time members included Chas Hodges (1943–2018), Bobby Graham (1940–2009), Ritchie Blackmore (born 1945), Mick Underwood (1945-2024), Reg Hawkins (born 1942), Billy Kuy (born  1940), Don Groom (born 1939), Roger Mingaye (born 1942), Ken Lundgren and Harvey Hinsley (born 1948).\n\n\n== Career ==\nTheir name was originally conceived by Joe Meek (born Robert George Meek in 1929), who needed a backing group for Mike Berry's \"Set Me Free\" in 1960, after, according to Meek biographer, John Repsch, Meek had fired Berry's original backing group, The Statesmen. After that recording, they continued being one of the house bands of his recording studio at 304 Holloway Road, London. As such, they were used for recordings, demos and auditions. Many of their songs were written by Meek, and credited to  one or other of his pseudonyms, either Robert Duke or Peter Jacobs; the latter of which he used on The Outlaws' \"Shake with Me\".\nThey appeared as themselves in the 1963 British film, Live It Up!.\nIn addition to featuring as a backing band on recordings by Mike Berry (born Michael Hubert Bourne in 1942), including three hit singles, or backing Houston Wells, Gene Vincent, John Leyton, Geoff Goddard or Heinz, they also recorded singles in their own right. One of these, \"Bike Beat\", for Raleigh Bicycle Company, (see below), even had dance instructions created especially for it, printed on the picture sleeve, with bicycle references : \"Grab a girl at random, make like a tandem\".\nIn 1990, all of their 1960s singles were issued on The Outlaws Ride Again (the Singles A's and B's ), on the See For Miles Label.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nHarvey Hinsley would later join the group Hot Chocolate who would have hits with \"You Sexy Thing\" and \"Every 1's a Winner\". Chas Hodges was later in the duo Chas & Dave. Ritchie Blackmore became the most famous former member of The Outlaws, having a successful career as a member of Deep Purple and his Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nWith the line-up : Billy Kuy, Bobby Graham, Chas Hodges, Reg Hawkins\n\n\"Swingin' Low\" b/w \"Spring is Near\" (March 1961) – UK No. 46\n\"Ambush\" b/w \"Indian Brave\" (June 1961) – UK No. 43\n\"Valley of the Sioux\" b/w \"Crazy Drums\" (September 1961)\nWith the line-up : Ken Lundgren, Don Groom, Chas Hodges, Roger Mingaye\n\n\"Ku-Pow!\" b/w \"Last Stage West\" (February 1962)\n\"Sioux Serenade\" b/w \"Fort Knox\" (12 October 1962)\nWith the line-up : Mick Underwood, Ken Lundgren, Chas Hodges, Ritchie Blackmore\n\n\"Poppin' Medley Part 1\". b/w \"Poppin' Medley Part 2\".

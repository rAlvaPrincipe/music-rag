On August 27, 2012, Miami New Times uploaded a list of the 50 Best Miami Bands of All Time where ¡Mayday! was listed as #27. Along with their placement on the list, Miami New Times stated that \"¡Mayday! just might be Miami rap's future.\" On August 7, 2012, ¡Mayday! released their first EP under Strange Music, \"Thrift Store Halos\".\nOn July 16, 2013, Mayday released their fourth studio album Believers. They also featured on Tech N9ne's single \"Fragile\", along with Kendrick Lamar, which was released shortly after Believers. In 2013, the band went on tour with Tech N9ne during his Something Else Tour.\nIn 2014 on June 10, Members of ¡Mayday! teamed up with newly signed Strange Music artist Murs to bring together ¡Mursday!. Shortly after the release of ¡Mursday!, ¡Mayday! and Murs released a free EP on SoundCloud presented by Boost Mobile titled \"Ready 2 Run\".\nShortly before ¡Mayday! released their sixth studio album Future Vintage on September 18, 2015, Plex Luthor formally departed the group on good terms. After the album release, the group toured all around the country. Along with touring, rappers Bernz and Wrekonize have been releasing their solo albums.

On September 7, 2018, they released their next album called South of 5th.\n\n\n=== Departure from Strange Music, Mayday Music (2022–present) ===\nOn May 1, 2022, during the group’s performance at Red Rocks Park and Amphitheater of Tech N9ne’s Asin9ne tour, ¡Mayday! addressed to the rumors in regards about the group’s current status with Strange Music.

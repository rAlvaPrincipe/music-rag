    "text": "Trampled by Turtles is an American bluegrass-influenced folk band from Duluth, Minnesota. They have released ten full albums, three of which reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard bluegrass chart. Their fifth release, Palomino, stayed in the chart's Top 10 for 52 straight weeks. Their latest album, Alpenglow, was released on October 28, 2022.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nDave Simonett – guitar, lead vocals, harmonica (2003–present)\nTim Saxhaug – bass, backing vocals (2003–present)\nDave Carroll – banjo, backing vocals (2003–present)\nErik Berry – mandolin, backing vocals (2003–present)\nRyan Young – fiddle, backing vocals  (2007–present)\nEamonn McLain – cello, backing vocals (2014–present)\n\n\tTrampled by Turtles, live 2014\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Founding ==\nTrampled by Turtles' frontman, Dave Simonett, formed the band in 2003 as a side project. When Simonett's musical equipment was stolen in 2003, he was left with only an acoustic guitar. Simonett was restricted to genres such as bluegrass and folk—acoustic genres that did not rely on amplification. Simonett was a newcomer to the acoustic music scene, so he recruited other newcomers to the newly-formed band: fiddler Ryan Young (previously a drummer in a speed metal act), bassist Tim Saxhaug, mandolinist Erik Berry, and Dave Carroll on the banjo. They quickly adopted a distinctive sound, \"fast, frenetic, that owed as much to rock & roll as bluegrass\". \nThe band's name, \"Trampled by Turtles\", was suggested as a joke. Simonett explains in an interview that \"'We all brought our lists of names to rehearsal one time, and we agreed to decide on the name that we hated the least, and that one stuck'\". From the beginning, they've refused to limit themselves to a specific label or genre: \"'I don't really know what to say when I'm asked that. I hesitate to say bluegrass because I'm familiar with that kind of music. I feel that is a genre that has set boundaries that, and anytime you stray out of that, you're not really considered a bluegrass band no matter what instruments you're playing on. I would say it's Americana with string instruments, but whatever anyone wants to call it, that's fine'\".  \nTrampled by Turtles released 3 albums between 2004 and 2007: Songs from a Ghost Town (2004), Blue Sky and the Devil (2005), and Trouble (2007). However, their fourth album, Duluth, released in 2008, earned them recognition within the bluegrass community, with Duluth peaking at #8 on the Billboard bluegrass chart. Following this success, Trampled by Turtles were featured in several music festivals. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nThe band has performed at many national festivals including Coachella, Bonnaroo, Stagecoach, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, Bumbershoot, and Pickathon.

    "text": "High Rise was a Japanese noise rock band from Tokyo, formed in 1982. The core of the band has consisted of bassist Asahito Nanjo and guitarist Munehiro Narita. The group named themselves after the 1975 novel High Rise by J. G. Ballard. Their music draws from psychedelic music, free jazz and improvisational music.\n\n\n== History ==\nHigh Rise were originally performing under the name Psychedelic Speed Freaks and contained members Masashi Mitani, Asahito Nanjo, Munehiro Narita, and Ikuro Takahashi.

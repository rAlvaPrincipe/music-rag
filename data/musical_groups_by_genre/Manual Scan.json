They toured in the US, England (including a 1986 appearance at the 100 Club in London), and Mexico. The group's song \"Nothing Can Be Everything\" was included in the 1990 Columbia Pictures release, A Girl To Kill For.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe founding members of Manual Scan were guitarist / singer Bart Mendoza, guitarist Kevin Ring, bassist David Fleminger and drummer Paul Kaufman, though within a few months of the band's formation Kaufman was replaced by Paul Brewin and singer Yvonne Simon was added on backing vocals and guitar. All except for Fleminger were former students of La Jolla High School\n. The band's lineup changed frequently during its existence, with Mendoza and Donaker-Ring as the core members.

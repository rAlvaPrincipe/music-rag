    "text": "Curly Strings is an Estonian folk band which was established in 2013.\nCurly Strings is an acoustic four-piece band that draws its inspiration from their own personal heritage in the current Estonian cultural space. Intense and playful ensemble work paired with a sincere presentation of their original music forms the main basis of Curly Strings’ soundscape. The band’s rise in the Estonian music scene in 2013 was a phenomenon unlike any other: a folk music artist became mainstream by collecting national music awards and being the top seller in music stores for more than a year. They bring their unique Baltic take to the acoustic music world in combining the familiar with the unfamiliar, having catchy heartfelt songwriting side-by-side with folk music aesthetics, making them an exciting act to look out for.\n\n\n== Members ==\nEeva Talsi – fiddle, lead vocals\nTaavet Niller – upright bass, vocals\nPeeter Hirtentreu – guitar, vocals\nVillu Talsi – mandolin.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2014 \"Üle ilma\"\n2015 \"Elumäng\"\n2017 \"Hoolima\"\n2020 \"Sümfooniline Curly Strings\"\n2020 Curly Strings ja Sõbrad \"Lastele\"\n2021  \"Pidu meis eneses\" \n2021 \"Rahu meis eneses\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\nBand has won several awards: \n\nEstonian Folk Music Awards\nAlbum of the year 2015\nBand of the year 2015\nBest New Folk Artist 2017\nEstonian Ethno Music Awards\nBest New Folk Artist 2015.\nEuropean World of Bluegrass Awards\n\nEuropean Bluegrass Band 2016 \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

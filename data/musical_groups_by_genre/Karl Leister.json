    "text": "Karl Leister (born 15 June 1937) is a classical clarinet player from Wilhelmshaven, Germany. At a very young age, he learned to play the clarinet from his father, also a clarinetist, and later studied at the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin. As a teenager, he was accepted into the Komische Oper Berlin under Václav Neumann and Walter Felsenstein as clarinet soloist.\nIn 1959, Leister joined the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Herbert von Karajan; this musical association was to last for thirty years. During this time, he became internationally recognized as a soloist and chamber musician. He was also one of the founding members of the Bläser der Berliner Philharmoniker (\"Berlin Soloists\"), which made a number of recordings – including Brahms's \"Clarinet Quintet in B Minor, Opus 115\". Additionally, he co-founded the Ensemble Wien-Berlin.\nThe creation of the Herbert von Karajan Academy of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has permitted Leister to teach music to a whole new generation of musicians. From 1993 to 2002, Leister held the position of Professor at the Hochschule für Musik \"Hanns Eisler\" in Berlin.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"\"Das Glück ist immer weiter gewachsen\" Klarinettist Karl Leister spielte bei der Eröffnung\".

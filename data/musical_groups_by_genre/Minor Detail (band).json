    "text": "Minor Detail were an Irish new wave and synthpop band from Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMinor Detail was headed by brothers John and Willie Hughes. Their lyrical themes were positive and covered topics such as romance and peace. Their self-titled debut album was produced by Bill Whelan (later of Riverdance fame), and they became one of the first Irish bands to secure a recording contract with an American label. However, they were short-lived, splitting in 1984, but reunited for a brief period in 1986â€“87. In 1991, John Hughes would discover the Corr siblings during an audition for The Commitments and would soon become the Corrs' manager.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nMinor Detail (Polydor POLD 5113, UK 1983)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Canvas of Life\"/\"I'll Always Love You\" (Polydor, 1983) IRE #25, US #92\n\"Canvas of Life\"/\"Ask the Kids\" (Casablanca/Polystar, Japan 1983)\n\"Canvas of Life\"/\"Hold On\" (Polydor PRD 218?, US 1983)\n\"Canvas of Life\"/\"Hold On\"/\"Take It Again\" (Japan)\n\"Take It Again\"/\"Living in the 20th Century\" (Polydor POSP 679, 1983)\n\"She's Back\"/\"Wait\" (RCA MD1, IRL 1986)\n\n\n== References =="

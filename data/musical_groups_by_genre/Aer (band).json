    "text": "Aer was an indie US band consisting of David von Mering and Carter Schultz. The duo hail from Wayland, Massachusetts, a small town in the suburbs west of Boston. They first gained popularity with their debut studio album, The Bright Side in 2012, which reached #85 on the US Billboard 200. Their self-titled second album, Aer (2014), reached #26 a year and a half later. The album One Of A Kind was released on August 14, 2015.\n\n\n== Early years ==\n\n\n=== Mixtapes & What You Need EP (2010 â€“ 2011) ===\nVon Mering, who was born in Portland, Oregon and first grew up in Davis, California met Schultz in elementary school in their hometown of Wayland, Massachusetts. After their first band broke up in their junior year of high school, they created their own brand of music. Their first mixtape, Water On The Moon came out in 2010, followed by their second mixtape, The Reach in May 2011. The duo recorded their first EP, What You Need, later that year.\n\n\n=== The Bright Side (2012) ===\nAfter graduating from Wayland High School, the two moved to Boston and began to work full-time on their first full-length studio album, The Bright Side, which they released in the summer of 2012. The album reached #85 on the Billboard 200. and went Certified Gold. It was followed by their second EP, Strangers in 2013.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Self-Titled Album (2014) ===\nThe duo released their self-titled second album on January 21, 2014. The album reached #26 on the Billboard Chart.\n\n\n=== One of a Kind (2015) ===\nTheir third full-length album, One of a Kind was released on August 15, 2015, and the quickly went on tour. Among the first stops on the One Of A Kind Tour were the State Theater in Portland, Maine, Best Buy Theater in New York City, and the House of Blues in Boston. The Dutch band Chef'Special and Australian singer Cody Simpson were the openers. They also performed with Slightly Stoopid whose song \"Wiseman\" they covered. Their song \"Floats My Boat\" reached over 7 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n=== The End of Aer (2016) ===\nSchultz and Von Mering announced on social media that Aer would no longer be creating new music or performing together, adding that it was a mutual decision with no hard feelings between the two. Both have since started different lives with Schultz and von Mering still working on music but separately. Meanwhile, von Mering also has been seen creating art pieces from his Twitter/X. Schultz moved to Los Angeles as he was living in southern Maine during the COVID-19 pandemic at the time in a journey of self-discovery to pursue a solo career as \"Carter Reeves\" to find his own voice. During this time, he wrote his first solo EP and shopped it to Ineffable Records.\n\n\n== New project ==\nAs of 2020, Carter Reeves (Schultz) has started his own project/band called Surfer Girl. Reeves transitioned from his hip-hop days with Aer to form a laid-back, California-coastal style sound with surf guitar and good vibes. He combines his music with indie-pop, reggae, and surf-rock, as well as hip-hop elements. Surfer Girl has been on tour ever since (Reeves on guitar with a touring drummer and bassist), opening for reggae rock bands throughout the U.S. Surfer Girl's debut full-length studio album, \"Sunrise\", released on June 10, 2022.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n== References =="

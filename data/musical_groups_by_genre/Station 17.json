    "text": "Station 17 is a Hamburg-based experimental rock group which was founded in 1989. The collective started as both a creative and social project and was the first to connect musicians with and without disabilities in the alternative music scene in Germany. On their first album, released in 1989, the group collaborated with a number of artists such as Michael Rother, Holger Czukay and F.M. Einheit among others and they developed a unique experimental sound.\nIn the following decades the band released eight albums on several European labels such as Whats so funny about, Mute Rec and later on their own label 17 Rec. They toured clubs and played festivals throughout Europe including: Kilbi Festival, Hurricane Festival, Burgherzberg Festival, Schiphorst Avantgarde.\nTheir last two efforts, „Fieber“ (2011) and the political disco album „Alles für Alle“ (2014) focused strongly on their fundamental idea of inclusion (all members of the group are qualified in a similar way, regardless of their disabilities). The German Federal Agency for Civic Education presented their concept of inclusion and music to a wider audience by interviewing the group on their website.\nIn 2012 the German Federal President Joachim Gauck invited them to play at the \"Bürgerfest des Bundespräsidenten\" in Berlin.\nIn 2013 they won an award for their music video to \"Uh Uh Uh\" at the OSKA Bright Film Festival.\nThe sound spectrum of the group contains a mixture of electronic, krautrock, disco, noise and pop. Their ninth album is scheduled for spring 2018.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nStation 17 (1990)\nGenau So (1993)\nScheibe (1997)\nBravo (1999)\nHitparade - Remix Album (2001)\nMikroprofessor (2006)\nGoldstein Variationen (2008)\nGoldstein Variationen Remix (2011)\nFieber  (2011)\nAlles für Alle (2014)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nStation 17 / 不要表态 - Split (1993)\nNadine/Fahrstuhl - Remixes by Console & Remute (2006)\nDrogen Sind Schlecht Für Die Haut - Remixes by Pelle Buys & Lawrence (2007)\nGoldstein Variationen #01 - Station 17 + The Robocop Kraus + Barbara Morgenstern / Remixes by Mense Reents & Thomas Fehlmann (2007)\nGoldstein Variationen #02 - Station 17 + Von Spar + Melissa Logan / Remixes by Sid Le Rock & Cab Drivers (2008)\nGoldstein Variationen #03 - Station 17 + Schneider TM + Ted Gaier + Melissa Logan / Remixes by kptmichigan & Erobique (2008)\nGoldstein Variationen #04 - Station 17 + Stereo Total + Michael Rother / Remixes by MyMy & Tobias Thomas/Ada (2008)\nGoldstein Variationen #05 - Station 17 + Fettes Brot + Knarf Rellöm Trinity / Remixes by Justus Köhncke & Christopher Just (2009)\nUh-Uh-Uh REMIXES (2011)\n\n\n== References =="

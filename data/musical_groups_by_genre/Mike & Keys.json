    "text": "Mike & Keys (formerly known as The Futuristiks) are an American hip hop production and songwriting duo from Los Angeles, California that consists of Money Mike (born Michael Ray Cox, Jr.) and J-Keys (born John Groover).\n\n\n== History ==\nJ-Keys, born in South Sacramento, and Money Mike born in Hammond, Louisiana, both name church and family as having a huge influence on the development of their musical talents. Graduates of the Los Angeles Recording School in Hollywood, CA, the duo's first full production credit came in 2009 on Before I Self Destruct for rapper 50 Cent. After further work in 2010 on hip hop albums such Dom Kennedy’s From the Westside with Love, II, Redman'sReggie, and Sheek Louch’s Donnie G: Don Gorilla, The Futuristiks became a prominent production team for hip-hop, R&B and gospel artists.\nProving to be a life-altering year for The Futuristiks, in 2011, their work ranged from hip hop records with chart-topping artists Eminem, Royce da 5'9\" and Ras Kass as well as other known acts such as Strong Arm Steady and Mitchy Slick. In 2011, they also produced rapper Problem’s \"Last Love\" for the unreleased mixtape Plan B which received video spins on BET’s 106 & Park making to the Top Ten Countdown and other video mediums.  Moreover, in 2011, they also produced the lead singles for Dom Kennedy's The Original Dom Kennedy and Skeme’s mixtapes The Statement and Before My Next Statement.\nContinuing their catalog growth, the production duo began working with R&B artists Jeremih on the highly anticipated Late Nights with Jeremih Mixtape, as well as debut projects for other R&B artists TeeFlii and Elijah Blake.  Not leaving their hip hop roots, in 2012,  the pair produced tracks for rappers T.I., Freddie Gibbs, Fat Joe, Bad Lucc, 8Ball, Jay Rock, Curren$y and OverDoz.  The Futuristiks made the Billboard Top 100 in 2012 for their production on Capitol Records Tito Lopez’s song Mama Proud. They also made the Billboard 200, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and Top Rap Album for their production credit on Grand Hustle/Atlantic Records artist T.I.’s Trouble Man: Heavy Is the Head.\nAs their sound developed and territory expanded in 2013, the Futuristiks were nominated for their first Recording Academy Grammy Award in the Best Rap Album category for their contribution on Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album, Pt. 1. Lupe's II topped Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Rap Albums charts, while debuting and peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard 200.\nThe Futuristiks began working with Epic Records/Roc Nation Management artist Casey Veggies, helming the title track and six songs total on the awaited 2013 Life Changes. In 2013, they also produced songs for Master P, Juelz Santana, Adonis the Ace, Drumma Boy, Zeke and K.Roosevelt.\nLike many mainstream producers, The Futuristiks, have taken on entire projects and recently hemmed the Executive Producer credits on the Nipsey Hussle’s, October 8, 2013 release Crenshaw.  In addition, the Futuristiks have the majority of the producers credit on Dom Kennedy’s, 2013 release Get Home Safely.  Their aesthetic is fit for dropping the top, with crawling drums and warped samples that never push the tempo up too high for Dom’s coziness level.\n\n\n== Production discography ==\n\n\n=== 2009 ===\n50 Cent - Before I Self Destruct\n06. \"Hold Me Down\" (produced with Team Ready)\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nSheek Louch - Donnie G: Don Gorilla\n02. \"Get It Poppin'\"\nRedman - Reggie\n01. \"Reggie\" (produced with Team Ready)\n\n\n=== 2011 ===\nD12 - Return Of The Dozen Volume 2\n02. \"Fame\"\nDom Kennedy - From the Westside with Love\n07. \"Designer Shit\"\nSkeme - The Statement\n04. \"F.A.Q.

    "text": "Spectrum-X is a Harsh/Industrial music/Gothic/Industrial metal band. Over the years, it has been featured in magazines such as \"Dark Spy\" from Germany, \"Alamode\" and Risknote\" from Japan, and \"Anime Food\" and \"Gaku-X\" in the USA.\nSpectrum-X can have many meanings, a notable one being \"the ghost without a name.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nFounder band members Nullifer and Candy Bones met in 2004, with Nullifer moving to Italy from Chicago, USA in order to create Spectrum-X.\nIn 2004 they released their demo CD \"Dreambook,\" a self-produced metal mix inspired by Halloween.\nIn 2005 Spectrum-X began to work on their first full-length album, Tea Party With Zombies(2006), which was self-produced and released in late 2006. This album is still their best selling to date, and was inspired by the theme of Alice in Wonderland, but was twisted into a darker and more Gothic atmosphere.\nIn early 2006 Spectrum-X also filmed a music video for the song \"SLOW\" from the album, directed by Pananu Productions, with Candy Bones taking the part of a darker and more gothic Alice.\nIn 2007 Spectrum-X met Kiwamu, the guitarist of Blood and owner for the Japanese Record label Darkest Labyrinth. Darkest Labyrinth provided record distribution for Spectrum-X in Japan, and later a record contract.\nThey then released their first single, Gnomes Bones (2007), including a music video directed by Mirco Andreas. The song itself is based mostly on a fairy tale theme of thievish gnomes. The video also followed along the lines of a fairy tale but the band itself were depicted as mannequins.\nIn 2008 Spectrum-X released their second full-length album Darkest Night Ever(2008). This album's theme was a mix of Victorian gothic fairy tales, and a more futuristic second half speaking from the point of view of two otherworldly alien creatures trapped in present day.\nLater that year (2008) Spectrum-X was invited to tour in Japan, where they played a few shows in Osaka and Tokyo, and also made a few in store appearances.\nTea Party With Zombies (New Version)(2008) was re-released under the Japanese record label Darkest Labyrinth.\nIn 2009 Spectrum-X toured in Hollywood at The Knitting Factory.\nIn June 2010 Spectrum-X returned to tour in Japan to promote the re-release and to help promote the release of Darkest Labyrinth's compilation CD Darkest Labyrinth: Volume 2 (2010).\nIn early 2011 Spectrum-X decided to remove most of the electric guitar and acoustic instrument from their music to pursue their roots in electro-industrial music.\nOn October 21, 2011 Spectrum-X released the Album \"Black Death,\" released both under the Japanese record label Darkest Labyrinth and also under the European record label TraumaFactor.\nMore recently, Spectrum-X worked on a new album with their black metal project (band) which is called Abaddon, which was released in 2017.\n\n\n== Members ==\nNullifer: Vocals, Programming, all studio work\nCandy Bones: Vocals, Programming\nAdditional members are brought in for live shows.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n(some tracks originally composed by Abaddon )\n\nTea Party With Zombies(2006)\nDarkest Night Ever(2008)\nTea Party With Zombies (New Version)(2008)\nBlack Death(2011)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nGnomes Bones (2007) Including Music video\n\n\n=== Official Music Videos ===\nSlow, album:Tea Party With Zombies(2006) directed by Pananu Productions\nGnomes Bones, album: Gnomes Bones (2007)  :album:Darkest Night Ever(2008) (2008) Directed by Mirco Andreas\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Macronympha is an American noise music and power electronics group formed 1990 by Joseph Roemer and Rodger Stella in Pittsburgh, PA. Tim Oliveira (Stimbox) and Dominick Fernow (Prurient) have occasionally appeared on Macronympha recordings and live performances. \nA great number of their releases are in cassette format, released on various underground labels worldwide including their own Mother Savage Noise Productions. So far they have exclusively played live shows in the US.\nMacronympha's trademark sound is the collage of metaljunk bashed against each other, layered and looped utilizing mostly analogue equipment. Macronympha has collaborated with many names from the noise scene, including K2, Government Alpha and The Grey Wolves.\n\n\n== Partial discography ==\nInsane Torture Device (1991, Cassette)\nPhysical Chaos (1992, Cassette)\nNoise Terrorism (1993, Cassette)\nInsemination Bath / Radio For The People (1994, Cassette)\nNaked Denunciation Of Infrasonic Exchange (1994, Cassette)\nRelentless Agony (1994, Cassette)\nUltimate Vibrator (1994, Cassette)\nGrind (1995, Cassette)\nNotes From Underground (1995, Cassette)\nThe Spectacle Of Ravishing Our Maidens (1995, Cassette)\nWhite Music (1995, Cassette)\nOngoing Orgasm (1995, Cassette)\nWhorechestra (1995, Cassette)\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania (1995, LP)\nBaroque (1996, Cassette)\nCollapsing Infrastructure Part 2 (1996, Cassette)\nAmplified Humans (1997, Cassette)\nLive Constructions NYC (1997, Cassette)\nMetal Noise (1997, Cassette)\nWhite Album (1997, Cassette)\nNew Noise Loops / Motors And Fine Art (1998, Cassette)\nIntensive Care (1998, CD)\nMembranes And Black Holes (2002, CD)\nMeasuring, Monitoring, Calibrating (2006, Cassette)\nMacrocanibalismo (2016, CDr)\nDiscovering The Unknown (2016, CDr)\nHimalayan Pink, Macronympha / Le Cose Bianche (2017, Cassette)\nhiroyuki chiba/Macronympha  Split (2020, Cassette)\nMacronympha/New Grasping Machina Split (2022, Cassette)\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.discogs.com/artist/Macronympha DiscogsPage\nhttps://www.webcitation.org/5kn4uUMOJ?url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palladium/5854/nympha.html Interview with Roemer"

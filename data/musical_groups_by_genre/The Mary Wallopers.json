    "text": "The Mary Wallopers are an Irish folk music group based in Dundalk, County Louth, originally consisting of brothers Charles and Andrew Hendy, and Sean McKenna. In 2022 the group expanded to include Róisín Barrett on bass, Brendan McInerney on drums, Seamus Hyland on accordion, and Finnian O'Connor on tin whistle and uilleann pipes. In late 2023, Hyland left to concentrate on his own music. McInerney had previously been replaced by Ken Mooney of The Urges.\n\n\n== Background ==\nCharles Hendy has stated that the band's biggest thematic influence has been \"reactionary stuff to poverty\", while the band credit Jinx Lennon as being among their biggest musical influences. The Mary Wallopers cultivated a large fanbase following their gigs they live-streamed from the Hendys' home during COVID-19 lockdowns. In November 2023, the band performed alongside Damien Dempsey, Lankum, Lisa O'Neill and Pauline Scanlon as part of the Gig for Gaza at the 3Arena, a concert which raised funds for medical equipment for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nTheir first album, the self-titled The Mary Wallopers, has been described as \"raucous, fun and captivating\". It is seen as having been influenced by The Pogues and Lankum, as well as embodying the \"divilment\" and \"blackguarding\" of The Dubliners.\nIn a review of their second album, Irish Rock N Roll, Alan Corr described the band as \"Irish trad punks\". The album, though described as bawdy (and of consisting of \"songs about drinkin' and ridin'\"), is praised as vibrant and funny.\n\n\n== TPM ==\nThe Hendy brothers also perform as TPM, a comedy rap duo that are explicitly political, and like The Mary Wallopers, are anti-capitalist. \"TPM\" is shorthand for \"Taxpayer's Money\". TPM rose to prominence in 2015 following the viral sharing of a recording of their first song, \"All the Boys on the Dole\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nThe Mary Wallopers (28 October 2022)\nIrish Rock N Roll (13 October 2023)\nSingles and EPs \n\nA Mouthful of the Mary Wallopers (6 July 2019)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ==="

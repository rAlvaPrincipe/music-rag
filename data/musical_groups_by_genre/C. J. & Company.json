Their highest charting single in the US was \"Devil's Gun\", which reached #36 on the Billboard pop chart, spending 29 weeks on the HOT 100. It wound up being the #100 song of the year on the Billboard's year end charts, (though only peaking at #36), and #2 on the R&B chart in 1977. It also peaked at #43 in the UK Singles Chart. That song, along with \"We Got Our Own Thing\" (later sampled by Heavy D and the Boyz) and \"Sure Can't Go to the Moon,\" hit #1 for five weeks on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.\nThey released two full-length LPs, Devil's Gun (1977) and Deadeye Dick (1978) both for Westbound Records.\nIn 1998 a compilation CD was released with full length selected tracks from both LPs.\n\"Devil's Gun\" was the first record played at the opening of Studio 54 by DJ Richie Kaczor.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nUSA Disco (1998, Westbound)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\nA Single credited to C.

    "text": "The Dallas Symphony Orchestra (DSO) is an American orchestra based in Dallas, Texas. Its principal performing venue is the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in the Arts District of downtown Dallas.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe orchestra traces its origins to a concert given by a group of forty musicians in 1900 with conductor Hans Kreissig. It continued to perform and grow in numbers and stature, so that in 1945 it was in a position to appoint Antal Doráti as music director. Under Doráti, the orchestra became fully professional. Several times during the history of the orchestra it has suspended operations, including periods during the First and Second World Wars from 1914 to 1918 and from 1942 to 1945, and more recently in 1974 due to fiscal restraints. Subsequent music directors have included Georg Solti, Anshel Brusilow, and Eduardo Mata. Andrew Litton was music director from 1994 to 2006.  During Litton's tenure, the orchestra recorded the four Rachmaninoff piano concerti and the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini with Stephen Hough for Hyperion Records.\nIn 2007, Jaap van Zweden was named the DSO's 15th music director, and began his tenure in the 2008–2009 season with an initial contract of four years.  In October 2009, the orchestra announced the extension of van Zweden's contract through the 2015–2016 season.  In November 2013, the orchestra announced a further extension of van Zweden's contract through 2019.  In January 2016, the orchestra announced the rescheduled conclusion of van Zweden's tenure as music director after the 2017–2018 season, after which time he was scheduled to serve as the orchestra's conductor laureate from 2018 through 2021.\nIn 2002, Fabio Luisi first guest-conducted the orchestra.  His next Dallas guest-conducting appearance was in March 2018.  On the basis of this guest-conducting engagement, in June 2018, the orchestra named Luisi its next music director, effective with the 2020–2021 season.  He held the title of music director-designate in the 2019–2020 season.  In January 2021, the orchestra announced the extension of Luisi's contract as music director through 2029.\nThe current president and chief executive officer of the orchestra is Kim Noltemy.  In October 2018, the orchestra announced the appointment of Gemma New as its next principal guest conductor, the first female conductor to hold the title, effective with the 2019–2020 season. In December 2021, the orchestra extended New's contract as principal guest conductor through the 2022–2023 season.  In May 2023, the orchestra announced the appointment of Enrico Lopez-Yañez as Principal Conductor of the Dallas Symphony Presents and Anthony Blake Clark as the new Chorus Director. In May 2024, the orchestra announced that Noltemy is to stand down as its president and chief executive officer on 28 June 2024.\n\n\n== Music directors ==\n\n\n== Musicians ==\nMembers of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra with articles in English Wikipedia include:\n\nRyan Anthony, trumpet 2004–2020, principal 2006–2020\nLev Aronson, cello 1948–1967, principal 1949–1967\nMadeleine Begun, oboe c. 1969–1970\nDavid Bilger, trumpet, principal c. 1990–1995\nEmanuel Borok, violin, concertmaster 1985–2010\nRafael Druian, violin, concertmaster 1947–1949\nWillard Somers Elliot, bassoon 1951–1964, principal 1956–1964\nJules Eskin, cello 1948–1949\nWalter Fried, violin, concertmaster 1911–1914 (also music director)\nRichard Giangiulio, trumpet, principal 1969–2001\nEverett M.

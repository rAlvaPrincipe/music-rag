    "text": "The Screwed Up Click (or S.U.C.) is an American hip hop collective based in Houston, Texas, that was led by DJ Screw. Its most notable members include DJ Screw, Big Hawk, Big Mello, Big Moe, Big Pokey, the Botany Boyz, E.S.G., Fat Pat, Lil' Flip, Lil' Keke, Lil' O, and Z-Ro. In addition, Devin the Dude, K-Rino, Lil' Troy, South Park Mexican and UGK are considered to be \"Screwed Up Affiliated\". Many of the current and former SUC members come from the neighborhoods of South Park, 3rd Ward, Sunnyside, Cloverland, Hiram Clarke and South Acres.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 1990s, a new type of music began gaining popularity in Houston, collectively called \"Chopped and screwed\", which was pioneered by DJ Screw. The sound was created from a turntable technique in which Screw slowed down the tempo and torqued with parts of hip-hop anthems, giving them a new hypnotic & mesmerizing sound which he believed also made the lyrics easier to understand. DJ screw gave many credits of his music to Mari.  In 1991, he began to release tapes, known as \"Screw Tapes\", on which he slowed down and manipulated records by popular artists and also prominently included freestyles by a group of friends and local rappers, who came to be known as the Screwed Up Click.\nIn 1994, Screw moved into a house in the eastern park of South Park, which soon came to be known as \"The Screw House\", where he could conduct his new business of selling tapes and recording freestyles with the group.My favorite song by z-ro is lonely.  These tapes quickly gained popularity in the area, allowing many of the group's members to launch successful solo careers. At some point the business became too much for the house, so the group relocated its operations to a store in Missouri City that became known as \"The Screw Shop\". After years of success that took its members to new heights, the S.U.C. found itself surrounded by tragedy when two of its members died, Fat Pat who was murdered and DJ Screw who overdosed from a lethal combination of codeine and other drugs. However, the group still continues to record new music with many of its members now focusing primarily on their solo careers. In later years, the group saw the deaths of other members including Big Hawk and Big Moe in 2006 and 2007 respectively, as well as the incarceration of others.\nMore recently in 2010, the S.U.C. had a reunion tour in 2010 which included Big Pokey, Lil' Keke, Lil' O and Z-Ro. In 2014, several members of the group appeared on the track \"The Legendary DJ Screw\" from Bun B's fourth studio album Trill OG: The Epilogue, including a posthumous verse from Big Hawk.\n\n\n== Original members ==\nThis is a list of all of the original members of the Screwed Up Click.\n\n\n=== Al-D ===\nAlbert Driver, better known by his stage name Al-D, is a member of the Screwed Up Click.

In 1994 Hawk, Fat Pat, DJ Screw, and Kay-K, collaborated to form the group D.E.A. and Dead End Records. In late 1998 D.E.A. released an original independent album entitled, “Screwed For Life”.

Police were unable to find any witnesses that could provide information on a suspect or a motive for the shooting.\n\n\n=== Big Moe ===\n\nKenneth Doniell Moore, better known as Big Moe, was known for a softer and slower style than other Houston rappers, including a mixture of rapping and singing that he called \"rapsinging\" as well as for his music that celebrated codeine-laced syrup as a recreational drug.

He would go on to release three albums with Wreckshop Records, City of Syrup in 2000, Purple World in 2002 and then Moe Life in 2003. Moe died on October 14, 2007, at 33 years old, after suffering a heart attack one week earlier that left him in a coma.

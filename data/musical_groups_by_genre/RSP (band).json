    "text": "Real Street Project (アールエスピー, Āru Esu Pī) was a Japanese popular music group consisting of two female singers: Ai and Saki. They have released ten singles and two studio albums. They are officially described as a \"Hip-hop/R&B Dance Unit.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally from the Kansai region, the band was formed as the result of an audition contest called \"Real Street Project,\" held by Sony Records. RSP was selected out of over 5000 competitors to win a record deal and become formally released.\nThey debuted with the single \"A Street Story\" in December 2006, which made the Kansai top ten list in sales. The band was featured in a television documentary, and later played a major part in producing a television program entitled \"Street Dance Drama.\"\nIn August 2007, the band released their second single, \"Lifetime Respect: 女編\" (Onna Hen), which derives from the song \"Lifetime Respect\" by Miki Dōzan and includes samples from the earlier work. The band describes their version as an \"answer-song.\" This second single debuted at #5 on the Oricon hit list and moved up to #4 shortly afterwards.\nTheir song, \"Kansha\" was used as the fourteenth ending theme for the anime Bleach, and was released as a single on 6 February 2008.\nIn June 2009, the band released their seventh single, \"アンマー～母唄～\" (\"Anma~HaHa Uta~\"), which is a cover of the song \"アンマー\" (\"Anma\") by Kariyushi58 (かりゆし58), an Okinawan rock-reggae band. The word \"アンマー\" (\"Anma\") means Mother in Okinawan.\nThe song \"Dice\" has also come out with a music video, even though it was not produced as a single, but it is on the studio album \"Dice\".\nReal Street Project once again contributed a song for Bleach with their 9th single, \"Tabidatsu kimi e\" used as its twenty-second ending. The single was released on 10 March 2010.\nOn 14 June 2010, it was announced that Real Street Project would be attending and performing in the United States at Anime Expo, as official guests of honor. Real Street Project held their concert on 1 July 2010 at Nokia Plaza. The Bleach ending songs, \"Tabidatsu Kimi e\" and \"Kansha\", along with their latest single \"Ai Kotoba\", were some of the songs they performed. It was their first live concert outside Japan.\nReal Street Project's tenth single, \"Ai Kotoba\" was released on 7 July 2010.\nReal Street Project's second studio album, entitled \"ii\" was released on 29 September 2010. The album is also packaged with a DVD that contains several music videos and footage of Real Street Project's trip to Los Angeles for Anime Expo 2010.\nOn 3 November 2013, they made their final show at Shinsaibashi Club Drop (Osaka).\n\n\n== Members ==\nVocalists\nAi (Ai Matsuo) (b. 16 June 1985)\nSaki (Sakiko Yayama) (b. 18 December 1981)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site (Japanese)\nSony Artist page (Japanese)\nOfficial Blog (Japanese)\nRSP page at Yomiuri TV (Japanese)\nReal Street Drama at Yomiuri TV (Japanese)\nRSP members' blog (Japanese)"

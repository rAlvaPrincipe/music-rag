    "text": "Lollipop F (Mandarin name 棒棒堂, Japanese name ロリポップF, Korean name 롤리팝 F) was a Taiwanese Mandopop boy band gaining popularity throughout Asia. The group started off with six members, all chosen from Channel [V] Taiwan's show 模范棒棒堂 (Bang Bang Tang, or BBT), a show which sought to create new male artistes in the entertainment business of Taiwan.\nTowards the end of 2009, it was announced that the group has split up, with members Liljay and Wang Zi leaving the group.\nIn October 2010, the rest of the members, Owodog, A-Wei, Fabien and William, were regrouped to form Lollipop F, with 'F' representing \"four\", the number of members in their group, as well as their belief in continuing the Lollipop spirit \"forever\".\nLollipop signed with EMI Music Taiwan on December 2, 2006 and released their first EP in January 2007. With Gold Label Records' acquisition of EMI Music Taiwan, Lollipop was signed under the label Gold Typhoon until 2013 when the group had a contractual dispute with the label.

But after a year, they disbanded in 2017.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2006 to 2009: Debut as Lollipop ===\n\n\n==== Background & Formation (2006–2007) ====\nBefore entering the show Bang Bang Tanga, Owodog and A-Wei were previous members of ºmommy breakdance group Brick Angle Crew.\nIn 2006, Owodog and Fabien were among the first group of boys to be selected into BBT through recommendations and auditions held across Taiwan, the processes of which were broadcast in the show's first three episodes.\nThey were among the first 20 members of the showed which officially debuted on August 17, 2006.\nWilliam and A-Wei made their first appearances on BBT on the October 13, 2006 episode where their auditions during the new selection round were aired. They were then selected to become members of the show.\nOn November 27, 2006, the episode in which the six members of the group were selected and revealed was aired. Notably, William and A-Wei's inclusion in the group was determined only moments before the announcements were filmed. The members signed a contract to Channel V, and Dora Ao became their artiste manager. The group, named Lollipop, then officially signed a contract with EMI Music Taiwan) on December 2, 2006.

Nevertheless, the first episode was aired in Taiwan on July 15, 2007. Later, Lollipop expressed on Taiwanese variety show Kangxi Lai Le that the drama had been more of an introduction of the two groups instead of a major acting challenge, as the members were told to act as their original selves, and that many subplots were explained only briefly due to the large number of main characters. After thirteen episodes, the drama ended on October 7, 2007. Additionally, an official soundtrack was released with songs by Lollipop and Hey Girl.\nThe same year, Lollipop began hosting their own show Lollipop Gyashan (LOLLIPOP哪裡怕) on October 27 until April 19, 2008, when the show stopped airing.\nTheir debut album Gyashan (Chinese: 哪裡怕; pinyin: Nǎli Pà) was released on December 28, 2007.

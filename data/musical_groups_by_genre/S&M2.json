    "text": "S&M2 (stylized as S&M2; an abbreviation of Symphony and Metallica 2) is a live album by American thrash metal band Metallica and the San Francisco Symphony. It is a follow-up to S&M, a live collaborative album released in 1999. The album was recorded during a live performance in San Francisco at the Chase Center in 2019. The performance was also filmed and released theatrically on October 9, 2019.\n\n\n== Background and recording ==\n\nOn April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica, in collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony and Michael Kamen, recorded and filmed a concert at the Berkeley Community Theater. The performance was released as a film and a live album in November 1999.\nIn March 2019, Metallica announced the S&M2 concert. The concert, which was similarly performed in collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony, was planned in celebration of the 20th anniversary of S&M. The concert was recorded and filmed at the Chase Center in San Francisco on September 6 and 8, 2019, with Edwin Outwater and Michael Tilson Thomas conducting the symphony orchestra. The concert also marked the grand opening of the Chase Center. Filming was directed by Wayne Isham, who also directed S&M.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released in theaters on October 9, 2019. It earned over $1.2 million at the North American box office, and totaled $5.5 million internationally, making it the highest-grossing rock cinema event ever. As a result, the film was shown theatrically for a second time on October 30, 2019.\nThe live album was released on August 28, 2020. The Blu-ray release included a new revised version of the film seen in theaters edited by the band, with remixed and remastered audio plus behind the scenes footage.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nAt Metacritic, the album received an average score of 78 based on eight reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nCritics generally praised the album as a worthy successor of S&M. Paul Brannigan of Kerrang! gave the performance a perfect rating, writing that the album \"stands as a tribute both to Metallica’s growing confidence as players and composers, and an absolute vindication of their decision to revisit one of their most inspired creative outings.\"\nIn a mixed review, Andy Cush of Pitchfork felt that the album had the same issues that S&M did. Cush wrote that the songs are not suited to an orchestral accompaniment, writing \"Metallica’s best songs, intricate and ambitious though they may be, are not actually well suited for the additional orchestrating they get here, precisely because they are plenty symphonic already.\" Cush was also critical of the song selection for S&M2, noting that \"Of the 20 pieces of music here, more than half appeared in a similar form more than two decades ago on the first S&M.\"\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nS&M2 debuted at No. 4 on Billboard with 56,000 equivalent album units, with 53,000 units of that coming from album sales.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMetallica\n\nJames Hetfield – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, guitar solo on \"Nothing Else Matters\", \"Master of Puppets\" and \"The Outlaw Torn\", acoustic (rhythm) guitar on \"All Within My Hands\", production\nLars Ulrich – drums, production\nKirk Hammett – lead guitar, backing vocals, acoustic (lead) guitar on \"All Within My Hands\", Coral electric sitar on \"Wherever I May Roam\"\nRobert Trujillo – bass guitar, backing vocals\nSan Francisco Symphony\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nAvi Vinocur – backing vocals on \"All Within My Hands\"\nTechnical personnel\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Espers was an American psychedelic folk band from Philadelphia, United States, that was part of the emerging indie folk scene. They formed in 2002 as a trio of singer-songwriter Greg Weeks, Meg Baird and Brooke Sietinsons but later expanded to a sextet including Otto Hauser, Helena Espvall and Chris Smith.\nThey released their self-titled debut in 2004 on Time-Lag Records and followed that with an album of cover songs, The Weed Tree, in 2005.  This release featured the band's versions of songs by artists as diverse as Nico, The Durutti Column and Blue Ã–yster Cult.  In 2006 the band released their third full-length album, II (presumably so called because it was their second album of original material), on Drag City Records.  Their fourth album, III, was released on October 20, 2009.\nThe band reunited for a trio of performances in 2018 and considered writing new material but decided against it. Their first two albums were reissued by Drag City in 2020.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nEspers (2004)\nThe Weed Tree (2005)\nII (2006)\nIII (2009)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Riding\" / \"Under The Waterfall\" (7\") (2005)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEspers at Drag City"

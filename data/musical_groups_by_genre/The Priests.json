    "text": "The Priests are a classical musical group, made up of three Roman Catholic priests from the Diocese of Down and Connor in Northern Ireland. Fr. Eugene and his brother Fr. Martin O'Hagan are originally from the village of Claudy, County Londonderry with the family now residing in Derry whilst Fr. David Delargy is from Ballymena, County Antrim.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nThe trio have been singing together since they boarded in the 1970s as students at St MacNissi's College, Garron Tower, County Antrim.

The debut album turned 7 times Platinum in Ireland, and Platinum in UK, Sweden, Norway as well as going Gold in New Zealand, Canada and Spain.

Their concert itinerary also took in two concerts in the Millennium Forum in the City of Derry, the first concert coinciding with the release of the Saville Report on Bloody Sunday. They noted that it was an auspicious day for the city and for the future.\nThe trio's first Christmas album, Noel, was released 2 November 2010. The album debuted at number 3 on the US Top Classical Albums Chart and #18 on the Top Christian Albums Chart. In Canada, the album charted at number 100 on the Canadian Albums Chart and number 8 on the Canadian Classical Albums Chart.\nIn November 2010 they released an autobiography Soul Song: Reflections on an Unexpected Journey (Hardback). A paperback edition was released in April 2012.\n\n\n=== 2011–2018: Then Sings My Soul and Alleluia ===\nIn April 2012, The Priests released Then Sings My Soul – The Best of the Priests featuring one new song, \"Danny Boy\". The group then toured in Europe, Canada and the US.\nIn early 2015 the Priests re-signed their recording contract with Sony Music. Their album Alleluia was recorded in 2016 and released on 7 October of that same year.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nFr Eugene O'Hagan is Vicar General of the Diocese of Down and Connor.\nFr Martin O'Hagan is Parish Priest of the Parish of Newtownards and Comber with two churches: The Church of St. Patrick (Newtownards) and the Church of Our Lady of the Visitation (Comber).

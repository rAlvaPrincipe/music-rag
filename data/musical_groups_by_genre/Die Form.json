    "text": "Die Form is a French post-industrial and electronic band formed in 1977-78. The name 'Die Form' means '(the) form/shape' in German, like the Bauhaus diary, and is a play on the English homonym 'deform' and on the French homonym 'difforme' (deformed).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDie Form is the primary project of the French electronic musician and multimedia artist Philippe Fichot. He began his own record label, Bain Total, in 1977 and began recording a number of experimental cassette releases as Die Form, starting with Die Form 1 in 1977, with the first Die Form vinyl release ('Die Puppe') appearing in 1982. Whilst the project was still in its infancy, the underlying concepts were still evident - a combination of esoteric electronic experiments with an underlying theme of erotism, death and other 'taboo' subjects, apparent in both the music and the album artwork, which Philippe also produces. Other early projects of Philippe Fichot included Krylon Hertz, Mental Code, Camera Obscura, Eva-Johanna Reichstag, Hurt and Fine Automatic.\n'Some Experiences With Shock' followed in 1984, with the project taking a direction towards a more commercial sound on 1986's 'Poupée Mécanique'. The project then consolidated its experimental and melodic sides on 'Photogrammes', before introducing vocalist (and model) Eliane P. on the 1991 album 'Corpus Delicti', who remains with the project to this day. The next release, 1992's 'Confessions' saw a club hit in 'Silent Order', with sister album 'Ad Infinitum' (which originated from the same recording sessions) released a year later.\nThe next 'Die Form' releases saw the poetic, emotional side of their sound richen via 'The Trilogy of Passions', starting with 'Suspiria De Profundis' in 1994, followed by 'L'âme électrique' the following year. 1997's 'Duality' does not complete the trilogy, Phillipe Fichot choosing to leave the project open-ended. The 'Histories' compilation discs appeared in 1998, with the next album 'Extremum/XX' appearing in 2000. Then followed the 'diptych' of 'InHuman' (2004) and 'ExHuman' (2006), continuing their release of interrelated concept albums.\n\"The Bach project\" was released in January 2008, an album obviously devoted to Bach. Die Form first presented this work live during the annual Bach Days in the German city of Leipzig, where they got invited.  Die Form has created a new show for this project with the German dancer Sabine Seume.\nDie Form left Trisol to join Out of Line in late 2008. A new single, \"Her[t]z Frequenz\", was released in October 2008, followed by the \"Best of XXX\" in November 2008 (a compilation with reworked and remastered songs from the past 30 years).\nIn 2009, \"Noir Magnétique\" saw Die Form back in a club-oriented sound. The album was made available on CD only, with a special edition limited to 999 copies in a box with a 7-inch single and extra artwork. Die Form created a new show with Laina Fischbeck on stage.\nIn March 2010, a vinyl boxset compilation of early K-Cassette material was released on Vinyl-On-Demand.\nIn 2011, a double-CD digipak limited edition of Sombre Printemps (\"Ambient & Film Music 1+2\") has been released on Out Of Line.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1982: Die Puppe (LP and Cassette, CD issued in 1986, remastered CD issued in 2001 as 'Die Puppe II')\n1983: Some Experiences with Shock (LP and Cassette, CD issued in 1986, remastered CD issued in 2001)\n1987: Poupée Mécanique (LP and CD, remastered CD issued in 2001)\n1988: Photogrammes (LP and CD, remastered CD version issued in 2001)\n1990: Corpus Delicti (LP, CD and Cassette, remastered CD issued in 2001 as 'Corpus Delicti 2')\n1992: Confessions (LP, CD and Cassette, remastered CD issued in 2001)\n1993: Ad Infinitum (LP and CD, remastered CD issued in 2002)\n1994: Suspiria de Profundis (CD only, remastered CD issued in 2002)\n1995: L'âme électrique (CD only, remastered CD issued in 2002)\n1997: Duality (CD only)\n2000: Extremum/XX (CD and LP)\n2004: InHuman (CD and LP)\n2006: ExHuman (CD only)\n2008: Bach Project (CD only)\n2009: Noir Magnétique (CD only)\n2014: Rayon X (CD and LP)\n2017: Baroque Equinox (3 Editions, Boxset, CD and LP)\n2021: Mental Camera (CD, LP, Book, Box)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n1988: Archives & Doküments (CD and LP, reissued as 'Archives & Documents II' in 1991, and as a remastered 'Archives & Documents III' in 2001)\n1996: Vicious Circles: The Best Of (CD only)\n1998: Histories (US edition released as double CD, European edition released as separated CDs 'Histories 1' and 'Histories 2')\n2001: AKT - Sideprojects & Experimental Collection (CD only)\n2008: Best of XXX (3 CD box)\n2010: Chronology - The Bain Total Years 1.977-1.985 (6 LP + 7-inch)\n2015: Die Form ÷ Fine Automatic (2 LP)\n\n\n=== Singles & EPs ===\n1977: Bain Total Cleaning Solution, Music for Deaf and Dumb Persons + Mini albums 1 & 2 (1 copy metal albums, Bain Total)\n1978: Zoophilic Lolita / Tanz (split 7-inch single with Eva.Johanna Reichstag, Bain Total)\n1981: Situation Base / Gestual Equivoque (split 7” with Metabolist, Bain Total)\n1984: Autolyse / Masochist (split EP with Portion Control and Rinf, Free 1984 Sect.

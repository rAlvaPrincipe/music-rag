    "text": "Sergeant Buzfuz are a seven-piece band based in London. Their musical style has been referred to as indie folk, psychedelic pop and anti-folk. They take their name from Serjeant Buzfuz, the prosecuting counsel in the trial scene in The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens. The current line-up consists of core member Joe Murphy (vocals, guitar), Eilish McCracken (fiddle, flute, whistle), William Barr (mandolin), Ian Button (drums), Polly MacLean (backing vocals), Joss Cope (bass) and Stu Crane (guitar). To date the band have released six studio albums, one extended play (EP), and seven singles.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was originally formed by Joe Murphy (vocals, guitar) in 1993 along with Chris Thomas (guitar), Cherrie Fox (drums) and Richard Cahill (bass). This incarnation of the band ceased performing in 1996, after which Murphy continued as a solo artist (still using the Sergeant Buzfuz name) on the single \"Plugged In\" (2001) and album Obsessive Compulsion Pour Homme (2001), on which Murphy played all instruments, other than sitar played by John Paul Jones. Timothy Victor (Folk Orchestra, Broken Family Band, Chris T-T) would perform banjo with Murphy at this time.\nThe album Fire Horse (2004) was again mostly a solo recording but by the time of its release Sergeant Buzfuz were performing as a full band again with Kate Arnold on hammered dulcimer, Eilish McCracken (Rose McDowall) on violin, Jon Clayton (who has produced all Sergeant Buzfuz albums in his One Cat studio) on cello and Martin Parker on drums. This line-up recorded 2006's The Jewelled Carriageway. Timothy Victor contributed banjo to both Fire Horse and The Jewelled Carriageway. In 2008 Jon Clayton left to concentrate on his many other bands and was replaced by John Paul Jones (not to be confused with the Led Zeppelin bassist).\nThe band's fourth album was 2009's High Slang. During the recording of the album, Parker was ousted and replaced by Ian Button (Death in Vegas) on drums for the remainder of the recording. Rich Keeble took over the drum stool and William Barr joined on mandolin in time for the album's release, the new line-up recording BBC 6Music sessions for Tom Robinson (2008) and Marc Riley (2009). By the time the band recorded a second session for Tom Robinson in 2010, Keeble (now an actor) had left to be replaced by Ian Button, and Jones had been ousted and replaced with Stephen Gilchrist (Art Brut, Graham Coxon).\nGo To The Devil And Shake Yourself (2012) was a concept album documenting the history of the papacy. By the time of its release Gilchrist had left to be replaced by Andy Crowe on bass, and Kate Arnold had left to form Fear Of The Forest, teaming up again with Sergeant Buzfuz producer and ex-cellist Jon Clayton. Murphy and Polly MacLean, singer with Slate Islands, performed the album for sixteen nights at the Edinburgh Free Fringe in 2012. In the same year, Crowe left and was replaced by George Brufton on bass who played on, but left before the release of, 2015's Balloons For Thin Linda. By the time of release the band had expanded to a seven piece line-up with Polly MacLean on backing vocals, Stu Crane on electric cigar box slide guitar and Joss Cope (Biff Bang Pow!, Crash, brother of Julian Cope) on bass.\n\n\n== Blang Records ==\nIn 2002, Murphy began promoting a monthly night named Blang at London's 12 Bar Club where he regularly put on acts from the New York anti-folk scene. Blang became the hub for British anti-folk music. Murphy continued to promote his Blang nights at the 12 Bar Club until 2012, ending on the ten year anniversary. The early Sergeant Buzfuz records were released on his own Audio Gland label. In 2005 he launched a new Blang label with the Fruit Machine compilation of acts who had played at the live nights. Subsequent Sergeant Buzfuz records have all been released on Blang, which he co-runs with Jules Dakin (AKA JJ Crash of the band Lucy's Diary). The label has released records by many acts including David Cronenberg's Wife, Filthy Pedro, Milk Kan, Thomas Truax,  Sheepy, Lucy's Diary and Thee Cee Cees, whose singer Chris T-T originally advised Joe Murphy on how to set up a record label and recorded parts of Obsessive Compulsion Pour Homme in his bedroom back in 1999.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\nJoe Murphy - vocals, guitar (1993–present)\nEilish McCracken - fiddle, flute, whistle (2006–present)\nWilliam Barr - mandolin (2008–present)\nIan Button - drums (2008, 2009–present)\nPolly MacLean - backing vocals (2013–present)\nJoss Cope - bass (2014–present)\nStu Crane - guitar (2014–present)\nFormer members\nGeorge Brufton - bass (2012-2013)\nAndy Crowe - bass (2011-2012)\nStephen Gilchrist - bass (2011)\nJohn Paul Jones - bass (2008-2011)\nKate Arnold - hammered dulcimer, violin, vox (2001–2010)\nRich Keeble - drums (2008-2009)\nMartin Parker - drums (2003–2008)\nJon Clayton - cello (2003–2008)\nTimothy Victor - banjo (2001, 2004–2006)\nCherrie Fox - drums (1993-1996)\nChris Thomas - guitar (1993-1996)\nRichard Cahill - bass (1994-1995)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAll released on Blang except where stated.\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nObsessive Compulsion Pour Homme (January 2001, CD Audio Gland Records)\nFire Horse (March 2004, CD Audio Gland Records)\nThe Jewelled Carriageway (September 2006, CD/download)\nHigh Slang (February 2009, CD/download)\nGo To The Devil And Shake Yourself (April 2012, CD/download)\nBalloons For Thin Linda (April 2015, CD/vinyl/download)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nKnock Knock Knock (February 2011, download)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Plugged In\" (January 2001, 7\" Audio Gland Records)\n\"Here Come The Popes Part 3\" (September 2008, 7\" vinyl)\n\"God To Holloway\" (January 2009, download)\n\"Here Come The Popes Part 4\" / \"Here Come The Cops\" (March 2010, download)\n\"Danny's Room\" / \"Molly's Bar\" (May 2011, download)\n\"Gold Feelings\" / \"Cuckoo Boogie\" (December 2014)\n\"S6 Girls\" / \"S6 Sunday Morning\" (March 2015)\n\n\n=== Compilation Appearances ===\n\"Indelible\" on Fruit Machine (26 Seeds From The London Underground) (September 2005)\n\"Adieu To All Judges And Juries\" (Murphy solo) on Shirley Inspired (June 2015, Earth)\n\n\n=== Joe Murphy solo (as Joe Buzfuz) ===\n\"Now That I'm The Mayor Of London\" (Download Single - March 2016)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nBlang Label Website"

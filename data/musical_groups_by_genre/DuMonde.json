    "text": "DuMonde is a German trance/Hard trance project founded in 1997 by musicians Jürgen Mutschall (aka. JAMX) and Dominik de León (De Leon).\nWith the success of their debut single 'Tomorrow', DuMonde joined Europe's late 90s mounting mass embrace of Trance music culture. Follow-up singles as ‘See The Light’, ‘Never Look Back’ and ‘God Music’, along with a string of successful remixes for acts such as Binary Finary, Sash!, Rank 1, Push and Alice Deejay, made them reasonably important figures in the landscape of mainstream German trance. At the end of 2007, the duo split up to pursue solo careers.\nDuMonde returned to the scene in 2024 with the single 'Sometimes'. The project now consists of founding member Jürgen Mutschall with studio assistance from compatriot, German producer and audio engineer Daniel Körber (aka. D.Mand).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nA Decade 1997–2007 (2007)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nTechno Club Vol. 12, with Talla 2XLC\nOn Stage 2004 (Chapter 1)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Can U Dig It?\" (1998)\n\"Tomorrow\" (1998) – UK #60 (in 2001)\n\"Fly to the Sky\" (1999) with Anastasia\n\"See the Light\" (1999)\n\"Just Feel Free\" (2000)\n\"Memory\" (2001) with Lange\n\"Never Look Back\" (2001) – UK #36\n\"God Music\" (2002)\n\"Human\" (2003)\n\"Cold\" (2004)\n\"Ich Will Raus / Let Me Out\" (2004)\n\"Kalt\" (2004)\n\"Singularity 2005\" (2005) with Dave 202\n\"What's in Your Head\" (2005) with Judge Jules\n\"I Feel You\" (2006)\n\"Tomorrow 2006\" (2006)\n\"Gun\" (2007)\n\"Elektrisch\" (2008)\nSometimes (2024) with D.Mand & Talla 2XLC\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nTony H – \"Zoo Future\"\nLange – \"Follow Me\"\nPush – \"Universal Nation\"\nM.U.T.E. – \"Missed Beat\"\nSash! – \"Adelante!\"\nGreen Court – \"Follow Me\"\nJurgen Vries – The Theme\nAlice Deejay – \"Better Off Alone\"\nAlice Deejay – \"Back in My Life\"\nAzzido Da Bass – \"Dooms Night\"\nBarthezz – \"On the Move\"\nAyumi Hamasaki – \"Trauma\"\nEvery Little Thing – \"Rescue Me\"\nBinary Finary – \"2000\"\nFragma – \"Everytime You Need Me\"\nAngelic – \"Can't Keep Me Silent\"\nHurley & Todd – \"Sunstorm\"\nRank 1 – \"Symsonic\"\nCRW – \"I Feel Love\"\nFragma – \"Everytime You Need Me\"\nSteve Morley – \"Reincarnations\"\nCaptain Jack - \"Dream a Dream\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DumondeDJ\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dumonde_jamx/"

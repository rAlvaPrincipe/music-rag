She lost consciousness and fell into a coma (which was a result of the air bubbles blocking the flow of blood to the brain), which was a result of inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game. The incident was not made public until a week later. The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference in order to announce that the member had been taken to hospital and, though she had not yet recovered consciousness, was showing signs of rehabilitation such as eye movement and mobility of her limbs. Following this, police launched an investigation into the neglected safety measures. The girl has since returned to school, although no statement has been made as to whether after-effects remain.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStardust Planet Mobile site\nStardust Planet Official website\nSection 3 of Stardust Promotion"

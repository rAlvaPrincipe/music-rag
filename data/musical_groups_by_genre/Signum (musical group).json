    "text": "Signum is the name for two Dutch producers, Pascal Minnaard (Dutch pronunciation: [pɑsˈkɑl mɪˈnaːrt]) and Ronald Hagen (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈroːnɑlt ˈɦaːɣə(n)]), who create and remix mainly trance music. Since 2007, Signum has been Hagen's solo project.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOriginally they both lived in Zoetermeer, a city in the Netherlands. In 2008, Minnaard moved to Norway with his fiancé, and by 2009 Hagen had taken sole responsibility for the group. Their first notable mainstream success was in 1997 with \"What Ya Got 4 Me\" (based on Tony de Vit's \"The Dawn\"), becoming a club anthem. This song was re-released in 2001 and entered the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart.\nSignum started out on the BPM dance label, and stayed with them until 2003 when the label was disbanded, they then signed a contract with Armada Music soon after.\nWith their success of \"What Ya Got 4 Me\", they continued to remix tracks and produce material including; \"Forever\", \"Better Off Alone\", \"Take U There\" and \"On Stream\". Their next achievement came when they collaborated with the British producer / DJ Scott Mac, to create \"Coming On Strong\". After this, they went to do remixes for ATB and Alice DeeJay.\nWith a large amount of remixes undertaken, they decided to start creating and performing their own material. Their DJ debut was in July 2001 at Gatecrasher in the UK, and they went on to play at various dance venues including 'Godskitchen', 'Gatecrasher', 'Passion' and 'Slinky'. They also played at several music festivals that year. Since their debut, that have played in the countries including Australia, Spain, Japan, Ibiza, Canada and Malaysia.\nThey were signed to Armada Music in the summer of 2003, and released their first single \"Push Through\" on the \"A State of Trance\" imprint. In 2004 Signum teamed up with female vocalist Anita Kelsey, and created \"Come Around Again\", another success, as well as being dubbed by Signum as \"the track they've always wanted to make\". 2005 saw a tour in Australia and New Zealand.\nSignum also produce music under another alias 'D-Factor'. In 2008 Signum featured in the Top 100 in the DJ magazine's awards, finishing at #72 on the list.\nSignum's latest album For You was released on 3 December 2010 by Armada Music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2010 For You [Armada]\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1997 'Adaptor' [Jinx Records]\n1998 'What Ya Got 4 Me' [Jinx]\n1999 'Coming On Strong' [Jinx]\n1999 'Just Do It' [Untidy Trax]\n1999 'The Recycle' (Tidy Trax)\n2000 'Solar Level' [Jinx]\n2001 '5 Yards/Afterglow' [Jinx]\n2001 'First Strike' [Jinx]\n2002 'Cura Me' [Silver Premium]\n2002 'Second Wave' [BPM Dance White Label]\n2002 'Third Dimension' [Silver Premium]\n2003 'Push Through/Sunny Changes' [A State of Trance]\n2004 'Come Around Again' [A State of Trance]\n2004 'Spacehopper / What Ya Got 4 Me?'

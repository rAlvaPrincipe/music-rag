Their first album, Seja o Que Eu Quiser, was launched in 2016. Between albums, their single, \"Deixa\", became popular on radios and streaming platforms, bringing the group to national attention in Brazil. In 2019, their second album, Coisas da Geração, was released and attracted prominence to the group in Brazil and other parts of the world. In 2021, Memórias (de onde eu nunca fui), was released and nominated for the Latin Grammy Awards.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2014, while in the city of Belo Horizonte, Pedro Calais posted a video of some of his compositions on Facebook. One of his friends, who worked as an event promoter at a performance venue, saw his video and encouraged him to assemble a band to perform at the venue. Subsequently, Calais called his childhood friends Otavio Cardoso, Glauco Borges, Francisco Jardim, and Breno Braga, to perform with him. The group began their career playing their music at this performance venue.\nIn May 2016, the group released their first studio album entitled Seja o Que Eu Quiser. In February 2018, in collaboration with the singer Ana Gabriela, they launched an acoustic version of the song Deixa, which became one of the most-played songs in Brazil and brought attention to the group. Following Deixa, the group signed a contract with Sony. In June 2019, the group released their second studio album, Coisas da Geração.\nOn 12 September 2020, the group performed at two drive-in shows in the city of Nova Lima. However, between the two performances, percussionist Tio Wilson (Breno Braga) became ill and died from a heart attack.\nIn 2021, the group returned to the stage with their third studio album, Memórias (de onde eu nunca fui), with Glauco Mendes on drums.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSeja o Que Eu Quiser (2016)\nCoisas da Geração (2019)\nMemórias (de onde eu nunca fui) (2021)\nDepois do Fim (2023)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

Dominant Legs released an extended play (EP), Young at Love and Life, in 2010 and a full-length album, Invitation, in 2011.\n\n\n== History ==\nRyan Lynch, formerly of Magic Bullets and Girls, started Dominant Legs in 2008. According to Lynch, the band's name means \"sexy legs\" and came about while he was skinny dipping in Newport Beach. He used the term to describe the legs of Corey Cunningham of the band Terry Malts.\n\nLynch released two demo tracks late in 2009 and was named a \"band to watch\" by Stereogum. \nLynch met the keyboard player and vocalist Hannah Hunt through mutual friends and the pair soon started performing together. \nHunt was the inspiration behind the Vampire Weekend song \"Hannah Hunt\" from their third album Modern Vampires of the City. The Young at Love and Life EP was released in August 2010.\nFollowing the EP's release, the band's line-up expanded with the additions of Rene Solomon (drums), Garett Goddard (guitar) and Andrew Connors (bass guitar). \nThe music video for the song \"Hoop of Love\" was premiered in August 2011; \nThe group's first album, Invitation, was released one month later.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nRyan Lynch – vocals, guitar, keyboards\nHannah Hunt – vocals, keyboards\nAndrew Connors – bass guitar\nGarett Goddard – guitar\nRene Solomon – drums, percussion\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio album ===\n\n\n=== Extended play ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Facebook page\nOfficial MySpace page\nOfficial page at Lefse Records Archived 2011-10-20 at the Wayback Machine"

    "text": "Neurosonic was founded in Vancouver, British Columbia in February, 2006 by vocalist/guitarist Jason Darr, who was the former lead singer of Calgary's Out of Your Mouth.  In addition to Jason, Neurosonic also consists of guitarist Troy Healy, accompanying vocalist and bassist Jacen Ekstrom and Tama endorsed drummer Shane Smith from former bands SNFU, The Real Mckenzies and David Ogilvy's (Mixer/Producer of Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, and Mötley Crüe), Jakalope.  Neurosonic released its first album, Drama Queen on January 30, 2007 on the Bodog Music label, although the album was released in September, 2006 in Canada.\nThe Multi-Platform game, Scarface: The World Is Yours also features their song, 'So Many People'.\nOn April 28, 2007, Jason posted on Neurosonic's MySpace that they would be playing on the main stage at the 2007 Family Values Tour.\nAccording to the Neurosonic biography on Bodog Music's site, Neurosonic is as \"driven and unapologetic as its creator (Darr).\"  Neurosonic's musical style crosses many boundaries and while it is generally classified as alternative rock, it is also classified as hard rock, also containing elements of traditional rock and pop.\n\n\n== Terrorist incident ==\nIn September, 2006, Neurosonic was suspected by the United States' FBI as being terrorists when Jason's pedal board, which consisted of the board and wires in a hard case, was examined and subsequently seized by the TSA.  Jason had taped Neurosonic's set list to the board, which consisted of most of the songs on Drama Queen.  Some of the song names (i.e. So Many People, Until I Die, Crazy Sheila, etc.) were mistaken by the FBI as being terrorist code, although Jason was able to explain the situation and the board was eventually returned.\n\n\n== Major tours ==\nIn the late summer of 2007, Neurosonic guested at Korn's Family Values Tour along with Flyleaf, Trivium, Hellyeah, Atreyu, Evanescence, Droid, The Changing, and many more bands on the second stage such as Twin Method, Five Finger Death Punch, and Bloodsimple.\nNeurosonic also toured with Puddle Of Mudd in 2008.\n\n\n== Feuds ==\n\nPete Wentz of Fall Out Boy was rumored to have been in a feud with Neurosonic over the song \"So Many People\", which publicly bashes Wentz's ex-wife Ashlee Simpson. Reporting of the matter stemmed from Jason Darr jokingly saying that Fall Out Boy's bass player had filed a cease & desist order. Wentz responded with: \"If your songs are good then sleep easy and have fun playing them - just don't attach me to them.\"  while lead singer Jason Darr has spoken out, saying \"Anyone silly enough to believe I was serious about the comment has no sense of humour. The song is tongue in cheek... meant to blow off steam about a subject that is laughable at best.\"\n\n\n== Disbandment ==\nOn April 1, 2009 lead vocalist Jason Darr announced via the band's Myspace page that Neurosonic was officially over. Jason went on to say the band had been coming to that conclusion for a bit as several of the members married, one is soon expecting his first child, and all of them had been focused on other projects.\n\n\n== New beginning ==\nThe band, minus Jason Darr, has reformed into the new band Crashscene. Their debut album released March 13, 2012.\n\n\n== Chart information ==\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nJason Darr – lead vocals, guitar\nTroy Healy – guitar\nShane Smith – drums\n\n\n=== Former ===\nMike Wall – bass guitar, vocals\nScott McCarger – drums\nJacen Ekstrom – bass guitar, vocals (deceased)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Neurosonic Homepage\nNeurosonic's MySpace\nNeurosonic EPK\nNeurosonic Fan Community\nJason Darr Interview on Type 3 Media\nInterview w/ Jason Darr @ SHOUT!

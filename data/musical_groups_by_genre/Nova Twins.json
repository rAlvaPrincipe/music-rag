    "text": "Nova Twins are an English rock duo formed in London, England, in 2014, consisting of vocalist/guitarist Amy Love and bassist Georgia South. Their debut album, Who Are the Girls?, was released in February 2020 and their most recent album, Supernova, was released in June 2022. Supernova was shortlisted for the 2022 Mercury Prize and led to the band receiving two nominations at the BRIT Awards in 2023.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nLove and South have been close friends since childhood and have played in bands that were often booked on the same bill. Both of them come from a mixed background; Love is of Iranian and Nigerian descent, and South is of Jamaican and Australian descent. (Georgia South's father, William South, is also a musician). They formed a band together in 2014 named BRAATS, releasing the song \"Bad Bitches\" under that name. Later that year they settled on the name Nova Twins, and released their first song \"Bassline Bitch\" under that name, in April 2015. That song attracted the attention of independent label Robotunes, which signed them and released their first self-titled EP in 2016.\nAfter a show at French festival Rencontres Trans Musicales in December 2016, Nova Twins spent most of 2017 touring multiple countries and supported Prophets of Rage, after which Tom Morello named them \"the best band you've never heard of\". They have since supported Muse, Wolf Alice, Bring Me The Horizon, Little Simz, Yungblud, Dream Wife, Black Honey, Enter Shikari, and Skunk Anansie. In 2017 they self-released the singles \"Thelma & Louise\" and \"Mood Swings\", and started their own custom clothing line called Bad Stitches.\nIn 2018, Nova Twins self-released the singles \"Hit Girl\" and \"Lose Your Head\". They continued to tour with shows in Europe and America, including an appearance at the Afropunk festival in Brooklyn. Towards the end of that year they started recording their debut album with producer Jim Abbiss. In 2019, they toured with Prophets of Rage. The singles \"Devil's Face\" and \"Vortex\" from their upcoming album were released with accompanying music videos. They also collaborated with several brands, including Dr Martens on a global campaign, contributing both music and visuals. It was revealed later in the year that they would release their debut album Who Are the Girls?  in collaboration with Fever 333's label 333 Wreckords Crew.\nTheir debut album Who Are the Girls? was released on February 28, 2020. Who Are the Girls? received positive reviews at Kerrang!, Clash, and elsewhere. The band won Best U.K. Breakthrough Band in the 2020 Heavy Music Awards. \nTheir second album Supernova was released on June 17, 2022 and described by The Guardian as “a mindblowing blast of distorted noise-pop – and destroys the narrative about who gets to make rock music”.Supernova was shortlisted for the 2022 Mercury Prize. Lead single \"Antagonist\" won Best Independent Track at the AIM Awards 2022. Nova Twins were named Band of the Year by Kerrang! Magazine in 2022 and nominated twice at The BRIT Awards 2023 in Group of the Year & Best Rock/Alternative Act categories.\nIn 2022 Nova Twins played shows across the UK, EU and US, including a sold-out headline show at Electric-Brixton. They covered Beyoncé’s \"Break My Soul\" as part of BBC Radio 1’s  Live Lounge Month. Later that year Nova Twins released their first official remix of Sam Smith’s \"Unholy Feat. Kim Petras\". \nIn 2023, Nova Twins were the main support for the indie-pop band Muna during their Life's So Fun tour across their North American dates. Ahead of their 2023 Glastonbury performance on the Other Stage, Elton John praised Nova Twins, naming them as one of his top 4 acts to watch, claiming “these girls rock my world… they are just for me phenomenal”. Nova Twins supported Muse during their arena tour for the UK and Ireland dates in September and October 2023.\nNova Twins have appeared on the front covers of Alternative Press, NME, Rock Sound, Upset, Notion, Total Guitar, DSCVRD, and Kerrang! twice.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\n\nNova Twins have been described by The Guardian as a \"bass-heavy duo fusing grime and punk\", and by NME as \"the [band] rewriting the rules of alternative music.\"\nThe girls were first inspired by the music of Destiny's Child. Upon moving to London, Love heard music by the MC5, the New York Dolls, Kiss, the Sweet and Led Zeppelin, gaining an appreciation for live concert performance. South was influenced by Skrillex and N.E.R.D., and especially with the way that Timbaland manipulated instruments with electronic processing. Love cites the soloing style of Jack White and St. Vincent as influential. South praised the way that Missy Elliott \"dresses how she wants to dress and how she wants to feel\", and admired the \"timeless\" quality of her music. Love described how the Prodigy's \"live energy is next to none.\"\n\n\n== Activism ==\nIn 2021 Nova Twins penned an open letter to the MOBO Awards calling for them to introduce a Rock/Alternative category to their 2021 awards. In the letter they highlighted the need for expanded representation within the genre.The MOBO’s issuing a response via Twitter, stating the letter had been received and the matter being discussed internally. In 2022 MOBO Awards unveiled a brand-new category, Best Alternative Music Act with Nova Twins named as one of the first nominees.\nIn 2020 Nova Twins were named ambassadors for the Featured Artists Coalition, the UK trade body representing the specific rights and interests of music artists. In 2021, on International Women’s Day, Music Venue Trust announced the band as patrons of their UK registered charity, which acts to protect, secure and improve Grassroots Music Venues. In the same year, the duo curated and released a 12 track limited edition LP entitled Nova Twins Presents: Voices For The Unheard. The project showcased the breadth and diversity of POC talent within punk, rock and alternative music genres - from established artists to emerging talent. The record was backed by Dr. Martens and released by Blood Records exclusively on vinyl, with 100% of proceeds donated to The Black Curriculum, a social enterprise that aims to improve the teaching of Black History throughout the UK.\nIn 2023, Nova Twins launched a scholarship with London’s international music school ICMP, covering the cost of one undergraduate student’s tuition fees for a  three year BA (Hons) Creative Musicianship degree. The duo announced the scholarship on Twitter, stating: “Being given an opportunity can make all the difference and certainly if it wasn’t for the opportunities we’ve had, then Nova Twins wouldn’t exist as we do today.”\n\n\n== Members ==\nAmy Love – lead vocals, guitar\nGeorgia South – bass guitar, backing vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nWho Are the Girls?

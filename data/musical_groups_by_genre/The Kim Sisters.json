    "text": "The Kim Sisters (Korean: 김시스터즈) were a female vocal group from South Korea, who made their career in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. Formed in 1953, the group are known for being the first Korean music group to achieve success in the U.S. market during the 1960s, and for performing more than 20 times on The Ed Sullivan Show. The group consisted of Sook-ja “Sue”, Ai-ja “Aija”, and Min-ja “Mia” Kim.\n\n\n== Early lives ==\nSue (Korean: 김숙자; RR: Gim Sukja; MR: Kim Sukcha) and Aija (Korean: 김애자; RR: Gim Aeja; MR: Kim Aecha) were born in Seoul. They were the daughters of Kim Hae-song, a popular conductor, and Lee Nan-young, one of Korea's most famous singers before the Korean War, best known for her song, \"Tears of Mokpo.\" The elder Kim died in 1950 during the Korean War.\nMia (Korean: 김민자; RR: Gim Minja; MR: Kim Mincha) was Sue and Aija's biological cousin whose father was Lee Bong-ryong, a musician and Lee Nan-young's elder brother; she was later adopted by Lee Nan-young.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Kim Sisters were formed in 1953. Following her husband's kidnapping, Lee Nan-young adopted Mia and had her daughters form a singing group in order to support the family. Lee bought American records on the black market so that the girls could learn songs like Hoagy Carmichael's \"Ole Buttermilk Sky,\" which they performed in bars and nightclubs for American soldiers stationed in South Korea during the Korean War.\n\nThe Kim Sisters were popular among the American troops, who spread the word about the group to American entertainment producer Tom Ball. He flew to South Korea in 1958 to hear the group perform, and The Kim Sisters signed a contract with Ball soon after. However, it took them nearly a year to acquire visas to go to the United States.\n\n\n=== Fame in the United States ===\nIn 1959, The Kim Sisters arrived in Las Vegas to perform in Ball's \"China Doll Revue\" at the Thunderbird Hotel. After they fulfilled their contract at the Thunderbird, The Kim Sisters began performing at the Stardust Hotel. It was during this time that they were first invited to perform on The Ed Sullivan Show. They ultimately performed on the show an additional 21 times. They made a guest appearance on the Dean Jones Ensign O'Toole sitcom, \"Operation Benefit\" October 14, 1962. The Kim Sisters frequently performed wearing Korean hanbok and singing popular American songs.\nIn 1962, their cover of The Coasters song \"Charlie Brown\" reached #7 on the Billboard singles chart, making The Kim Sisters the first commercially successful Korean artists in the United States. The group retired in 1975 after more than 20 years of performing.\nAija died of lung cancer in 1987. Mia lives in Hungary with her husband, musician Tommy Vig.\nOn March 27, 2014, Sue Kim became the first Korean American to be inducted into the Nevada Entertainer/Artist Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== U.S. singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nKorean Kittens\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHan, Benjamin M.

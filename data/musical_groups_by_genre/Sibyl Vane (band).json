    "text": "Sibyl Vane is an indie rock band from Pau, France created in 2002 by Bernard Cabarrou, Stéphane Sapanel, Eddy Crampes, and Pierre Dutrey.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe French band Sibyl Vane is based in Pau since 2003. They take their name from a character in Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray.

In October 2005, the band released its debut album, Paradoxes, on the Jerkov label. In 2006 the band recorded a cover version of David Bowie's \"I'm Deranged\" for the Chicago-based label FTC Records. The compilation entitled 2. Contamination includes bands such as Arcade Fire, The Dresden Dolls, and David J.\nSibyl Vane's next album, The Locked Suitcase, was released in October 2008. This album was recorded in France and mixed at the Hotel2Tango, Montréal by Howard Bilerman (Arcade Fire, A Silver Mt. Zion). Artists such as Mike Garson and Lydia Lunch have collaborated with the band and appear on the album.\nSibyl Vane has played with artists such as Dominique A, Ulan Bator, L'Enfance Rouge, Tahiti 80, and Calc.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Locked Suitcase (A Tant Rêver Du Roi) (March 2008)\nParadoxes (Jerkov) (October 2005)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nPrêt-à-porter (EP) (self-released demo) (2002) (Re-released through A Tant Rêver Du Roi in 2003)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\n2.

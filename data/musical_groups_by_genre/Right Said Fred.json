    "text": "Right Said Fred are an English pop band formed by brothers Fred and Richard Fairbrass in 1989. They are best known for the hit 1991 song \"I'm Too Sexy\".  \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1989–1991: Formation ===\nPrior to forming Right Said Fred, the Fairbrass brothers had been playing music since the mid-1970s: as part of a band called the Actors, the brothers had toured with Suicide and supported Joy Division at the Factory club in Manchester.\nThe Fairbrass brothers formed the group in 1989, with Richard on lead vocals and bass and Fred on guitar. Prior to forming the group, Richard was employed as a session bassist for artists including Boy George, Mick Jagger and David Bowie, and appears as the bass guitarist in Bowie's short film Jazzin' for Blue Jean. In 1987, Fred appeared as a guitarist in the Bob Dylan vehicle Hearts of Fire.\nThe group was named after the novelty song \"Right Said Fred\", which was a hit single for singer and actor Bernard Cribbins in 1962. The Fairbrass brothers were originally accompanied by drummer Ray Weston and guitarist Dan Kruse. Weston left in 1990 to join the progressive rock group Wishbone Ash and Kruse left the next year. Guitarist Rob Manzoli joined in 1990 and remained with the group until 1997.\n\n\n=== 1991–1992: I’m Too Sexy and Up ===\nIn July 1991, the group released its debut single and best-known song, \"I'm Too Sexy\", on the independent London-based record label Tug Records. The Fairbrass brothers have stated that the song's lyrics are centred on certain users of the gym they owned in London, who they claimed had no shame. \"A lot of models used our gym, so we thought it was time to start poking [fun] at them,\" Fred stated.\nThe song was a considerable hit in the United Kingdom, spending six weeks at number two in the charts behind Bryan Adams' \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\", and three months in the Top 10. The song also went to number one in 32 countries, including the United States, where it topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song earned the band a nomination for an Ivor Novello award.  \"I'm Too Sexy\" has subsequently been used in over 40 television shows and movies, including My Wife and Kids, The Simpsons, The West Wing, and EastEnders.\nTheir second single, \"Don't Talk Just Kiss\", with background vocals by soul singer Jocelyn Brown, was released in October 1991. It made number 3 in the United Kingdom Christmas charts, entered the top five in many countries, and reached number eight in the United States dance chart.\nIn February 1992, the band released its third single, \"Deeply Dippy\". This was number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks, and peaked at number nine in the United States dance chart.\nThe success of the singles resulted in the band's multi-platinum debut album, Up, reaching number one in the United Kingdom album charts as well as charting worldwide. The album remained in the Top 40 for almost a year. In Germany a fifth single \"Love For All Seasons\" charted at # 65 in 1993.\nIn 1992, Heavenly Records released an EP that featured the label's acts covering Right Said Fred songs for charity. The Fred EP contains Saint Etienne (performing \"I'm Too Sexy\"), The Rockingbirds (\"Deeply Dippy\") and Flowered Up (\"Don't Talk Just Kiss\").\n\n\n=== Remainder of the 1990s ===\n\n\n==== 1993–1994: Sex and Travel ====\nEarly in 1993 Fred, Richard and Rob wrote and recorded the Comic Relief single \"Stick It Out\", which was a top-five hit in the United Kingdom and in many European countries.

The band received its second Ivor Novello award for \"Deeply Dippy\" in 1993.\n\n\n==== 1995–1996: Smashing! ====\nRight Said Fred parted company with Tug Records and then released its third album, Smashing!, in 1996 on the band's own label Happy Valley Records, including the singles \"Living on a Dream\", \"Big Time\" and \"Everybody Loves Me\".\n\n\n==== 1997–2001: Manzoli leaves, You’re My Mate and Fredhead ====\nRob Manzoli left the band on friendly terms in 1997.

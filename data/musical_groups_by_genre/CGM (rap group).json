    "text": "CGM (an initialism for Cherish God More, Constantly Getting Money, Certified Grove Members etc.), is a British UK drill collective based in Ladbroke Grove, London specifically the Portobello Estate. They were formerly known as 1011, named after the W10 and W11 postal codes. They are considered to be one of the pioneers of the UK drill scene.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2015, Digga D formed the UK drill group 1011 along with his friends in a local youth club in Ladbroke Grove. They released several singles from 2016 to 2017 including: \"Kill Confirmed\", \"Play for the Pagans\", and \"No Hook\". The group has since been banned from making music together and later rebranded as CGM, an acronym for Cherish God More, Constantly Getting Money, Certified Grove Members etc.\n\n\n== Current members ==\nThe list below includes confirmed members of CGM\n\n\n== Former members ==\n\n\n== Legal issues ==\nOn 9 November 2017, Digga D and members of 1011 were arrested in a stop and search in which they were carrying machetes and baseball bats. 1011 claimed they were making a drill music video, but police stated they were planning to attack a rival gang, 12World. Digga and 1011 were convicted of conspiracy to commit violent disorder, sentenced to a year in jail, and was given a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) in 2018 that required the group to have the Metropolitan Police's permission before releasing any new music, forbade them from using London postcodes, and banning references in lyrics to real-life incidents and people. Four of the group's music videos prior to the CBO were taken down, however, they were noted to have amassed over ten million combined views before removal.\nThe CBO ban issued to 1011 was condemned by the campaign group Index on Censorship and widely described as entirely unprecedented. Digga's lawyer noted that the CBO \"gives the police and probation the ability to control and censor his art.\" The Metropolitan Police has since denied it was censorship. Det Ch Supt Kevin Southworth said at the time: \"When in this instance you see a particular genre of music being used specifically to goad, to incite, to provoke, to inflame, that can only lead to acts of very serious violence being committed, thatâ€™s when it becomes a matter for the police. We're not in the business of killing anyone's fun, we're not in the business of killing anyone's artistic expression - we are in the business of stopping people being killed.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\nHorrid1 and Sav'o - Violent Siblings (2022)\nHorrid1 and Sav'o - Evil brothers     (2022)\n\n\n== References =="

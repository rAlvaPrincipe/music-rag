The band comprises Fredrick \"Joe\" Evans IV on slide guitar and vocals with Brenn Beck on drums and back up vocals.\nThe band said that their main influence comes from the North Mississippi Hill country blues musicians, most of whom were or are currently signed to Fat Possum Records.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn July 2007, Left Lane Cruiser was signed to Alive Records.  Their first nationally released album, Bring Yo' Ass to the Table, was released on January 8, 2008.\nIn September 2008, Left Lane Cruiser embarked on their first European Tour. The first few shows were cancelled due to issues with passports when arriving in the UK, forcing the two members to return to the United States for several days.

In 2011, there were over 300 students in the EYSO programs, from 4th grade through college age, coming from more than 65 communities, from as far south as Aurora, Naperville, Orland Park, Oswego, and Yorkville, as far west as Rockford, as far east as Chicago and as far north as Belvidere.\nThe EYSO is a 501(c)(3) organization registered as a not-for-profit corporation with the State of Illinois.\n\n\n=== Mission ===\nThe Mission of the Elgin Youth Symphony Orchestra is to create a community of young musicians,\nenriching their lives and those of their families, schools, communities and beyond, through the study and performance of excellent music.\n\n\n=== Philosophy ===\nThe EYSO takes a comprehensive approach to music performance and learning, emphasizing total musicianship, critical thinking, analysis, and personal reflection.  Through its annual Fall Camp, year-long curriculum and season theme, and careful repertoire selection, the EYSO challenges students to explore repertoire of the highest quality and significance for its historical connections, compositional devices, social and political significance, and cultural meaning.\n\n\n== Programs ==\n\n\n=== Youth Symphony ===\n(Matthew Sheppard, Conductor)\nFor very advanced high school and college-age students, plays standard symphonic repertoire.

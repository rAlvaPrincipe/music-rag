    "text": "The Laichtín Naofa Céilí Band is a former céilí band based in Milltown Malbay, County Clare, Ireland.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1951, the Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann was founded. This organisation established many local branches, including one in Milltown Malbay. Soon after its foundation, it formed the Laichtín Naofa Céilí Band. The band existed from 1954 to 1962.\nIt served both the parishes of Kilfarboy (Milltown Malbay) and Kilmurry Ibrickane (Quilty, Mullagh, Coore). It took its name from St. Laichtín, to whom a Holy well is dedicated on the border of both parishes.\nThe band took part in several competitions, including the 1955 Fleadh Cheoil in Loughrea (3rd place), 1956 1958 Munster Championship in Longford (winner) 1959 Oireachtas na Gaeilge (winner).\nThe band was the successor of the Milford House Céilí Band (1937-1940s).\n\n\n== Members ==\nIncomplete overview of musicians once playing with the band.\n\nFiddlers\nPaddy Galvin\nJunior Crehan\nJames Flynn\nChristy Dixon\nAccordions\nPaddy Joe McMahon\nMichael Sexton Sr.\nUilleann Pipes\nWillie Clancy\nMartin Talty\nFlutes\nJ C Talty\nJosie Hayes\nMichael Falsey\nBanjo\nJimmy Ward\nDouble Bass\nAngela Merry\nPiano\nColm O'Connor\nDrums\nMartin Malone\nPaddy Malone\nAidan Vaughan\n\n\n== Importance ==\nAfter the Public Dance Halls Act 1936, that outlawed the traditional country house dances, most musicians suddenly had no place to gather and play.

In this way, it contributed to the preservation of traditional music and carried the influences of great music-masters to the new generation.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nLP\nCome to an Irish Dance Party, 1959\nCD's\nCome to an Irish Dance Party, 2008.

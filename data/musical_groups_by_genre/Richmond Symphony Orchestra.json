The Richmond Symphony Youth Orchestra Program includes four ensembles of elementary to secondary school students.\nThe Richmond Symphony is a non-profit corporation partially supported by the Virginia Commission for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts.\nThe orchestra performs five concert series: Masterworks, made up of new and traditional symphonic repertoire engaging some of the best classical guest artists in the industry; Metro Collection Series, made up of beloved chamber music and highlighting Richmond Symphony musicians as soloists in a more intimate setting; Pops, featuring popular guest artists and classical and pop repertoire; LolliPops, a family-friendly concert series; and Rush-Hour, one-hour casual concerts in the tasting room at Hardywood Park Craft Brewery. The Richmond Symphony also gives special concerts and tours throughout central, western and southern Virginia.\nIn 2015 the Richmond Symphony launched its nationally recognized \"Big Tent\"  initiative that brings concerts and festivals to communities throughout the Richmond region. As of December 2019, \"Big Tent\" community festivals have reached tens of thousands of audiences members, generating more than 150 community partnerships and helped to raise over US$400,000 for the purchase of 363 instruments and in support of arts programming in Richmond Public Schools. By the time the pilot period of the program is complete in 2019-20, the Symphony anticipates having raised over $500,000 in donations and buying more than 400 instruments to outfit all 32 RPS elementary and middle schools with a full string orchestra. The \"Big Tent\" program was a major factor in the Richmond Symphony being named a leader in orchestra innovation by the League of American Orchestras through its Futures Fund Initiative.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRichmond Symphony Youth Orchestra\nKaren Johnson (violinist)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Web Site"

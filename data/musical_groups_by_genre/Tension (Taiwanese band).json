    "text": "Tension was a Taiwanese R&B, pop music, and a cappella group that consisted of five members. The band was first signed by Shock Records, then signed by record label EMI Taiwan.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJimmy Hung - Vocal Position: Tenor\nJohn Baik - Vocal Position: Bass\nAndy Lee - Vocal Position: Baritone\nBrian Fong - Vocal Position: Tenor\nRaymond Hu - Vocal Position: Baritone\n\n\n== Description ==\nTension is a Taiwanese R&B/pop group, signed by EMI Taiwan.  The band consists of 5 members - Brian Fong, John Baik, Jimmy Hung, Andy Lee, and Raymond Hu. They were discovered during a performance at a local bar in Los Angeles by Taiwanese artist/producer David Tao. A record contract was offered to them a few months later, which sent them all to Taiwan as one of the first Asian-American groups to hit the market. Their first record album, Smart released in 2001, sold over 200,000 copies in a few months, giving them the highest first-week album sales during its release. After their success of touring and promoting their first album, they headed back to the states to work on their second album. While Tension was recording their next album, a legal dispute was placed against their first record label, Shock Records, making the group place a hold on its production. Their second album, Gotta be Your Man, was released in 2003. Tension received Best Album and Best Hit Single at the Singapore awards, and they were nominated at Golden Melody Awards for Best Group. They signed with record label, EMI, for their 3rd album, Planet love, which was pushed for an early release a few months after. They also recorded a compilation album titled \"Story\".\n\n\n== Disbandment ==\nIn a TV show, Jimmy Hung said they have split up already. 2. After the split, the band members still kept in close contact, though some of the members are in Taiwan and in America. The reason for the split was also stated by Jimmy Hung. He said that their music company, EMI, wanted them to sing cover songs from Korean and Japanese boy bands on which they did not agree on. Almost all of their members are composers and the reason why they are in the music industry is to create original music and not use other music, Hung said. In the end, after their contract expired, they decided not to renew it, and continue pursuing their dreams in a different way.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Smart (May 2001) ===\nOnce upon a time\nSmart 聰明\nOur Story 我們的故事\nWho are we\nWhen I fall in love\nSorry 錯\nGood-bye My Love(piano bar jam)\nIrresistible\nCrazy about you\nGood-bye My Love(last dance jam)\nGood-bye My Love 先說再見\nOne afternoon with Brian\nFriends 只做朋友\nStrange 壞女孩\nOur Story 我們的故事(A cappella)\nThank you(interlude)\nI'll be with you\n\n\n=== Gotta be your man (May 2003) ===\nRound 1\nChallenge 挑戰\nShe's Having My Baby\nTell Me Why\nGotta Be Your Man 做你的男人\nEvery Step 一步一步\nArigato\nOne Minute 一分鐘\nI Need You So Bad\nOne Life One Love\nMy Angel 恆星\nCount off\nAmazing Grace 奇異恩典\n\n\n=== Planet Love (Jan 2004) ===\nPlanet Love 愛 星球\nLove ATM 愛的提款機\nTwo Moons 兩個月亮\nShe's the one 感情線\nBaby Girl\nMiss You\nTime Letter 時空信\nTrue Love 愛星球\nAlways Love You 永遠愛你\nGoodbye 是明天的 Hello\nBaby Girl(Remix)\n\n\n=== Story (Aug 2004) ===\n別想檔住我\n離歌\n我們的故事(A cappella)\n感情線\n壞女孩\nArigato\nShe's Having My Baby\nTell Me Why\n先說再見\n一分鐘\n恆星\nGoodbye 是明天的 Hello\n聰明\n跟著月亮慢慢走\n愛的提款機\n做你的男人\n愛你失去自己\n同一首歌\n挑戰\n只做朋友\n兩個月亮\n愛 星球\nI'll Be With You\n奇異恩典\n\n\n== Publication ==\n\n\n=== Very tension ===\n中/英文书\nPublished on:1 January 2003, ISBN 986-7691-65-2\nTension's first confession of how they were formed and their initial journey and pursuit in their music career with photos of their daily lives.\n\n\n=== 我們炫在一起 ===\n繁體中文书\nPublished on：11 February 2004, ISBN：9578034601\nA record of the Tension's growth.

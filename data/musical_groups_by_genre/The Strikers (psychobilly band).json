    "text": "The Strikers are a rock n' roll band from San Diego, California. Consisting of band members Joey (lead vocals, guitar), Rob (doublebass, vocals), and Donovan (drums), their sound is a mixture of musical genres including rockabilly, psychobilly, and metal.\nIn 2005, lead singer Joey was named Best Guitar Tech in San Diego by San Diego Magazine. That same year, Joey and his childhood friend Donovan began writing songs for a straightforward rock band, and were soon joined by (former) upright bassist and lead vocalist Kyle. After performing a handful of shows, Kyle left the band, leaving Joey and Donovan in search of a new bass player. In 2006, they found Rob, an upright bassist who also shared their vision of music. Joey began singing lead vocals, and the band was finally complete. The three members combined their individual musical styles into one aggressive, \"kick-in-the-neck\" rock n' roll band.\nThe Strikers have toured with bands such as The Chop Tops, Frenzy, and Three Bad Jacks, and have also shared the stage with bands The Headcat, The Meteors, Mad Sin, Zombie Ghost Train, and As I Lay Dying. In 2008, The Strikers released their debut album, No Return, and were also featured on the compilation albums Rebels of Rock 'N' Roll, Volume 1 and Psycho Ward 2. During the summer of 2009, the band embarked on their first national tour alongside The Chop Tops.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nJoey St. Lucas – Lead Vocals, Guitar\nRob Brouillard — Doublebass, Vocals\nDonovan Teske – Drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nNo Return (2008)\nOut for Blood (2011)\n\n\n== Compilation albums ==\nRebels of Rock 'N' Roll, Volume 1 (2008)\nPsycho Ward 2 (2008)\nRebels of Rock 'N' Roll, Volume 2 (2009)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Strikers official website\nThe Strikers Myspace"

    "text": "Bombargo is an independent pop band from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, formed in 2013 by Nathan Thoen and Spencer Chilliak.\n\n\n== History ==\nNathan Thoen and Spencer Chilliak were inspired to start a band after attending the Sasquatch Music Festival. Their shared passion and love of music was obvious to them, and they became instant friends and were inspired to create the group. It was in 2017, on Anthony Thoen’s birthday while in Bali, Indonesia, that Nathan convinced Anthony to join after his own band, Black Vienna, had ended. Anthony then quit his job in San Francisco and moved back to Saskatoon to be part of the band. The remainder of the 7-piece group consists of brothers Matt Folkerson (keyboards) and Sammy Folkersen (bass), Connor Newton (saxophone), and Niall Cubbon (drums). B\n\n\n== Releases ==\n\n\n=== Back on Main and We Are Bombargo (2015-2017) ===\nIn 2015, the duo released their debut EP titled Back on Main which would go on to be included in \"The Top 10 Best Saskatchewan Albums of 2015\".   The band donated all proceeds to the Red Cross to help those impacted and displaced by the forest fires that devastated northern Saskatchewan that year. The second track, \"Let It Grow\" has amassed over 3 million streams.\nThe band released their first full length album titled We Are Bombargo in May 2017. The album single \"Pour Me Another\" gained play on mainstream radio. The song's music video, filmed by Anthony Thoen, illustrates a cautionary tale about the risks of alcohol. The video stars Thoen’s uncle Scott, a Sam Elliott doppelgänger who was 32 years sober at the time of the shoot.\nThe track \"Heros Never Die\" from the album was inspired by Michelle Curtis, who died trying to save several children from a rip tide at Broad Cove beach in Cape Breton in 2015. Thoen was visiting the area in the days following the tragedy and could not think about Michelle's act of bravery without being overcome with emotion. \"It's one of the saddest stories I have ever heard in my life,\" he said.\n\n\n=== Mr. No Good and Oxygen (2017-2019) ===\nIn December 2017, Bombargo released their single titled \"Mr. No Good\" which Taylor Swift added to her Spotify playlist \"Songs Taylor Loves\" in February 2018. Bombargo was the only unsigned Canadian artist on the 43 track playlist which featured established international artists including Kendrick Lamar, Camila Cabella, and Ed Sheeran.\nIn August 2018, Bombargo released their single \"Oxygen\" which peaked at No. 41 on the Billboard Canada Hot AC chart. Following the track's radio success, Bombargo made their US touring debut in September 2019 as part of their 33-date \"North American Dream Tour\".\n\n\n=== Nebula (2020-present) ===\nDuring winter in early 2020, Bombargo went to a cabin in Northern Saskatchewan for two weeks.  They set up a studio to record their next album consisting of ten songs.  To help with the release of the album, Bombargo set up a Kickstarter fundraising drive with a goal of $12,000.  With the support of 186 backers, they raised $22,931. The Kickstarter campaign was also to help cover the cost of production, CDs, vinyl, and promotion of the album.  The album went on to be titled Nebula with a scheduled release date of 27 May 2022.  On 28 January 2022, they released the first single \"Too Close for Comfort.\"  They followed that up with the release of their second single \"Somedays\" on 25 February 2022.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBorn in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Nathan and Anthony Thoen were raised in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. While growing up, the brothers took guitar lessons from Byron Matice and enjoyed snowboarding at Little Red River Park. The two attended high school at Carlton Comprehensive High School.\nAfter graduation, they both attended the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. In 2011, Nathan built and captained a team to Edmonton to compete in the first Canadian National Championship of yukigassen. With nearly a thousand competitors, Nathan's team was crowned the first Team Canada in yukigassen history.\nNathan and Anthony met with the Optimist Club in Saskatoon to discuss their idea of a tubing and ski hill in Saskatoon. After speaking to the city hall on behalf of the snowboarding community, Nathan and Anthony became Optimist Hill supporters and brand ambassadors for the project. The brothers helped fundraise, plan, design, and promote the local project.\nIn 2015, Nathan and a friend went on a trip in a 1984 Toyota Camper van down the west coast of Canada and the United States capturing people's dreams called \"The Dream Journey\".\nOn January 31, 2016, Nathan and Yukigassen Team Canada organized the world's largest snowball fight in Victoria Park in Saskatoon and received the Guinness world record. The record is featured in the 2019 hard copy Guinness world record book.\nIn 2016, Nathan was asked to give a speech to the graduating class of 2016 at Carlton Comprehensive High School.\nIn 2020, Spencer Chilliak and Anthony Thoen were featured in Bill & Ted Face the Music.\nOn 22 March 2021, Tiara Jackle accused brothers Nathan and Anthony Thoen of engaging in demeaning behaviour during the production of a promotional video for Team Canada for the 2016 Yukigassen World Championships that was unrelated to the band.\nTiara Jackle retracted her statement about models being underage.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nNathan Thoen – Lead vocals\nSpencer Chilliak – Lead guitar, backing vocals\nAnthony Thoen – Guitar\nMatthew Folkersen – Keyboard, backing vocals\nSammy Lee Folkersen – Bass guitar, backing vocals\n\"Rootin' Tootin'\" Connor Newton – Saxophone\nNiall Cubbon – Drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site"

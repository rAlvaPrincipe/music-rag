    "text": "Alter Der Ruine (German for: Age of the Ruin—as in: years of existence of a derelict building) is an internationally touring electronic act based out of Tucson, Arizona that began in 2005. They are known for their creative diversity and intense live shows. Their current sound is a blend of Synthpop, indie, and electro although they started as a Power noise act. Each release has seen new and sometimes drastic influences creep in leading to an ever-evolving sound.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2007 the group was signed to Sistinas Music, expanded to four members and produced their second album State of Ruin, which features a remix by Assemblage 23.\nIn 2008, the third album was released by an industrial music label Crunch Pod based in California, USA. In 2009, the band released Beating a Dead Horse: The Relax And Ride It Single available as a free download from Vampire Freaks. In February 2010, a compilation album This is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things was released for Europe by a German label ProNoize.\nAlter der Ruine signed to Negative Gain Productions in 2011. They released their fourth and fifth albums \"Son of a Bitch\" and \"There's Always One More Son of a Bitch\" as two thirds of a trilogy of records. The third album of the trilogy was self-released by Alter der Ruine as \"I Told You Not To Listen Tonight Didn't I?\", which consisted of B-sides from the other two albums.\n\n\n== Band Breakup / Hiatus ==\nThe band announced they were done with a video posted on YouTube on January 4, 2012. An explanation followed later on the band's website announcing \"The Gang Has Disbanded\".\nThe band quietly reformed in 2013 by announcing the addition of new member Tamara. Their seventh album \"I Will Remember It All Differently\" is out on Negative Gain Productions.\n\n\n== Other projects ==\nThe members of Alter Der Ruine are involved in numerous side projects, including the synthpop group Dust Is Noise (featuring Treveloni on vocals, Mike Jenney on drums, and Rouse on synthesizers)\nJenney also does live drumming for Kevorkian Death Cycle and Assemblage 23. He contributed percussion and performed additional production duties on Tranzendance, an album released in 2015 by Arizona darkwave/dreampop band Bella Lune.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Ruine Process (2006)\nState of Ruin (2007) Sistinas Music\nState of Ruin Remixes (2007)  Sistinas Music\nGiants From Far Away (2008) Crunch Pod\nThis Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things (2010) ProNoize\nSon of a Bitch (2011)  Negative Gain Productions\nThere's Always One More Son of a Bitch (2012) Negative Gain Productions\nI Told You Not To Listen Tonight Didn't I?

    "text": "Radioactive Sago Project is a Filipino jazz rock band formed in 1997 in Quezon City, Philippines. The band's sound is a fusion of spoken-word poetry, bebop jazz, and punk. Subjects in their material range from politics, drugs, alcohol, random musings and current issues.\nFronted by award-winning poet Lourd de Veyra, the band has released four albums. The first, a self-titled album, was released under Viva Records in 2000. This was followed by Urban Gulaman in 2004 and Tangina Mo Andaming Nagugutom sa Mundo Fashionista Ka Pa Rin in 2007 and Ang Itlog at ang Demonyo in 2014, all under Terno recordings.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2000, the band released its first single, \"Gusto Ko Ng Baboy\", about a young man's fascination with pigs since his childhood. As the song progresses, it becomes a political tirade against corruption.\nIn 2004, they released the single \"Astro\", from Urban Gulaman, depicting a person's addiction to cigarette smoking. This was titled after Astro, a now-defunct, cheap brand of cigarettes sold in impoverished areas. The song was used on the Pinoy/Blonde soundtrack the following year. A second single entitled \"Alaala ni Batman\" was also released. It tells the story of a man's idolization of Batman since his childhood. The song progresses into ruminations on politics and society, and how these factors contribute to the demise of the Philippine economy and society. At the end of the song, the persona jumps off the top of a building believing he could fly, only to realize that Batman cannot fly.\nIn 2005, the band received three nominations at the MTV Pilipinas Video Music Awards for Favorite Group, Best Video, and Best Director (R.A. Rivera). The band won Best Video, and Best Director (R.A. Rivera).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation Tracks ===\n\n\n== Members ==\nLourd de Veyra - vocals\nFrancis De Veyra - bass\nJay Gapasin - drums\nJunji Lerma - guitar\nWowie Ansano - trumpet\nPards Tupas - trombone\nRoxy Modesto - saxophone\nRastem Eugenio - saxophone\nArwin Nava - percussion\nB-Boy Garcia - turntables\n\n\n== Past members ==\nEJ Delgado - guitars\nJosefa Alovera - saxophone\nRyan Zapanta - saxophone\nJed Punongbayan - Piano\nJulie J.

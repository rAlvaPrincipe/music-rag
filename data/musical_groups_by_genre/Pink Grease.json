    "text": "Pink Grease were a six-piece rock group from Sheffield, England. Drawing from prominent early influences like David Bowie, Iggy Pop, T.Rex and even Kiss, the band's sound and style was often seen as glam rock while also being heavily influenced by such new wave artists like Duran Duran and punk rock artists like The Damned.\nPink Grease released their debut EP, All Over You, in May 2003 to some minor critical praise. In June 2004, they released the full-length This Is For Real, which saw similar praise and moderate commercial success. Their second album, titled Mechanical Heart, was planned for a release sometime in 2006 or 2007, but after the band split from the record label Mute Records, it is still unreleased and just a few promotional copies exist.\nRory Lewarne now sings with White Witches, who describe themselves as \"foppish Celts with glitter in their veins\". They released their debut album, Heironymus Anonymous, in 2018.\nJoseph John Lynch is now a DT and art teacher in a secondary school.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nAll Over You - (mini-album, 5 May 2003)\nThis is for Real - (21 June 2004)\nMechanical Heart - (unreleased, promotional only)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Working All Day / Manhattan On Fire\"  - (2002)\n\"Waiting So Long / Soul Paco\"  - (1 May 2003)\n\"The Nasty Show\"  - (27 October 2003)\n\"Fever\"  - (22 March 2004)\n\"The Pink G.

    "text": "Žalvarinis (Lithuanian for 'made from brass, brazen') is a folk rock band from Vilnius, Lithuania. They were formed in 2001 as a collaboration between the pagan metal group Ugnėlakis and the pagan folk group Kūlgrinda. This was reflected in the title of their debut album in 2002, Ugnėlakis su Kūlgrinda.\nOn 19 December 2023, the band was announced among the competing artists of Eurovizija.LT, the Lithuanian national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024, with the song \"Gaudė vėjai\". They came second in the second semi-final on 20 January 2024, qualifying for the final.\n\n\n== Style ==\nThe lyrics for the band's songs are usually taken from the folklore of Lithuanian people and are sung in their original Lithuanian language. Žalvarinis' music frequently features singing technique of traditional Lithuanian sutartinė (a form of glee), usually sung by the band's three female singers – examples of sutartinė can be heard in their tracks Ailiom susėdom, Dijūta or Ožys. Authentic pronunciation as well as ancient words and their forms in folk songs are also usually preserved by the band. As a legacy of Kūlgrinda, the band also features several folk-songs of Old Prussians.\nŽalvarinis's sound, on the other hand, while still influenced by traditional Lithuanian folk music, is more modern – generally speaking, it is a mix of traditional heavy metal and progressive rock. The first album of the band was metal-influenced, however the sound becomes more progressive in later albums.\nThe song Aš kanapį sėjau (I Sowed a Hemp), taken from the 2005 album Žalio vario was featured on Transformations in Lithuanian Song – a 2006 compilation CD that covered the development of Lithuanian folk music over many years. It was published by the Lithuanian-American journal Lituanus.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nRobertas Semeniukas - vocals, electric, acoustic and slide guitars, keyboards, music director\nSigita Jonynaitė - vocals\nViltė Ambrazaitytė - vocals\nRytis Vasiliauskas - bass guitar\nMartynas Lukoševičius - drums\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nDomas Žostautas - bass guitar\nSergej Makidon - drums\nJonas Lengvinas - drums\nTadas Žukauskas - bass guitar\nIneta Meduneckytė-Tamošiūnienė – vocals\nLaurita Peleniūtė – vocals\nPaulius Jaskūnas – bass guitar\nSimonas Gudelis – drums\nAurimas Lemežis – bass guitar\nMarius Būda – electric guitar\nRamūnas Pocius – vocals, pipes\nEglė Pakšytė – vocals\nDariush Loznikoff – bass\nDemonas – bass\nArūnas Lukaševičius – bass\nIlja Molodcov – drums\nAidas Buivydas – guitar\n\n\n=== Discography ===\nUgnėlakis su Kūlgrinda (2002, Bomba records)\nŽalio vario (2005, Prior music) translates as [Made] of Green Copper, green copper being an archaic name for brass\nFolk n' Rock (2008, Monako Productions)\nGyvas (2014, RS Records)\nTeka (2016, RS Records)\nEinam Tolyn (2018, RS Records)\nThe Best of Žalvarinis (2019, RS Records)\nŠvęskime Laisvę!

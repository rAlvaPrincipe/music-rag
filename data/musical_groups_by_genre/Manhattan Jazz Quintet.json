These later recordings were recorded for the Sweet Basil label.\nGomez left the band after the recording of Manteca in 1992 and was replaced by Charnett Moffett. Gadd left the band, with Victor Lewis becoming his permanent replacement in 1993; Young left in 2000 and was replaced by Andy Snitzer.\nDue to the group's albums limited distribution in other countries (albums are only available as imports from Japan), it is not well known outside Japan.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nMahattan Jazz Quintet also recorded Good King Wenceslas for the compilation CD Chiaroscuro Christmas.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Japanese) MJQ artist page at Video Arts Music"

Shortly after, they would release their debut album, Fiendin' 4 tha Funk. The album sold little outside the Bay Area and only made it to #76 on the Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The following year, they released a follow-up entitled A-1 Yola, which would fare much better on the charts, making it to #33 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #22 on the Top Heatseekers. After A-1 Yola, two more albums were released, 1999's The Overdose and 2001's After the Drama, as well as two compilations, before disbanding in 2001.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nFiendin' 4 tha Funk (1995)\nA-1 Yola (1996)\nThe Overdose (1999)\nAfter the Drama (2001)\n\n\n=== Collaboration albums ===\nU Didn't Know?? with Cold World Hustlers, U.D.I. & Big Mack (2002)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nBootlegs & G-Sides (1997)\nBootlegs & G-Sides, Vol. 2 (2000)\nGrind & Post (2002)\n\n\n=== Solo projects ===\nTaydatay – Anticipaytion (1998)\nTaydatay Presents – Bay 2 Sac (2001)\nTaydatay & Black C – Prime Factorz (2002)\nTaydatay – Out of Sight, On the Grind (2003)\nTaydatay Presents – Urban Legendz (2003)\nTaydatay Aka T-Gunna – Death of a Legend • New Life for a Boss (2008)\nTaydatay & Big Mack – Access Granted (2013)\n\n\n== References =="

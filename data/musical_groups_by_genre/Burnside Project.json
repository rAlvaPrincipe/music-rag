    "text": "Burnside Project was a New York–based electropop, indie rock band featuring Richard Jankovich, Gerald Hammill, and Paul Searing.\nIn 2000, Jankovich released the self-titled Burnside Project CD independently which led to interest from record labels including Bar/None, whom Jankovich signed with in 2002. The album has been described as \"some sort of bizarre pairing of DJ Spooky and Paul Westerberg.\" This album was subsequently re-mastered and re-packaged for wide release in 2007 on Fraga Records.\nBurnside Project's Bar/None debut, The Networks, the Circuits, the Streams, the Harmonies was released in 2003. The album began charting on college radio stations across the country (including heavy rotation on Seattle’s KEXP), and received high praise in mainstream publications, earning an A− in SPIN and placement on Rolling Stone’s “Hot List.” It was also nominated for the Shortlist Music Prize that year by writer and director Cameron Crowe.\nThe single \"Cue the Pulse to Begin\", from The Networks, the Circuits, the Streams, the Harmonies, was used as the theme song to seasons 4 and 5 of the US TV series Queer as Folk and won a 2005 BMI Cable Award.  \"Cue The Pulse To Begin\" also became a top 10 radio hit in Japan when \"Networks\" was released on Sony/DefSTAR in 2004. The band toured the country in support of the release in Summer of 2004. \nThe follow-up album in 2005, The Finest Example is You, featured the singles \"And So It Goes\" and \"One to One.\" Entertainment Weekly proclaimed The Finest Example is You “an apt title, since their songs are great examples of where indie rock should be headed.\" Burnside Project hasn't performed live since April 2006.\nOn September 9, 2016, the band released Syntax and Semantics, their fourth album on Bar/None Records.\nIn late 2022, the band began releasing previously unavailable remixes on digital audio services.\nIn 2023, KID Recordings released the 20th anniversary reissue of  The Networks, the Circuits, the Streams, the Harmonies. The reissue featured 9 previously unreleased songs and remixes including a cover of Electronic's 1990 hit \"Getting Away With It\" and \"He Never Knew The Benefits Of Caffeine (Sack International Remix)” which was reimagined by Grammy-winning producer Peter Wade Keusch (MNDR), WFMU DJ Duane Harriott and music supervisor Alec Deruggerio.\nIn December 2023, Paul Searing passed away unexpectedly. \n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nBurnside Project (2000 / Remastered 2007)\nThe Networks, the Circuits, the Streams, the Harmonies (2003)\nThe Finest Example Is You (2005)\nSyntax and Semantics (2016)\nThe Networks, the Circuits, the Streams, the Harmonies - 20th Anniversary Reissue (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Burnside Project site\nOfficial Pocket Mix site\nBar-None Burnside Project Page"

    "text": "Highlight (Korean: 하이라이트; RR: Hailaiteu) is a South Korean boy band formerly known as Beast (Korean: 비스트). The band consists of four members: Yoon Doo-joon, Yang Yo-seob, Lee Gi-kwang, and Son Dong-woon. Originally a six-piece band, Jang Hyun-seung departed from the group in April 2016, and Yong Jun-hyung departed in March 2019. In late 2016, the group moved labels from Cube Entertainment to Around Us Entertainment and subsequently changed their name to Highlight in 2017.\nThe group debuted in 2009 with the extended play (EP) Beast Is the B2ST. In 2011, they released their first studio album, Fiction and Fact, and made their Japanese debut with the single, \"Shock\". As Beast, the group released three Korean studio albums, nine Korean extended plays, two Japanese studio albums, and numerous singles. The group re-debuted as Highlight in 2017 with the extended play (EP) Can You Feel It?.\nBeast initially received attention for the lack of industry success previously experienced by its members, with media outlets referring to them as a \"recycled group\". However, the group has achieved significant commercial success and critical accolades and is one of the most awarded groups of all time at the Golden Disc Awards, the Seoul Music Awards, and the Melon Music Awards.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2009: Pre-debut documentary and Beast Is the B2ST ===\nIn August 2009, Cube Entertainment publicly introduced its new boy group B2ST (an abbreviation for \"Boys To Search for Top\") on the TV documentary series MTV B2ST. The group consisted of Yoon Doo-joon, who previously competed on another series to be member of 2PM or 2AM; Jang Hyun-seung, who had competed on a series to be a member of Big Bang; Lee Gi-kwang, who previously debuted as a solo artist under the name AJ; Yang Yo-seob; Yong Jun-hyung; and Son Dong-woon.\nAfter changing their name from B2ST to Beast, the group debuted on October 15, 2009, with the extended play Beast Is the B2ST. They began promotions that day for the album and its lead single, \"Bad Girl\", by holding a live showcase and performing on KBS Music Bank. The EP sold over 10,000 copes in its first week of release and went on to sell 40,000 copies by early 2010, an unusual feat for a Korean rookie group at the time.\nIn December, Beast won the Rookie of the Month award from South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. The group's second single, \"Mystery\", garnered them an award for Rookie of the Month at the Cyworld Digital Music Awards that December. Beast also won Best New Artist at the 19th Seoul Music Awards in February 2010.\n\n\n=== 2010: Shock of the New Era, Mastermind, Lights Go On Again and My Story ===\nBeast released their second EP, Shock of the New Era, on March 1, 2010.

The group followed up this success with their fourth EP, Lights Go On Again, released on November 9. The album, which includes the single \"Beautiful\", was the group's first to reach the number-one spot on the Gaon Album Chart. Cumulative sales of Shock of the New Era, Mastermind and Lights Go On Again exceeded 107,000 copies by mid-December, making Beast the only South Korean rookie group to sell over 100,000 albums in 2010.\nOn December 9, Beast was awarded Best New Artist at the 25th Golden Disc Awards. Three days later, they held their first solo concert, \"Welcome to Beast Airline\", at the Jamsil Indoor Stadium in Seoul to an audience of 10,000.

    "text": "The Wild Bunch were an English sound system and loose collective of musicians and DJs based in the St Paul's, Montpelier and Bishopston districts of Bristol, England, named after Sam Peckinpah's 1969 Western film.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group started to perform in 1982 as a sound system on the Bristol scene, with Grant Marshall and Miles Johnson as the main two DJs. \nIn 1984, they invited the young graffiti artist known as 3D (aka Robert Del Naja) to join them, and he soon became one of their MCs, writing lyrics to rap with them.\nOther rappers joined the collective, such as Willy Wee and later in 1987 Tricky.\nAs pioneers of sound system culture they played all-nighters, clubs and abandoned warehouses. In 1986, they played St Paul's Carnival and signed to 4th & B'way Records on Island Records imprint.\n\n\n=== Success and disintegration (1985–1989) ===\nIn 1985, the single Tearin Down The Avenue was recorded and in May 1986 the group toured Japan. After the tour DJ Milo left to work in Japan. The group would perform sound clashes against other sound systems, on New Year's Eve 1987 they clashed with Soul II Soul at St Barnabas crypt, Bristol. In 1988, Friends & Countrymen was released. However, by this time Robert Del Naja, Grant Marshall and Andrew Vowles had formed Massive Attack. By 1989 the group was defunct.\n\n\n=== Post disbanding (1989–present) ===\nDJ Milo, founding Wild Bunch member and recognised as having creating the Bristol sound. Based in NYC, he has lived and worked as DJ Nature for the past three decades and is highly respected in the underground world of house music as a DJ and producer. He also continues to perform and produce as DJ Milo- most recently, at Massive Attack's the seminal August 24 Act 1.5 on the Bristol Downs.\nRobert Del Naja, Grant Marshall and Andrew Vowles, continued with Massive Attack and in the early days they often collaborated with Adrian Thaws. However, differences between members saw Thaws leave in 1995, Vowles leave in 1998 and Marshall took a break in 2001. Marshall returned to Massive Attack in 2005. Thaws temporarily returned to Massive Attack in 2016.\nNellee Hooper, who moved to London after the group's dissolution and worked as a producer and remixer for a number of major artists, including Madonna, U2, No Doubt, Garbage, Björk and others. He won the 1995 BRIT Award for Best Producer. He was also a member of Soul II Soul.\nThaws performed with Massive Attack on their first and second full-length releases, Blue Lines and Protection respectively, before pursuing a successful solo career.\nClaude Williams provided vocals on Massive Attack's Five Man Army released in 1991. In 2010, he was jailed for a series of robberies, for three years, alongside five other men.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe Wild Bunch were pioneers of amalgamating a very wide variety of genres. Their shows mixed disparate styles including elements of hip hop, punk, R&B and reggae. Further, it was their unique focus on slower rhythms and ambient electronic atmospheres that laid the foundations of Bristol sound, which later developed into the popular trip hop genre. They were key members of the Bristol underground scene.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe Wild Bunch is perhaps best known for having been one of the first prominent British DJ and vocalist collaborations:\n\nRobert Del Naja, a.k.a. 3D\nGrant Marshall, a.k.a.

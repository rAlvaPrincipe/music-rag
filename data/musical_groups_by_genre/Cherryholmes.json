Jere already played electric bass, acoustic guitar and the upright bass, and Sandy played guitar, fiddle, mandolin, and piano. Cia began learning guitar. B.J. and Molly began learning the fiddle. Skip started with the mandolin. \nIn July 1999, they auditioned and were hired for their first gig, at Oak Tree Village (now Oak Tree Mountain), a theme park in Oak Glen, California. They continued to play regularly as amateurs at bluegrass venues and festivals throughout southern California and Arizona.\nIn 2000 they turned professional and in 2002 they sold their home and purchased a 26-foot travel trailer, traveling throughout the Midwest and the Eastern United States. They earned enough in the first year to buy their first tour bus. In the spring of 2003 they arrived in Nashville, Tennessee at the Grand Ole Opry for their first appearance.\nIn 2005, they signed with Skaggs Family Records (musician Ricky Skaggs) and were later nominated for the IMBA categories 'Entertainers of the Year' and 'Emerging Artist of the Year', winning 'Entertainers of the Year'.\nColumbia Artist Management (CAMI) booked them into theaters and performing arts centers, and eventually into performances with symphony orchestras around the country. They traveled nearly a million miles in their tour bus playing at bluegrass, country, roots and rock venues, including Lincoln Center, Tennessee's Bonnaroo and CMA Music Festivals, Stage Coach in California. They performed regularly on the Grand Ole Opry. \nThey received five Grammy nominations and a Dove Award nomination.

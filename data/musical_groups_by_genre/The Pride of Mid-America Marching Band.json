    "text": "The \"Pride of Mid-America\" is the name of the Ball State University marching band. Consisting of around 200 members, it is the largest student organization at Ball State.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was first organized in 1926 by Claude E. Palmer, who at that time was the head of the Music Department at the former Ball State Teachers College. In 1945, Robert Hargreaves became the new Director of the Bands, working with Robert Holmes as Associate Director of Bands. The next year, Hargreaves selected Robert Hamilton as the new director.\n\nIn 1950, Herbert Fred was designated Director of Bands. Under his direction, the Ball State Marching Band was one of the first bands in the country to perform drill on the field. In addition, the band began accepting women into the organization, which previously had been only accessible to men.\nIn the late 1950s, Hargreaves appointed Earl Dunn as the new Director of Bands. During the 1960s, band membership grew from 66 to 190, receiving national recognition for outstanding performances. From homecoming parades to playing with outside musicians, the band was on its way to expanding and carving a name for itself. The marching band even participated in the Inaugural Parade for Lyndon B. Johnson on January 20, 1965. The band also performed for presidents Richard Nixon and George H. W. Bush.\nBy the mid-1960s, the band had established a reputation for playing Big Band arrangements for the halftime shows. \"The Pride\" also appeared in the 1965 and 1967 Grantland Rice Bowl games; in televised performances of the Chicago Bears(1966-8); and in the 1967 NFL Championship Game of the Western Conference. By the end of the 1970s, the band had 250 players, and was still growing in both membership and prestige.\nIn 1984, Joseph Scagnoli became the new director of the Ball State Marching Band. Growing to 300 members, it was the first band in Indiana to perform curvilinear drills on the field. In 1989, the band traveled to Fresno, California for the California Raisin Bowl, and to Las Vegas, Nevada in 1993 and 1995 to perform in the Las Vegas Bowl.\"The Pride\" also played for the Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, and the Indianapolis Colts.\nThe marching band became so popular during the 1990s that it recorded a cassette featuring the Ball State Fight Song, Victory March, and Fanfare. All copies sold out quickly due to its popularity. A compact disc was released in 1998, featuring the Ball State traditional songs and fight songs of the Mid-American Conference. By the end of the decade, Christian Zembower had become the new director.\nIn 2006, Dr. Thomas Caneva was appointed Director of Bands, and Dan Kalantarian was appointed associate Director of Bands. In 2007, the band executed new drills, debuted a new uniform, and performed for David Letterman (Ball State's most famous alumnus) at the inauguration of the new Letterman Communication and Media Building. They also performed a pregame and halftime show at Indiana University and had an appearance at the International Bowl in early 2008.\nThe band's other appearances included an Indianapolis Colts game at the new Lucas Oil Stadium, an appearance at the MAC Championship in Detroit, Michigan, a trip in early 2009 to Mobile, Alabama for the GMAC Bowl, an appearance at the 2019 Ruoff Kick Off Classic versus Indiana University at Lucas Oil Stadium, and a trip to the 2021 TaxAct Camellia Bowl versus Georgia State at the Cramton Bowl Stadium in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\n\n== Namesake ==\nThe name, \"Pride of Mid-America,\" was first introduced in the 1960s by former director Earl Dunn. It is speculated that the name came from the prestige and recognition that the marching band started to have at the time. It was perhaps linked to the sudden growth in number of members during Dunn's direction, or to the university's participation in the Mid-American Conference. What inspired the name is not clearly determined.\n\nToday, the name represents Ball State and its traditions, and it has become the main title of the marching band. It is also used as encouragement for the members, such as the traditional dismissal after every rehearsal or performance, which goes:\nLeader: Band who are we?!\nBand: Ball State!\nLeader: I said band who are we? \nBand: Ball State!\nLeader: What do we have?!\nBand: PRIDE!\nLeader: I said what do we have?!\nBand: PRIDE!\nLeader: Let's go, let's go!\nBand: Let's go, Ball U!\nThe band members have also started a tradition of singing the words to the Ball State University Victory March at the conclusion of each rehearsal. The words to this festive march were resurrected in 2017.\n\n\n== Organization ==\n\n\n=== Instruments and Auxiliary groups ===\n\"The Pride\" consists of a great number of brass and woodwind players, and a limited number of percussion players who are required to audition.

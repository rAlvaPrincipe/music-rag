Consisting of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Alex Gaskarth, lead guitarist Jack Barakat, bassist/backing vocalist Zack Merrick, and drummer Rian Dawson, the band took its name from lyrics in the song \"Head on Collision\" by New Found Glory. The band has consistently done year-long tours, headlined numerous tours, and has appeared at music festivals including Warped Tour, Reading and Leeds, and Soundwave.\nBeginning as a band in high school, All Time Low released their debut EP, The Three Words to Remember in Dealing with the End EP, in 2004 through local label Emerald Moon. Since then, the band has released nine studio albums: The Party Scene (2005), So Wrong, It's Right (2007), Nothing Personal (2009), Dirty Work (2011), Don't Panic (2012), Future Hearts (2015), Last Young Renegade (2017), Wake Up, Sunshine (2020), and Tell Me I'm Alive (2023).

    "text": "Bowerbirds is an American folk band formed in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States, in 2006.  The group comprises Philip Moore (vocals, guitar), Beth Tacular (accordion, vocals) and Mark Paulson (violin, vocals).  Allmusic writer Stewart Mason places their sound on \"the dividing line between the freak folk contingent led by Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom and the more straightforward sunshine pop of Lavender Diamond.\"  Their debut album, Hymns for a Dark Horse, released under Burly Time Records in 2007, received favorable reviews from publications such as Pitchfork, Time Out New York and Prefix Magazine. Bowerbirds have toured in support of The Mountain Goats, with John Darnielle referring to the band as his \"favorite new band in forever\". Their second album, Upper Air, was released July 7, 2009. The band released The Clearing on March 6, 2012.\nTheir most recent offering was 2021's \"becalmyounglovers,\" which was released on April 30.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nHymns for a Dark Horse (2007)\nUpper Air (2009)\nThe Clearing (2012)\nbecalmyounglovers (2021)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nDanger at Sea (2006)\nLost Souls EP (2013)\nEndless Chase: 2020 Singles (2020)\nAzaleas (2020)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nNorthern Lights (2009)\nIn Our Talons (2009)\nIn the Yard / Always an Ear to Bend (2012)\nEndless Chase / High Rise (2020)\nThrift Store / High Rise (2020)\nSeems Impossible (2020)\n\n\n== Other appearances ==\nYou Be My Heart (2013)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nBand page at Dead Oceans\nIn-Depth Interview at Folk Radio UK"

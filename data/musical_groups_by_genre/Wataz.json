The group released one album, 1998's Natural High, which peaked at 68 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, and had one charting single \"Ohh Ahh Ohh\", which made it to 81 on the R&B/Hip-Hop charts.\nKatrina “Taz” Askew has been referenced to be involved in the mismanagement and alleged sexual abuse of young artists signed to The Ultimate Group (TUG) record label alongside label mate, Chris Stokes.

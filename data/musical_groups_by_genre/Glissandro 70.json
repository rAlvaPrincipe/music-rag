    "text": "Glissandro 70 was a Canadian Afrobeat band based in Toronto, Ontario. Its members were Craig Dunsmuir  (a.k.a. Kanada 70, Guitarkestra) and Sandro Perri (a.k.a. Polmpo Polpo), who play a blend of dance and experimental rock styles.\n\n\n== History ==\nDunsmuir and Perri began by creating music for an audio weblog.  They continued to collaborate intermittently over a period of three years, beginning in 2004, and  released their self-titled five-track debut album on Constellation Records in 2006, to positive reviews. Although the two musicians also play rock music together in another of Perri's bands, the musical style of this project is more dance-oriented. The album appeared on the !earshot campus and community radio charts in April that year.\nGlissandro 70 also contributed a track, \"Voices Are Your Best Friend\", to the children's compilation album See You on the Moon!, released  by Paper Bag Records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nGlissandro 70 (2006)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGlissandro 70 Archived 2009-03-28 at the Wayback Machine\nGlissandro 70 at Constellation Records"

Two compilation albums were also released on Hansa and Repertoire Records.\n\n\n== After the Catch ==\nChris Whitten has recorded and played drums as a session musician for many bands and artists during his career including Paul McCartney, Dire Straits, Tom Jones, Johnny Cash, the Pretenders, Swing Out Sister, Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, Julian Cope, ABC, the The, the Waterboys and Fredericks Goldman Jones.\nDon Snow, now known as Jonn Savannah, is a multi-instrumentalist and has also played for many bands and artists including Lene Lovich, Procol Harum, Van Morrison, Tina Turner, the Vibrators, the Quick, Judie Tzuke, Tracey Ullman, Nik Kershaw, ABC, Sheila Walsh, Holly Johnson, Right Said Fred, Ray Charles, Gary Moore and Joe Cocker.

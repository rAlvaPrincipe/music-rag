    "text": "8 Bit Weapon is an American chiptune music band formed in Ventura County, California, by Seth and Michelle Sternberger. It was originally created by Seth Sternberger around 1998. Its instruments consists primarily of old 8-bit and 16-bit computers (with 8-bit audio output) such as the VIC-20, Commodore 64, Commodore 128,  Amiga 500, and the Apple II, as well as game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, Atari 2600, and an Intellivision synthesizer.\nThe band started around 1998 by remixing Commodore 64 SID tunes like Crazy Comets, M.U.L.E., and some Nintendo NES game music such as Super Mario Bros. 2 and Metroid. Both the SID remixes can be heard on the album titled \"Confidential 1.0\" and the Nintendo remixes on the band's official website. Later on, they began writing original music using the Commodore 64, Nintendo Game Boy, and NES, as well as other 8 bit consoles and computers.\nThe band has become well known recently after favorable coverage in the Los Angeles Times, A live performance on G4's Attack of the Show, and performances at E3 2004, 2005, and 2006. The project with Nokia is the soundtrack for Reset Generation (previously known under the code name \"Project White Rock\"), a game by RedLynx for N-Gage 2.0 and PCs.\nXbox’s exclusive Halo 2 E3 2004 preview event had its own 15-minute soundtrack written and produced by 8 Bit Weapon, which was played continuously in the gaming area of the party. The band has also remixed music for Erasure, Information Society, and Kraftwerk.\nIn July 2007, they were hired to perform at Commodore's 25th anniversary party for the Commodore 64 computer.\nOn March 16, 2012, the Smithsonian American Art Museum's \"The Art of Video Games\" exhibit opened featuring a chipmusic soundtrack at the entrance by artists 8 Bit Weapon & ComputeHer. 8 Bit Weapon also created a track called \"The Art of Video Games Anthem\" for the exhibit as well.\nIn July 2017, they released \"Class Apples\", the world's first 100% Apple II based music album, featuring dance-oriented versions of classical music by Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart, recorded directly from the Apple II motherboard, including the drum sounds.\n\nIn November 2024, 8 Bit Weapon made the world's first \"rogue-like\" 100% randomly arranged video game soundtrack for Bub-O Burst on Steam.  \"Every piece of music in  Bub-O Burst is randomized. We created randomised music for every portion of the game: the intro, the levels, and even the ending is randomised. Every time a player launches a new game of Bub-O Burst, the soundtrack takes musically interchangeable drum, bass, & lead loops I created from scratch and arranges them into songs with verses, chorus’, and bridges that make the soundtrack.\"  \n\n\n== Apple II Digital Music Synthesizer ==\nOn February 9, 2010, 8 Bit Weapon released the Apple II Digital Music Synthesizer (or D.M.S.). Together Michael J. Mahon and 8 Bit Weapon created the 1st wavetable synthesizer for the Apple IIe, IIc, IIc+ and IIGS computers. The software is designed for live performance and it does not require a monitor to work. It supports up to 8 voices, which can be selected from the 10 on disk, and played (monophonically) from the Apple II keyboard. It can be used to “record” a performance for later playback as well.\n\n\n== Sony Loop Library ==\nIn April 2009, Sony Creative Software released \"8 Bit Weapon: A Chiptune Odyssey\" loop and sample Library. The library contains music loops and samples made by the band of the following computers and video game consoles: Apple II, Commodore 64, NES, Game Boy, and the Atari 2600.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nSeth Sternberger: Founded the band around 1998–1999 and is the primary songwriter. He plays Commodore 64/128, Apple IIc, Game Boys, and lead vocals (via vocoder) at live events.\nMichelle Sternberger: Joined the band in October 2006 and writes music for the band as well. She also has her own solo releases under the name ComputeHer. She plays Commodore 64/128, Apple IIe drums, acoustic drums, and synths at live events.\n\n\n== ComputeHer ==\nAs mentioned above, Michelle has a solo band called ComputeHer. Created by Michelle Sternberger in 2005, she makes music using 8-bit computers and video game console sound chips. Besides her work with 8 Bit Weapon, ComputeHer's most notable work is her contribution to the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington D.C. Her music was included in an exhibition called \"The Art of Video Games\", where she provided the soundtrack to a video of featured video games at the entrance of the gallery. This exhibition traveled to multiple cities following its presentation in Washington, D.C., in March 2012.\nComputeHer has performed at many events. She was mentioned in The Wall Street Journal for her performance at the opening of the International Video Game Hall of Fame in Ottumwa, Iowa, in 2010. She performed at the Sanrio 50th Anniversary I Love Nerds party. ComputeHer performed at the Smithsonian American Art Museum for the Art of Video Games exhibition opening event in March 2012.\nMichelle's past projects include music projects for Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo, Foundation 9 Entertainment, Sony Creative Software, and King of Kong: Fistful of Quarters DVD.\nMichelle's songs are featured in a video game soundtrack for DeRail Games, Panick Attack, on Xbox Live Marketplace.\n\n\n== Former members ==\nMelBot (2006–2008): Played keyboards at live events.

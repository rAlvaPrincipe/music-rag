The band was formed under advice from Morphine frontman Mark Sandman.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMr. Airplane Man released their first album Red Lite in 2001. The album drew comparisons to The White Stripes and Howlin' Wolf.\nThey released their second album in 2002 titled Moanin'. This was followed up with a third album in 2004 titled C'mon DJ.\nThe duo later were asked to open for Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The White Stripes and The Strokes. The duo released an EP in 2012 titled Shakin' Around.\nAfter their third album, the duo went on hiatus, citing lack of inspiration.

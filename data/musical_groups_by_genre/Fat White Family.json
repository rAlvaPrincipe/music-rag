    "text": "Fat White Family are an English rock band, formed in 2011 in Peckham, South London. Brothers Lias and Nathan Saoudi have remained the project's sole constant members across multiple line-up changes. The band's current line-up also includes Adam J Harmer (guitar), Adam Brennan (bass), Alex White (saxophone) and Guilherme Fells (drums). Former guitarist and vocalist Saul Adamczewski has been an on-again-off-again member of the band across its career. \nKnown for their energetic live performances and chaotic personal lives, the band has released four studio albums: Champagne Holocaust (2013), Songs for Our Mothers (2016), Serfs Up! (2019) and Forgiveness Is Yours (2024). \nIn 2022, Lias Saoudi and writer Adelle Stripe co-wrote the autobiographical book, Ten Thousand Apologies: Fat White Family and the Miracle of Failure, which chronicled the band's turbulent history. \n\n\n== History ==\nBrothers Lias and Nathan Saoudi grew up in Southampton, Ireland and Scotland before forming The Saudis with Alex Sebley in the 2000s, including a tour to their father's home country of Algeria.\nThey later formed Fat White Family in 2011 with lead guitarist Saul Adamczewski - he was previously frontman of indie pop band the Metros, which also featured Fat White Family's bass player, Joe Pancucci.  Adam Harmer (guitarist) had been a solo artist before joining the original six-piece lineup which also featured Dan Lyons on drums. The band would rehearse at the Queen's Head, Stockwell.\nThey released their debut album, Champagne Holocaust, in 2013, on UK label Trashmouth Records. It was released in 2014 in the U.S. on Fat Possum Records. The band released Fat Whites/Taman Shud, a split EP with Taman Shud, on 11 December 2013 on Trashmouth.\nOn 10 March 2014, Fat White Family issued their first single, \"Touch the Leather\", on Hate Hate Hate Records.\nIn early 2014, the band launched a PledgeMusic campaign to fund their show at the South by Southwest festival, with a subsequent US tour. Pledgers were given the self-released EP Crippled B-Sides and Inconsequential Rarities. Next was the single \"I Am Mark E Smith\" (referencing singer Mark E. Smith of the Fall), released on 15 December 2014.\nTheir second album, Songs for Our Mothers, was released in 2016 by the Without Consent label. Lias Saoudi described the album as an attempt to \"really to get at the shittiness lurking in the core of my own soul, and in everybody else's\". It was promoted with a single for \"Whitest Boy on the Beach\", which was later chosen for the closing credits of the 2017 film T2 Trainspotting.\nFat White Family's next single, \"Breaking Into Aldi\", was released on 16 August 2016. The single was recorded with Sean Lennon, as well as Cole Alexander from The Black Lips.\nOn 9 January 2019, Fat White Family announced that their third album, Serfs Up!, would be released on 19 April 2019 on Domino Records. This was followed by the singles \"Feet\" and \"Tastes Good with the Money\", the latter featuring spoken lyrics by Baxter Dury, and a video directed by Róisín Murphy. The album was described as \"triumphant\" and \"transcendent\" by Adelle Stripe in The Quietus, and The Irish Times said it \"feels like a pop album you might slap on as the world is about to end or you’ve just learned Brexit has been pushed back to 2020\".\nIn 2022, a biography of the band – Ten Thousand Apologies: Fat White Family and the Miracle of Failure – was released, co-written by Lias Saoudi and Adelle Stripe. Writing in The Observer, Miranda Sawyer described it as \"the story of a band that's always on the brink: of stardom, of madness, of brilliance, of disgrace\". It was shortlisted for the 2023 Penderyn Music Book Prize.\nOn 26 April 2024, the band released their fourth album Forgiveness Is Yours.\n\n\n== Other projects ==\nIn 2014, the post-punk and disco group Warmduscher formed and both Saoudi brothers and Adamczewski are on-and-off collaborators in the studio and at live sets. Other Fat White Family members with a more consistent role in Warmduscher are Harmer, Everett and Romans-Hopcraft.\nIn 2015, Adamczewski and Lias Saoudi collaborated with Adrian Flanagan and Dean Honer of experimental band Eccentronic Research Council on their album Johnny Rocket, Narcissist & Music Machine... I'm Your Biggest Fan. After its release, the partnership took concepts from the album to form a new band called the Moonlandingz. The act ended up touring together, as well as working with Sean Lennon, Yoko Ono, Philip Oakey, Randy Jones and Slow Club frontwoman Rebecca Taylor, resulting in the 2017 release of their debut album, Interplanetary Class Classics.\nIn January 2017, Adamczewski formed the band Insecure Men with Lennon (guitar), Ben Romans-Hopcraft (bass), Jack Everett (drums), Jon Catfish de Lorene (keyboards) and Alex White (saxophone). Lennon co-produced their eponymous debut album, released in February 2018.\nLias Saoudi is a member of Decius alongside Liam and Luke May (founders of Trashmouth Records) and Quinn Whalley (Paranoid London/Warmduscher). The group released their debut full-length album Decius Vol. I on The Leaf Label in November 2022.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\n\nLias Kaci Saoudi – lead vocals\nNathan Saoudi – keyboards\nAdam J.

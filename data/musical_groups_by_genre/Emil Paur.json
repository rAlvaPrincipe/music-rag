He then emigrated to the United States where he led the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1893 to 1898, New York Philharmonic from 1898 to 1902 and Pittsburgh Symphony from 1904 to 1910. He was married to pianist Maria Burger from 1862 until her death in 1899. After returning to Germany, he went on to conduct the Berlin State Opera.  Paur was considered a serious conductor, favouring the works of Johannes Brahms, which were at the time considered heavy listening. He played both the violin and piano. He recorded 23 works on Welte-Mignon reproducing piano rolls.\nPaur died in Místek, Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nEmil Paur at the Pittsburgh Symphony\nKenny, Ellen (September 1951). \"Some Letters to Emil Paur\".

    "text": "Johnny Hamp's Kentucky Serenaders was a US jazz and dance band, active from the late 1910s through the 1920s.  The group was known simply as The Serenaders until Johnny Hamp became the band leader. Johnny Hamp was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and should not be confused with British television producer Johnnie Hamp.  According to some sources, he became the leader by chance when the band was performing at the Hershey Ballroom in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The band leader at the time had an argument with the players and walked out. Hamp, who never played a musical instrument in spite of being a jazz fan and had no experience as a conductor (in addition, he only sang whenever the chorus was performed by a vocal ensemble or the whole band), volunteered to lead them for the rest of the evening and they accepted. After the performance, the band asked him to stay on as leader.  The \"Kentucky\" in the name appears to be related to the band's use of \"My Old Kentucky Home\" as a theme song, rather than any connection to the U.S. state of Kentucky.\nThe group toured in the eastern United States and toured England in 1930.  In 1931, the group was renamed Johnny Hamp and His Orchestra.\nThe group made most of its recordings in New York City on the Victor label.  Their biggest hit was \"Black Bottom\" recorded in 1926, which led to a dance fad; see Black Bottom (dance).\nHamp continued to record for Victor until April, 1932.  The next session was in August, 1935 for ARC (Melotone, Perfect, Romeo, Oriole).  In December, 1936, Hamp was back with Victor recording for their Bluebird label for only two sessions (the second in February, 1937), which turned out to be their last session.\nBand members at different times included:\n\nHoward Bartlett on clarinet, soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, vocals\nWilliam Benedict on trombone\nLester Brewer on trumpet\nCharles Buckwalter on piano, vocals and as arranger\nFranklyn Baur on vocals\nJoe Cassidy on clarinet, alto saxophone, vocals\nRoy Cropper on vocals\nCharles Dale on clarinet, soprano saxophone, alto saxophone\nCliff Gamet on alto saxophone, vocals\nCarl Grayson (r.n.: Graub) on violin, vocals\nElwood Groff on bass brass, vocals\nIrwin Hood on piano\nLewis James on vocals\nJohnny Marvin on vocals\nJohnny McAfee on saxophone, vocals\nFrank Masterson on banjo, vocals\nFrank Munn on vocals\nBilly Murray on vocals\nWalter Pontius on vocals\nElliot Shaw on vocals\nCharles Socci on guitar, vocals\nRay Stillson on clarinet, soprano saxophone, alto saxophone\nJohn Strouse on drums\nClayton Tewkesbury on trumpet\nHal White on violin, vocals\nJayne Whitney on vocals\nMelvin Watkins playing clarinet and saxophone\nJohnny Hamp led other bands in the 1930s and early 1940s ending up as a hotel house band leader in Chicago.\n\n\n== Partial discography ==\n\"Breeze Blow My Baby Back\" 1919\n\"Angry\" 1925\n\"Black Bottom\" 1926 (see 1926 in music) \n\"If I Had a Talking Picture of You\" 1929 (see 1929 in music)\n\"Venetian Moon\" (released on 78 RPM by Columbia records)\nThe first reference below has a detailed discography.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRedHotJazz.com\nInternet Movie Database\nPastPerfect.com\nDismuke's Hit of the Week, September 2003\nSolid! - Johnny Hamp\nJohnny Hamp: Information for Answers.com"

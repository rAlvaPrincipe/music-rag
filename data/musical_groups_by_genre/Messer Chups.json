    "text": "Messer Chups is a surf rock band from Saint Petersburg, Russia. The group was formed in 1998 by composer and guitarist Oleg Fomchenkov.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was founded by Oleg Fomchenkov (also known as Oleg Gitarkin) who had previously performed with Oleg Kostrov as Messer für Frau Müller. Messer Chups is often considered a \"spin-off\" band of Messer für Frau Müller. In the group's name, \"Messer\" is taken from the German word for \"knife\" and \"Chups\" from Chupa Chups lollipops.\nThe band was originally a duo of Gitarkin on bass guitar and Annette Schneider on synthesizer. During 2000–2002 Messer Chups consisted of Gitarkin and Igor Vdovin on synths.\nIn 2003, Oleg Tarasov, the producer of Messer Chups and head of their home label Solnze Records, invited the world famous theremin player Lydia Kavina to join them. Together they have released several albums and reworked their previous releases. In 2005, Messer Chups became a duo consisting of Gitarkin and Svetlana \"Zombierella\" Nagaeva on bass. In 2007, they became a trio, with drummer Denis \"Kashchey\" Kuptsov from the band Leningrad. In 2008, they changed their drummer to Alexander Belkok, and Alexander Skvortzov became their vocalist.\nThe group's music was used for the soundtrack for the dating sim Monster Prom.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nMesser Chups combines surf rock and traditional Russian music, as well as using samples from historical recordings, lounge music, and vintage film soundtracks. Their live shows feature projections of old horror and sci-fi movies. Gitarkin has cited Link Wray and The Ventures as influences.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAs of 2019, the group's line-up consisted of:\n\nOleg \"Guitaracula\" Fomchenkov (aka Oleg Gitarkin) – guitar\nSvetlana \"Zombierella\" Nagaeva – bass, vocals\nEvgeny Lomakin (aka \"Rocking Eugene\") – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums:\n\nЧудовище и Чудовище (Monster & Monster) (1999) MC, CD [Re-released as Miss Libido 2000, Monster & Monster Upgrade Version]\nНевеста Атома (Bride Of The Atom) (2000) MC, CD\nVamp Babes (2000) MC, CD [Re-released as Vamp Babes Upgrade Version]\nBlack Black Magic (2002) CD\nCrazy Price (2003) CD/LP\nHyena Safari (2005) CD/LP\nZombie Shopping (2007) CD\nHeretic Channel (2009) CD/LP\nBermuda 66 (2010) CD/LP\nSurf Riders from The Swamp Lagoon (2011) CD/LP\nChurch of Reverb (2013) CD/LP\nThe Incredible Crocotiger (2015) CD/LP\nSpooky Hook (2015) CD/LP\nTaste the Blood of Guitaracula (2017) CD/LP\nMondo Harp (2019) CD/LP\nDon't Say Cheese (2020) CD/LP\nVisiting the Skeleton in the Closet (2021) CD/LP\nDark Side of Paradise (2024) LP/CD\nEP's:\n\nTwin Peaks Twist (2019) 7\"\nJokermobile (2019) 7\"\nThe Curse of Catzilla (2020) 7\"\nNew Wave or Surf Wave (2020) LP\nNight Stripper (2023) 7\"\nBlood and Black Lace (2023) 7\"\nDon't Worry, Be Creepy!

    "text": "Dzeko & Torres was a Canadian production and DJ duo based in Toronto, Ontario. Their style was a combination of progressive house and electro, with influences from Avicii, Lazy Rich, Umek, and Alesso.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2007 - 2010 ===\nLuis Torres and Julian Dzeko met on an online forum for all-age club events in Toronto. Torres was working as a graphic designer and photographer, while Dzeko was promoting events. Both men learned to mix using FL Studio, with Torres, who taught piano before leaning to produce, also handling keyboards. They started DJing together and co-producing original material; in 2008, they released their single \"Confronted\" on DJ Chuckie’s Dirty Dutch Digital Vol. 4. Their song \"Again\" was remixed by Joe Ghost in 2010.\n\n\n=== 2012 & Hey EP ===\nBy January 2012, they had opened for a number of major touring DJs in the Greater Toronto Area, such as Sebastian Ingrosso, Hardwell, Marcus Schossow, Porter Robinson, Erick Morillo, Michael Woods and Quintino. In early 2012 they released an unofficial remix of Of Monsters And Men‘s \"King and Lionheart, which reached No. 1 on Hype Machine. Also in 2012, the duo released a remix of Trey Songz \"Heart Attack\" on Atlantic Records. By late 2012, their tracks had been played on shows such as Tiësto’s Club Life and Paul Oakenfold’s Planet Perfecto. They also premiered an unreleased track, \"Togi,\" on David Guetta's radio show Radio DJ Mix.\nTheir track \"Hey\" premiered on Steve Aoki's BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix 2012. Aoki then asked the duo to create a full EP, and that led to the three-track Hey, released on December 18, 2012, on Dim Mak Records. The EP's track \"Buppy\" first appeared on blogs in late fall of 2012; the third track was \"Check This Out\", and the EP received favourable reviews. In December 2012, they signed to the AM Only booking agency, and released an official remix of \"Strange Attractor\" by Animal Kingdom. In January 2013 the duo appeared in the web series The Aoki Files.\n\nBy the end of 2012 the band had toured in both Europe and throughout North America. In 2013, they played at The BPM Festival, the Ultra Music Festival and the Winter Music Conference. Other gigs in 2013 included the Chasing Summer Festival, the Electric Zoo Festival in New York City, Coachella, and Tomorrowland.\n\n\n=== 2013—2016 ===\n\nIn 2013, Dzeko & Torres released their collaborative single \"Togi\", with Crossways, on Monstercat. In April 2014 they were working with Tiësto's Musical Freedom label, releasing several singles. In 2014 a music video for the Tiësto and Dzeko & Torres Remix of \"Anywhere For You\" by John Martin was released on YouTube. The video shows scenes from John Martin's original video along with added footage of the DJs in action and lyrics. In February 2014 they returned to Monstercat to release their remix of Pegboard Nerds' \"Bassline Kickin'\". They continued to tour as of July 2014, performing at the Annual Summer White Party in Salt Lake City.\nIn 2016, Dzeko and Torres announced that they would be halting their partnership to focus on their solo careers.\nIn August 2020 however, Torres released his first single as a solo artist titled \"Come Down\" featuring Mkla.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n2010\n\nAlternative Reality and Christian Planes featuring Crystal – \"I Gotta Have Your Love\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\n2011\n\nJus Jack featuring Black Dogs – \"Can't Wait\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nYug featuring SoJay – \"Doin'\" (Dzeko & Torres 'What Are We' Remix)\"\n2012\n\nChuckie – \"Who Is Ready To Jump\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nAnimal Kingdom – \"Strange Attractor\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nChuckie featuring Amanda Wilson – \"Breaking Up\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\n2013\n\nSteve Aoki featuring Rob Roy – \"Ooh\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nCapital Cities – \"Safe And Sound\" (Dzeko & Torres 'Digital Dreamin' Remix)\nImagine Dragons – \"Demons\" (Dzeko & Torres 'Sunset' Remix)\n2014\n\nPegboard Nerds – \"Bassline Kickin'\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nJohn Martin – \"Anywhere For You (Tiësto vs. Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nOh Honey – \"Be Okay\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nKiesza – \"Hideaway\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nLittle Daylight – \"My Life\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nZHU – \"Faded\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nCash Cash – \"Surrender\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\n2015\n\nOdesza featuring Shy Girls – \"All We Need\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nZedd featuring Selena Gomez – \"I Want You To Know\" (Dzeko & Torres vs. Maestro Harrell Remix)\nKygo featuring Conrad Sewell – \"Firestone\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nLeona Lewis – \"Fire Under My Feet\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nThe Weeknd – \"Can't Feel My Face\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\n2016\n\nBright Lights featuring 3lau – \"Runaway\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\nDisco Killerz and Liquid Todd featuring Jimmy Gnecco – \"Stellar\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix)\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nInterviews\n\"An Interview With Dzeko & Torres\".

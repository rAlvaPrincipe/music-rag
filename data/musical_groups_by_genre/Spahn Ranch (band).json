    "text": "Spahn Ranch was an American electro-industrial group from Los Angeles. Active from 1992 to 2000, the band played a subgenre of industrial music with its fusion of electronic dance, industrial and gothic music.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 1992 in Los Angeles by Matt Green and his New York–based collaborator, Rob Morton. They collectively used the funds they had saved up to jump-start the band. Rob Morton had been Matt Green's musical partner for the 5 years prior.  That same year in 1992, they signed to Cleopatra Records and released their self-titled, four-song EP, with vocals supplied by Scott \"Chopper\" Franklin (later to become bass player for The Cramps) Scott Franklin left another band to provide vocals for Spahn Ranch.\nIn 1993, they added vocalist Athan Maroulis and recorded their debut album, Collateral Damage. Their second album, The Coiled One, appeared two years later in the midst of Morton leaving the band due to creative and logistical differences. After his departure, the line-up was expanded to include Christian Death drummer David Glass, Screams for Tina guitarist Kent Bancroft, and Tubalcain  drummer Harry Lewis. This offered a beginning of the fuller, more diverse, dark electro-industrial sound that Spahn Ranch would continue to pursue. By 1997, Spahn Ranch had pared themselves down to the three-piece unit of Green, Maroulis and Lewis.\nSpahn Ranch continued to release albums throughout the late 1990s. Architecture, released in 1997, featured contributions from Killing Joke/Prong bassist Paul Raven and Rockats/Nancy Sinatra guitarist Danny B. Harvey. This album took an even more experimental approach to the Spahn Ranch sound, incorporating elements of drum and bass, dub and for the first time, live guitar parts. Beat Noir, in 1998, followed a similar path even further and included work with Bauhaus/Love & Rockets bassist David J. The compilation Anthology 1992–1994 was released in 2000 and contained the band's first four releases in addition to previously unreleased material.\nThe band regularly toured throughout North America during their existence with the likes of Front Line Assembly, Front 242, Switchblade Symphony and Apoptygma Berzerk.  Spahn Ranch also made a couple of European treks prior to their demise as a group in 2000.\nClosure, their final album, was recorded in 2000 and released in 2001.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio Albums\n\nCollateral Damage (1993, Cleopatra)\nThe Coiled One (1995, Cleopatra)\nArchitecture (1997, Cleopatra)\nBeat Noir (1998, Out of Line/Sub/Mission)\nClosure (2001, Cleopatra)\nExtended plays\n\nSpahn Ranch (1992, Cleopatra)\nThe Blackmail Starters Kit (1994, Cleopatra)\nBreath and Taxes (1994, Zoth Ommog)\nIn Parts Assembled Solely (1996, Cleopatra)\nRetrofit EP (1998, Cleopatra)\nCompilation albums\n\nAnthology 1992–1994 (2000, Cleopatra)\nMusic videos\n\n\"Breath and Taxes\" (1993)\n\"Locusts\" (1995), directed by Joseph Kahn\nCompilation appearances\n(non-LP tracks)\n\nThe Whip – \"Machine Politics (Original Version)\" (1993) Cleopatra, US (CD and cassette) / Music Research, Germany / Jungle Records, UK (CD only)\nMysterious Encounters – \"Antibody (Alternate Mix)\" (1994) Cleopatra, US (CD and cassette)\nIndustrial Revolution Second Edition – \"Succumber (Blacklist)\" (1994) Cleopatra, US (CD)\nBody Rapture Volume 4 – \"Succumber (Blacklist)\" (1994) Zoth Ommog, Germany (CD)\nA Saucerful of Pink – \"One of These Days\" (1995) Cleopatra, US / Cherry Red Records, UK (CD)\nThe Digital Space Between Vol 2 – \"Forceps (Fezmix)\" (1995,)Cleopatra, US / Hard Records, Denmark (CD)\nThere Is No Time – \"One of These Days (different mix)\" (1995) Ras Dva, US (CD)\nIndustrial Revolution Third Edition – \"Vortex (Extended Mix)\" (1996) Cleopatra, US (CD)\nVertigo Compilation 3 1996 – \"Locusts (Pygmy Children Mix)\" (1996) Germany (promo-only CD available with Vertigo magazine)\nCovered in Black – \"Shot Down in Flames\" (1997) Cleopatra, US / RCA Victor, Japan / Zebra-Cherry Red Records, UK (CD)\nUltimate Drum 'N' Bass – \"The Mark Inside\" (1997) Hypnotic, US (CD)\nElectronic Lust v. 1 – \"In the Aftermath (Astralasia Mix 2)\" (1998) Orkus, Germany (CD)\nHymns of the Warlock – \"Dig It\" (1998) Cleopatra, US (CD)\nThe Black Bible – \"An Exit (Alternate Mix)\" (1999) Cleopatra, US (CD)\nVirgin Voices – \"Swim\" (1999) Cleopatra, US / RCA Victor, Japan (CD)\nWe Will Follow – \"I Will Follow\" 1999, Cleopatra, US / Anagram Records, UK (CD)\nAwake the Machines Vol. 2 – \"Remnants (CKultur Mutation mix)\" (1999) Out of Line, Germany (CD)\nDarken My Fire – \"Strange Days\" (2000) Cleopatra, US / EMI, Japan / Anagram Records, UK (CD)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMTV biography\nSpahn Ranch at Bandcamp\nSpahn Ranch at iTunes\nSpahn Ranch discography at Discogs \nSpahn Ranch discography at MusicBrainz"

The group created dance-friendly remixes of familiar songs, as well as produced music for a number of musicians and bands, including the Juno-awarded Deeper Shade of Love by Camille.\nTheir debut album, Greatest Hits Volume One, was released in 1999 and produced the hit \"Squeeze Toy\" as well as \"Pictures\", both performed by Kim Esty. Greatest Hits did well in Canada, achieving gold status in sales. The single \"Popcorn\" appeared on the RPM dance chart in 1999. The group also produced \"The Hampsterdance Song\", a track based on the Hampster Dance meme; the song reached number one on Nielsen SoundScan's Canadian Singles Chart in mid-2000. \"Squeeze Toy\" and \"Movin' On\", a single from 2002, topped this chart as well.

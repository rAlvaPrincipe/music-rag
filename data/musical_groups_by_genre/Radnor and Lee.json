It was their \"shared interest in spirituality and philosophy\" that inspired them make music together in the first place, with producer Ryan Dilmore referring to the pair as “singer-psalmwriters.” The two describe their vision for Radnor and Lee as \"trying to write from the perspective of people who've had a little life under their belts... a different level of reflection and wisdom and humility...

    "text": "Other Dimensions in Music is an American free jazz group founded in the 1980s.\nThe group is a collective quartet composed of trumpeter Roy Campbell, multi-instrumentalist Daniel Carter, bassist William Parker and drummer Rashid Bakr. Campbell, Parker and Bakr began working together as members of Jemeel Moondocâ€˜s group Muntu. Other Dimensions In Music came into existence when Carter joined them in 1981. Their third album, Time is of the Essence is Beyond Time is a live collaboration with pianist Matthew Shipp. On their next recording, Live at the Sunset, drummer Hamid Drake replaces Bakr. Kaiso Stories finds the quartet backing vocalist Fay Victor.\nThe group's music is entirely improvised but is generally more melodic than some listeners expect from free jazz.\n\n\n== Members ==\nRashid Bakr (drums)\nRoy Campbell Jr. (trumpet)\nDaniel Carter (saxophones, flute)\nWilliam Parker (double bass)\n\n\n=== Guest musicians ===\nMatthew Shipp (piano)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nOther Dimensions In Music (Silkheart, 1990)\nNow!

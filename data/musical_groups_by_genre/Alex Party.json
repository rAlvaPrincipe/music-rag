    "text": "Alex Party is an Italian electronic dance group. The band consisted of the Italian brothers Paolo and Gianni Visnadi (also of Livin' Joy), DJ Alex Natale, and vocalist, singer and songwriter Shanie Campbell.\nTheir most famous single to date is \"Don't Give Me Your Life\", a #2 hit in both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom in early 1995. The group's first single, \"Saturday Night Party (Read My Lips)\", was an immediate success, and became an Ibiza anthem during the summer of 1993. It became their first Top 40 hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at #29.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== \"Don't Give Me Your Life\" ===\n\nThey released the single \"Don't Give Me Your Life\" in 1994, being an extended remix to the original \"Alex Party\" track. It reached #2 in both Ireland and the United Kingdom (their highest charting hit in those countries), #5 on the US Dance charts, and #13 in Australia, plus it topped and made the No 1 position and was Club Record of the year at  Music Week's 1995 Awards.\n\n\n=== Other releases ===\nA follow-up single to the multi-named \"Alex Party / Saturday Night Party / Read My Lips\" single was released entitled \"Alex Party 2\" but was only available on 12\" Vinyl. It was relatively unknown as it received little to no promotion. The track, along with the same remixes as on the vinyl release was included on a special Singapore CD Single of \"Don't Give Me Your Life\".\nThe group continued to have moderate success following the success of \"Don't Give Me Your Life\", including \"Wrap Me Up\", which was released in late 1995, peaking at #17 in the UK and #11 in Australia (where it was the group's last charting single).\nA revamped version of the first single was released in 1996 that included added vocals by Shanie and was entitled \"Read My Lips\". It reached #28 in the UK chart. Same year an official 'Megamix' single was released including \"Don't Give Me Your Life\", \"Read My Lips\", \"Simple Things\", and \"Wrap Me Up\".\nIn 1997, \"Simple Things\" was the next single to be released and it achieved moderate sales.\nIn 1999 \"Don't Give Me Your Life\" was re-released which included new mixes and a full-length bonus track Megamix from 1996.\nAlthough the last single which was released in the year 2000 was \"U Gotta Be\" a rare, unreleased, and virtually unknown track entitled \"You Can't Escape My Love\" appeared on a Portuguese compilation album, named Top Star 2001, on the Vidisco record label.\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nAlongside releasing singles, Alex Natale was assisted by the Visnadi brothers to remix tracks for many artists. Notable artists remixed include 2 Unlimited, The Shamen, Jinny, Clubzone, Alison Limerick, Everything but the Girl, and Gipsy.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlex Party discography at Discogs"

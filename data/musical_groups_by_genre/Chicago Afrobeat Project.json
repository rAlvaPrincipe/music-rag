    "text": "Chicago Afrobeat Project (CAbP) is a seven- to 14-piece world music ensemble with influences including afrobeat, hip hop, funk, jazz, jùjú music, and rock. The members are well versed in afrobeat, the musical style of Fela Kuti and Tony Allen, and use it as a jumping off point to explore other styles. Based in Chicago, the band began in 2002 in a loft at 657 West Lake Street. The group is sometimes accompanied by African dancers from Chicago's Muntu Dance Theatre as well as Ayodele Drum & Dance. The group has released five studio efforts between 2005-2017, all recorded at Fullerton Recording Studios. In the summers of 2013 and 2014, the band collaborated with Fela Kuti's original drummer, Tony Allen, for a series of performances and recording sessions at Fullerton Recording Studios with the resulting work featured on the album What Goes Up (2017). \n\n\n== Members ==\nDavid Glines - Guitar\nKevin Ford - Keyboards, Studio Shaman\nGarrick Smith  - Baritone Saxophone\nAngelo Garcia - Tenor Saxophone\nRyan Tedder - Tenor Saxophone, Baritone Saxophone, Keyboards, Guitar\nMark Thomson - Trombone\nXavier Galdon - Trombone\nParris Fleming - Trumpet\nDanjuma Gaskin - Percussion\nLuc Parcell - Bass\nChadwick - Painter (select shows)\nTJ Okulnola - Talking Drum (select shows)\nTosha Alston - Dancer (select shows)\nImania Detry - Dancer (select shows)\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2017 - Chicago Tribune (Greg Kot) Top 10 Chicago Indie Releases of 2017\n2017 - Winner, Best African Artist: Chicago Music Awards\n2014 - Best International/World Music Act: Chicago Reader's \"Best of Chicago 2014\n2014 - Winner, Best African Entertainer: Chicago Music Awards\n2013 - Tied for Runner-Up, Best International/World Music Act: Chicago Reader's \"Best of Chicago 2013\"\n2013 - Rhapsody Music Top 25 World Music Albums (Nyash UP!)\n2012 - Winner, Best African Artist: Chicago Music Awards\n2011 - Winner, Best African Artist: Chicago Music Awards\n2010 - Winner, Best African Artist: Chicago Music Awards\n2009 - Winner, Best African Artist: Chicago Music Awards\n2008 - Winner, Best African Artist: Chicago Music Awards\n2006 - Nominated for Chicago Music Award's \"Award of Honor for Contribution to World beat Music\"\n2005 - Nominated Best African Artist: Chicago Music Awards\n2004 - Nominated Best African Artist: Chicago Music Awards\n\n\n== Selected festivals ==\nHyde Park Jazz Festival (2017)\nChicago World Music Festival (2003, 2006, 2013, 2015)\nUtah Arts Festival - Salt Lake City, UT (2008, 2012)\nCIMMfest (Chicago International Movies & Music Festival) - Chicago, IL (2016)\nSummerfest - Milwaukee, WI (2014, 2015)\nNorth Coast Music Festival Official After Party (with Tony Allen) - Chicago, IL (2014)\nBear Creek Music Festival - Live Oak, FL (2008)\nHigh Sierra Music Festival (2007, 2008)\nWakarusa Music Festival (2006, 2008)\nDetroit Concert of Colors - Detroit, MI (2014)\nBoogie on the Bricks - Athens, OH (2016)\nEvanston Ethnic Arts & Music Festival - Evanston, IL (2016)\nCelebrate Clark Street - Chicago, IL (2007, 2008, 2016)\nGreen Eggs & Jam - Leavenworth, KS (2015)\nMerchant Street Music Festival - Kankakee, IL (2015)\nLogan Square Arts Festival - Chicago, IL (2015)\nFelabration - Denver, CO (2014)\nDeschutes Brewery Warehouse Party - Bend, OR (2014)\nSweet Pea Festival - Bozeman, MT (2014)\nAnn Arbor Summer Festival - Ann Arbor, MI (2014)\nArcadia Creek Festival Place - Kalamazoo, MI (2014)\nReggae in the Mountains - Ketchum, ID (2013)\nWindy City Ribfest - Chicago, IL (2013)\nArtoberfest - Benton Harbor, MI (2013)\nAndersonville Midsommarfest - Chicago, IL (2012)\nGroovefest - Cedar City, UT (2012)\nDubuquefest - Dubuque, IA (2012)\nStarwood Festival (2011)\nTraverse City Summer Microbrew and Music Festival - Traverse City, MI (2010)\nCamp Euforia - Lone Tree, IA (2007, 2010, 2020)\nMid Summer Meltdown Music Festival - Kempton, PA (2010)\nTruckee Reggae Fest - Truckee, CA (2009)\nTaste of Chicago - Chicago, IL (2009)\nBele Chere Music Festival (2005, 2006)\nChicago's Summer Dance Series (2005, 2007, 2010)\nSummer Camp Festival (2005, 2007, 2008)\nVassar College Jazz Festival (2005, 2006)\n\n\n== Guest musicians ==\n\n\n=== Live ===\nTony Allen - (2013, 2014, 2018)\nSugar Blue - (2013)\nJC Brooks - (2013, 2017)\nAkenya - (2017)\nKiara Lanier (2017)\nUgochi (2008, 2011, 2017)\nSahr from FELA! on Broadway - 2012\nJeff Parker from Tortoise\nHoward Levy\nBobby Broom\nFareed Haque\nPaul Wertico\nDave Watts from The Motet\n\n\n=== Recordings ===\nTony Allen (2017)\nUgochi (2007,2009,2017)\nBobby Broom (2007)\nFareed Haque (2005)\nJ.C.

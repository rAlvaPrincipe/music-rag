    "text": "The Universal Zulu Nation is an international hip hop awareness group formed by electro/hip hop artist Afrika Bambaataa.: 101 \nAccording to the website of the UZN, the Zulu Nation stands for \"knowledge, wisdom, understanding, freedom, justice, equality, peace, unity, love, respect, work, fun, overcoming the negative to the positive, economics, mathematics, science, life, truth, facts, faith, and the oneness of god\".\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally known simply as the Organization, it arose in the 1970s from the reformed New York City gang the Black Spades, a street gang from the South Bronx. While the Black Spades were the base of the organization, other reformed gangs contributed additional members, notably the Savage Nomads, Seven Immortals, and Savage Skulls, among others. Members began to organize cultural events for youths, combining local dance and music movements into what would become known as the various elements of hip hop culture. Elements of the culture include Emceeing (MCing), Deejaying (DJing), breaking (Breakdancing), and writing (Graffiti).\nIn many interviews, Afrika Bambaataa has spoken of the name \"Zulu\" as being inspired by the 1964 film of the same name.\nThe imagery of the Zulu Nation has varied at times as well. During the 1970s and the 1980s, Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation members would often clothe themselves in costumes representing different cultures of the world.\nSince the early 1980s, the Zulu Nation has established autonomous branches in Japan, France, the UK, Australia, Canada, South Korea and the Cape Flats in Cape Town South Africa.\nFrom the late 1980s, at the height of the Afrocentric movement in Hip Hop (when artists such as KRS-One, Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest, Native Tongues, and Rakim hit success), the movement seemed to be incorporating many doctrines from the Nation of Islam, the Nation of Gods and Earths, and the Nuwaubians. In the mid-1990s, some members began to break off starting their own projects or organizations such as \"Ill Crew Universal\".\nAfrika Bambaataa stood down as head of the Zulu Nation in May 2016 after allegations of sexually abusing several young men and children in the organization. Ronald Savage was the first of several men to publicly accuse Bambaataa.\nIn 2017, hundreds of Zulus resigned due to distrust of the Zulu Nation and founded their own organization, the Zulu Union.\n\n\n== Zulu Nation in France ==\nThe Zulu movement was introduced to France in 1982 by Afrika Bambaataa when the New York City Rap Tour performed in several cities (Paris, Lyon, Metz, Belfort, Mulhouse) with artists PHASE 2, Futura 2000, Dondi, Grandmaster D.ST, the Rock Steady Crew, Rammellzee, the double dutch group Buffalo Girls. The Zulu Nation was centered in suburban Paris since most immigrants lived beyond the city limits. Since 1987, the Zulu Nation's ties to the French hip hop community have waned. Since Afrika Bambaataa's tour of France in 2008 and a Zulu Nation reunion in Paris, new movements of the Universal Zulu Nation have emerged in different cities in France.  According to Veronique Henelon, \"French rap specifically has been a multi-dimensional expression of ties with Africa.\" The first Hip Hop television show reportedly appeared in France. It was called 'H.I.P. H.O.P.' and was aired by the TF1 channel in 1984.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn 2004, the thirteenth episode of the second season of Chappelle's Show had the comedian Dave Chappelle do a sketch on an African-American George W. Bush, called Black Bush, where the character said that his coalition of the willing included Afrika Bambataa and the Zulu Nation.\nThe Universal Zulu Nation is featured at length in the 2016 Netflix series The Get Down. In the series, Afrika Bambaataa is played by Nigerian-American actor Okieriete Onaodowan.\n\n\n== Notable members and affiliates ==\nJoeystarr\nMike Gee\nSammy B\nAfrika Baby Bam\nQ-Tip\nAli Shaheed Muhammad\nJarobi White\nPosdnuos\nTrugoy\nMaseo\nMonie Love\nQueen Latifah\nDres\nMista Lawnge\nTorch\nFab Five Freddy\nKurtis Blow\nRussell Simmons\nSpoonie Gee\nRakaa\nKool Moe Dee\nIce-T\nKing Sun XL\nImmortal Technique\nBig Boi\nFreddie Gibbs\n9th Wonder\nChief Keef\nDarryl McDaniels\nJoseph Simmons\nWiz Khalifa\nTyler, the Creator\nLeft Brain\nJasper Dolphin\nHodgy\nSyd\nDomo Genesis\nTaco\nEarl Sweatshirt\nFrank Ocean\nL-Boy\nMatt Martians\nCasey Veggies\nChi-Ali\nLovebug Starski (deceased)\nJam Master Jay (deceased)\nPhife Dawg (deceased)\nLil Wayne (reportedly)\nZulu King Flowrex\nDJ Fuze (Councillor Richard MacRae)\nMC Spice\nMick Benzo\nSol Messiah\nBronx Style Bob\nPetawane\nDeph Paul\nMakakuvu Ali El Bey\nCaslu\nPhase 2 (deceased)\nDondi (deceased)\nPrince Whipper Whip\nLord-Yoda-X (deceased)\nFutura 2000\nKRS-One\nFat Joe\nIce Cube\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nUniversal Zulu Nation Holland\nUniversal Zulu Nation Australia\nUniversal Zulu Nation Malta\n\"Zulu Nation: From Gang To Glory\", by Davey D"

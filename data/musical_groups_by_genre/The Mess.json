The three-member jury made up of La Fouine, Alexia Laroche-Joubert and Philippe Gandilhon opted for The Mess, which consists of Megan, Léa, Chéraze and Kendy.\nPrior to their third single \"Je t'attendrai encore\", Kendy left the band. Originally scheduled for 6 October 2014, The Mess' debut album has finally been cancelled by their label Columbia/Sony Music and The Mess split amicably.\nThe group was awarded a record deal that includes at least a debut single and a studio album. The debut single of the winning formation was \"Au top\" written by Maître Gims and Renaud Rebillaud. It entered the French SNEP official singles chart at number 34 the week following the finale. Their second single has been Honneur aux dames, that featured French rapper Canardo, but failed to chart.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== After the Mess ==\nChéraze, after breaking up from The Mess continued on a solo career with a hit in 2015 entitled \"Promets pas la lune\" charting in SNEP, the official French Singles Chart.

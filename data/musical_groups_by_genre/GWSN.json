    "text": "GWSN (Korean: 공원소녀; RR: Gongwon Sonyeo), also known as Girls in the Park, was a South Korean girl group formed in 2018 by Kiwi Pop (now known as The Wave Music). The group consisted of seven members: Miya, Seokyoung, Seoryoung, Anne, Minju, Soso, and Lena, and debuted on September 5, 2018 with the title track \"Puzzle Moon\" from their extended play The Park in the Night Part One.\n\n\n== Name ==\nGWSN is an abbreviation of Gongwon Sonyeo. The group describes \"gongwon\" (lit. park) as a place \"where anyone, who is male or female or old or young, can go and enjoy themselves, heal their wounds and dream\". The abbreviation also has a separate meaning in English, with G standing for 'Ground' and WSN standing for the directional markers 'West,' 'South,' and 'North,' with the significance being that the group wants to reach out to people from every direction. 'Gong-won' can also be translated into 'gong,' meaning zero in Korean, and 'won,' which represents the English word one, meaning that when the seven members get together, they will forever be one.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2018–2019: Debut with The Park in the Night series ===\nOn June 14, 2018, Kiwi Pop, a subsidiary of Kiwi Media Group, released a teaser image for their first girl group named GWSN and the opening of their social media accounts with their reveal date set to June 18, 2018.

The band was the first act signed to the label besides Black himself. Carolina Rain released its debut single, \"I Ain't Scared\", which reached No. 41 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Following it were two additional singles, \"Louisiana Love\", and \"Let's Get It On\". \"Louisiana Love\" failed to chart, and \"Let's Get It On\" reached No. 57. However, those songs were never included on an album. Then in 2006, the group released \"Get Outta My Way\". Co-written by Robert Ellis Orrall and Curtis Wright, this song became their first Top 40 country hit, peaking at No. 28. After its release came their debut album Weather the Storm, which also included \"I Ain't Scared\". After \"Get Outta My Way\" came their highest-charting single in the No. 26 \"Isn't She\", followed by the non-charting \"Dealin'\".\n\n\n=== American Radio ===\nIn late 2008, the group released a new single titled \"American Radio\". The single intended to be the lead-off to a second studio album of the same name. The song reached No. 53 on the country charts a few weeks after its release. A second single from the album, \"Weight of the World\" was released, but Equity closed in December 2008.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References =="

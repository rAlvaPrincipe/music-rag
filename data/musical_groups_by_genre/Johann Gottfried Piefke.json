In the 1850s, he was band leader for the 8th Infantry Regiment in Berlin. His famous marches include Preußens Gloria, Düppeler Schanzen-Marsch and the Königgrätzer Marsch – the latter composed after the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866, the decisive battle of the Austro-Prussian War). He arranged Franz Liszt's symphonic poem – Tasso for military band and may also have similarly arranged some of Liszt's marches.  He died in Frankfurt an der Oder.\nPiefke also wrote:\n\nPochhammer Marsch\nSiegesmarsch\nGitana Marsch\nMargarethen Marsch\nKaiser-Wilhelm-Siegesmarsch\nDer Alsenströmer, a march commemorating the Battle of Als during the Second Schleswig War.\nDer Lymfjordströmer, another march commemorating the Danish War.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nPiefke received the following medals:\n\nDüppeler-Sturmkreuz, 1864\nGolden Medal of the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, 1865\nRoyal Order of the House of Hohenzollern, 1869\nIron Cross Second Class, 1870\nPrussian Crown Order, 1880\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\"Piefke\" persists as a derogatory nickname for Germans in Austria.\nPiefke's Königgrätzer Marsch can be heard playing during the book burning scene in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

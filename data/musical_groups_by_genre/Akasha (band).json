Their first track appeared on a DJ Bizzniss EP, released on Payday Recordings. The track was then licensed through Pressure Drop, who recommended them to Wall Of Sound.

Appearances on various compilations followed, and the release of their first album, Cinematique, in 1998, including guest appearances from Neneh Cherry and Maxi Jazz.\nAkasha then toured Belgium, France and Germany.

    "text": "The Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra (名古屋フィルハーモニー交響楽団, Nagoya Firuhāmonī Kōkyō Gakudan) is a symphony orchestra based in Nagoya, Japan, founded in 1966.  The orchestra gives concerts primarily at the Aichi Prefectural Arts Theater Concert Hall and the Chukyo University Center for Culture & Arts Aurora Hall.\nThe orchestra gave their first subscription concert in October 1967.  In 1971, Hiroyuki Iwaki became the orchestra's first general music director, with the parallel appointment of Yoshikazu Fukumura as 'permanent conductor'.  This dual arrangement of conductors continued until the tenure of Yuzo Toyama as both general music director and permanent conductor from 1981 to 1987, the only conductor in the history of the orchestra to hold both titles.  During the tenure of Ken-Ichiro Kobayashi, the title of General Music Director was changed to Music Director, effective 2001.  The title of permanent conductor was discontinued, and the post of chief conductor was instituted, starting with Ryusuke Numajiri in 2003.\nThe orchestra's current chief conductor is Martyn Brabbins, who was named to the post in December 2011 and formally took up the chief conductorship with the 2013-2014 season.  Thierry Fischer, chief conductor from April 2008 through February 2011, now has the title of honorary guest conductor.  The orchestra's honorary conductor since 1993 is Moshe Atzmon, who was permanent conductor from 1987 to 1993.  Kobayashi has held the title of conductor laureate since 2003.  As of October 2013, the orchestra has Masahiko Enkoji as its Resident Conductor and Kentaro Kawase as its Conductor.\n\n\n== General Music Directors/Music Directors ==\nHiroyuki Iwaki (1971-1974)\nTadashi Mori (1974-1980)\nYuzo Toyama (1981-1987)\nKen-Ichiro Kobayashi (General Music Director, 1998-2001; Music Director, 2001-2003)\n\n\n== Conductors ==\nKenichi Kiyota (1966-1973)\nHiroyuki Iwaki (1971-1973)\nYoshikazu Fukumura (1971-1974)\nToshio Ukai (1972)\nTadahi Mori (1974-1980)\nShunji Aratani (1974-1980)\nYuzo Toyama (1981-1987)\nTaizo Takemoto (1981-1983)\nJyunichi Hirokami (1983-1984)\nKenichiro Kobayashi (1984- )\nKouki Tezuka (1984-1989)\n\nMoshe Atzmon (1987-1993)\nTaijiro Iimori (1993-1998)\nRyusuke Numajiri (2003-2006)\nThierry Fischer (2008-2011)\nMasahiko Enkoji (2011- )\nMartyn Brabbins (2013-2016)\nKazuhiro Koizumi (2016- )\n\n\n== External links ==\nNagoya Philharmonic Orchestra English-language home page\n\"Martyn Brabbins moves to NPO\".

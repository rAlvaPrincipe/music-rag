The band announced through their official Twitter account \"here's some news - its gonna be our second last show ever.\" on Tuesday 28 August.\nThey posted an official statement on 29 August on their website stating reasons for the breaking up including \"Sometimes it’s pretty tiring being in a band. I know to people that haven’t ever been in a band that might sound a bit self piteous and indulgent, but it is hard. Playing to no one, having higher expectations for your music than what is met, the fact that it is nearly impossible to make it a career in Australia as a musician (it is a big big country, with not many people and one very fickle national radio station) all these things can grate away at you.\"\nThey announced that they would play one last show in Sydney before the end of 2012.\n\n\n== Since disbanding ==\nSince The Paper Scissors disbanded- members Jai Pyne and Ivan Lisyak have remained active in the music scene in Sydney. Ivan Lisyak has played with Philadelphia Grand Jury, Tanned Christ, Jack Colwell, Post Paint and Marcus Whale, as well as making music as HVISKE with Sydney artist/singer Kusum Normoyle. Jai Pyne formed a record label called Turktown with fellow musician and producer Caleb Jacobs and released a solo EP called 'Jaisus' in 2015.

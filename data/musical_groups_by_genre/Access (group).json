    "text": "Access (also known as AXS) is a Japanese pop group. Its members are Daisuke Asakura and Hiroyuki Takami. Asakura is the primary composer/producer and featured keyboardist while Takami is the vocalist. Takami also writes a major portion of access' lyrics. Access is currently signed with Sony Music Associated Records. The name \"access\" is stylized in lowercase letters.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccess was formed after Hiroyuki Takami performed in some of Daisuke Asakura's solo work as a guest vocalist in 1991. The unit's career officially began in 1992. The duo went on to record three albums and attain significant popularity before announcing their breakup in 1995 for ambiguous reasons. In 2002, however, they reunited with much fanfare, and have remained active since.\n\"AXS\" is their written nickname. While spelled \"AXS\", it is actually not an \"X\" but two inwardly-turned arrows (\"A-><-S\"). The nickname was coined by Takami. It first appeared on the group's debut album, Fast Access, on the last page of the lyrics book. \"AXS\" replaced the group's name on their third single \"Naked Desire.\" The logo has many variations depending on its use. There is only one album that has \"AXS\" credited as the group's name: AXS Remix Best Tracks. In all of their albums from 1993 to 1995 song production was credited as \"songs by AXS\". Before their reunion in 2002, the logo and nickname have not been used, except as credits for remixed songs on the album and tour DVDs of \"Crossbridge\". In 2006, for the \"blanc and rouge\" tour, \"AXS\" reappeared in the tour logo interwoven in the design of a coat of arms.\nIn 2007, after the Virginia Tech massacre, access produced the song \"Shadow over the world\" in dedication to the memory of the victims. The song was released on the album \"binary engine\" and had its live debut during their summer tour of that same year.\nAccess performed the opening theme for Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion Stages 24 & 25, \"Hitomi no Tsubasa\", and did the third opening theme for D.Gray-Man, \"Doubt & Trust\" (2007). In July 2008, their single \"Dream Runner\" was featured as the opening theme of the TV drama series, Here is Greenwood. In 2009, Access was indirectly featured in a musical rendition of Goodbye Charlie with Takami portraying one of the lead roles and Asakura having composed and directed the music. Their single \"Bet～追憶のRoulette～\" was featured as an ending theme for Fuji TV's series Sukimono from 30 July 2012 to 27 August 2012. Access was also featured in Fuji TV's event live, \"FNSうたの夏まつり\" (\"FNS Summer Festival of Song\" - 8 August 2012) doing a cover of TM Network's song, \"Be Together\", with Tetsuya Komuro.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n[26 November 1992] Virgin Emotion\nVirgin Emotion\nBe Nude\n[25 January 1993] Jewelry Angel\nJewelry Angel\nAgainst The Rules\nVirgin Emotion(Instrumental Mix)\n[26 May 1993] Naked Desire\nNaked Desire\nEvery Time You\nJewelry Angel (Instrumental Mix)\n[25 August 1993] Moonshine Dance\nMoonshine Dance\nLyin' Eyes\nNaked Desire (Instrumental Mix)\n[8 December 1993] Try Again\nTry Again\nJungling Party\nMoonshine Dance (Instrumental Mix)\n[26 January 1994] 夢を見たいから (Yume Wo Mitaikara)\n夢を見たいから\nUs\nTry Again (Instrumental Mix)\n[27 April 1994] Misty Heartbreak\nMisty Heartbreak\nStoned Merge\n夢を見たいから (Instrumental Mix)\n[25 May 1994] Sweet Silence\nSweet Silence\nDecade & XXX\n[19 August 1994] Drastic Mermaid\nDrastic Mermaid\nSequence Meditation～超電導思考回路　第一楽章　覚醒\nSweet Silence (Instrumental Mix)\n[25 August 1994] Drastic Mermaid Re-sync Style\n[19 October 1994] Scandalous Blue\nScandalous Blue\nSequence Meditation～超電導思考回路　第二楽章　混乱\nDrastic Mermaid (Instrumental Mix)\n[26 October 1994] Scandalous Blue Re-sync Style\n[7 December 1994] Tear's Liberation\nTear's Liberation\nSequence Meditation～超電導思考回路　第三楽章　解放\nScandalous Blue (Instrumental Mix)\n[14 December 1994] Tear's Liberation Re-sync Style\n[23 January 2002] Only the love survive\nOnly the love survive\nLook-a-Head <from Live before next at Yokohama Arena 1994 December 19>\n[27 February 2002] Edge\nEdge\nEspecially Kiss\n[19 February 2003] Real at Night ～眠れぬ夜の向こうに～ (Real at Night ~Nemurenu Yoru No Muko Ni~)\nReal at Night ～眠れぬ夜の向こうに～\n[31 January 2007] Diamond Cycle\nStay\nBright Sight\nInner Cycle\nCatch the Rainbow\n[18 July 2007] 瞳ノ翼 (Hitomi No Tsubasa)\n瞳ノ翼\n瞳ノ翼（TV size version）\n瞳ノ翼（Instrumental）\n[31 October 2007] Doubt & Trust　～ダウト＆トラスト～\nDoubt & Trust　～ダウト＆トラスト～\nGonna Be\nDoubt & Trust ～ダウト&トラスト～　（Instrumental）\n[27 August 2008] Dream Runner\nDream Runner\nParadise\nDream Runner (TV version)\nDream Runner (Instrumental)\n[28 July 2010] Higher Than Dark Sky\nVersion A\nHigher Than Dark Sky\nアオイナミ (Aoi Nami)\nSOUL DYNAMITE\nVersion B\nHigher Than Dark Sky\nSOUL DYNAMITE (original live)\nアオイナミ (original live)\n[3 August 2011] Share The Love\nVersion A\nShare The Love\nKEEP IT\nRide Up for the Shiny Way\nVersion B\nShare The Love\nKEEP IT (2010 Version)\nHigher Than Dark Sky (Piano Version)\n[4 April 2012] Wild Butterfly\nWild Butterfly\nBeyond the Second-D.\nChaOs GrAdatioN\n[11 July 2012] Bet～追憶のRoulette～\nBet～追憶のRoulette～\nLet Me Go\nBet～追憶のRoulette～ (Instrumental)\n[8 May 2013] 永遠dive\n[17 July 2013] JOY TRAIN\n[9 July 2014] Vertical Innocence\n[8 April 2015] IZASUSUME!\n[21 October 2015] Winter Ring Affair\n[23 November 2016] 24sync\n[24 May 2017] Knock beautiful smile\n[21 July 2024] arc jump'n to the sky\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n[25 April 1993] Fast Access\nSensual Glide\nVirgin Emotion\nPale Blue Rain\nJewelry Angel (Deep AXS Mix)\nDistance~Motomeauniwa Tosugite~\nHot Cruising Night (Original AXS)\nAgainst the Rules\nCan-Dee Graffiti\nBe Nude\nPerfect Timing\nLook-A-Head\n[22 September 1993] ACCESS II\nNIGHT WAVE (ORIGINAL AXS VERSION)\nNAKED DESIRE (THE ENTERPRISE MIX)\nMOONSHINE DANCE (THE ENTERPRISE MIX)\nI SING EVERY SHINE FOR YOU\nJUNGLING PARTY\nLYIN' EYES (THE ENTERPRISE MIX)\nREALTIME LOVER\nENDLESS SUMMER 〜君が滲んだ夏 (Kimi ga Nijinda Natsu)〜\nMARMALADE DAYS\nJULIET\nS-MILE GENERATION\n[25 May 1994] DELICATE PLANET\nSilver Heart\nMisty Heartbreak -West Side Mix-\nYume wo mitai kara -West Side Mix-\nStay My Love\nStoned Merge -West Side Mix-\nPink Junktion\nRegret\nDecade & XXX\nSweet Silence -West Side Mix-\nTry Again -West Side Mix-\nFind New Way\nBeat Planet\n[15 March 1995] Live Ones Sync -

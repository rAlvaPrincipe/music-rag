    "text": "Mizuki Sano (佐野 瑞樹, Sano Mizuki, born September 26, 1973 in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka, Japan) is a Japanese actor and the eldest member of Johnny's Jr., the trainee unit of the well-known talent agency Johnny & Associates. He is perhaps best known for his role in Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo and his various activities as a member of Johnny's Jr.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMizuki Sano graduated from Fujinomiya West High School, and Shizuoka University with a degree in law. He has a younger brother, Daiki Sano, who is also an actor. Mizuki Ashiya and Izumi Sano, the two main characters in the manga Hanazakari no Kimitachi e, are named after him.\nHe left Johnny & Associates on December 31, 2018.\n\n\n== Work ==\nMizuki Sano joined Johnny's in 1991. In 1993, he became a member of the short-lived Johnny's unit J-Eleven and also a member of KinKi Jr., a back-up group for KinKi Kids. In 1995, Sano became a first-generation member of Johnny's Sr., along with Masayuki Sakamoto, Hiroshi Nagano, and Yoshihiko Inohara of V6. Until 1996 he was a back-up dancer for Hikaru Genji, V6, SMAP, and KinKi Kids.\nUnlike most of his contemporaries in Johnny's, Sano had never graduated from Junior status until he left the management of Johnny's. He now mainly performs as a stage actor.\n\nUnnan no Sekai Seifuku Sengen (1994)\nAji Ichi Monme (TV Asahi, 1995) - Yuusuke\nSALE!

    "text": "Oysterband (originally The Oyster Band) is a British folk rock and folk punk band formed in Canterbury around 1976.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe band formed in parallel to Fiddler's Dram, and under the name \"Oyster Ceilidh Band\" played purely as a dance band at first. The name Oyster comes from the group's early association with the coastal town of Whitstable, Kent, known for the quality of its oysters. Their first album, released under the Oyster Ceilidh Band name, was Jack's Alive (1980) on the Dingles record label. Subsequent albums, as \"Oyster Band\" (sometimes \"The Oyster Band\") were released on the band's own Pukka Music label: English Rock 'n' Roll: The Early Years 1800–1850 and Lie Back and Think of England, followed by 20 Golden Tie-Slackeners and Liberty Hall.\nThe line-up of the band changed over these albums. The first recorded line-up was:\n\nCathy Lesurf – vocals;\nJohn Jones – melodeon, vocals;\nAlan Prosser – guitars, violin;\nChris Taylor – guitar, bouzouki, harmonica, one-row melodeon, mandola;\nIan Telfer – violin, English concertina, saxophone;\nChris Wood – bass guitar;\nWill Ward – bassoon, recorders, crumhorn, keyboards\nWhen Chris Wood left the band to go travelling in Canada, he was replaced on bass guitar by returning founder member Ian Kearey. Cathy Lesurf subsequently left to join Ashley Hutchings' Albion Band, and Will Ward also departed so that by the time they recorded Lie Back and Think of England, the personnel had settled down to John Jones, Ian Kearey, Alan Prosser, Chris Taylor and Ian Telfer. For the album Step Outside they added Russell Lax on drums. Step Outside mixed self-penned songs, often with a political theme, with reworkings of traditional standards such as \"Hal-an-Tow\".\n\n\n=== Later history ===\n\nAfter the 1987 release Wide Blue Yonder Kearey left the band to be replaced by Chopper (real name Ray Cooper). Subsequent albums included Ride, Little Rock to Leipzig and the June Tabor collaboration Freedom and Rain. Following this the band changed its name to Oysterband. Drummer Lee Partis (who for several years was billed only by his forename) replaced Russell Lax for 1992's Deserters before Holy Bandits in 1993 propelled the band to the forefront of a booming folk rock scene alongside bands such as The Levellers.\nIn the 1990s, the band adopted a more overtly political stance, recording the harder The Shouting End of Life and collaborating with Chumbawamba to record \"Farewell to the Crown\", released as the B-side of the \"Tubthumping\" single. But recent releases Deep Dark Ocean, Here I Stand, Rise Above and Meet You There have seen the band return to a softer, more melodic sound, while recent tours under the banner The Big Session have seen the band offer exposure to several young, emerging folk musicians like Dan Donnelly, The Handsome Family, as well as veterans such as June Tabor. James O'Grady (Uilleann pipes, fiddle, flute, vocals) regularly appeared on the Oysters' albums and tours in the last few years.\nJohn Jones, James O'Grady and Ian Telfer provided vocals and instrumentation on Chumbawamba's album A Singsong and a Scrap, and Oysterband provided vocals for the song \"Hull or Hell\" on The Boy Bands Have Won.\nIn 2007, long-standing drummer Lee Partis took a break to concentrate on his work as a psychotherapist, counselling in prisons. In August 2008, he confirmed he would be leaving the band permanently. The band then appointed Dilwyn Davies as replacement drummer.\nFollowing a 30th anniversary concert in December 2008 the band took a six-month sabbatical, during which John Jones and Chopper both made solo albums.\nThe band returned to the studio in 2011, teaming up once again with June Tabor and releasing Ragged Kingdom in September at a sell-out concert at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall. For at least some dates on the Ragged Kingdom tour, they were also joined on bass and guitar by Al Scott, who produced the album. On 8 February 2012, June Tabor and Oysterband won Best Traditional Song, Best Album and Best Group at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards for Ragged Kingdom, with Tabor also winning Folk Singer of the Year.\nRay Cooper announced in December 2012 that he would leave the band at the end of the Ragged Kingdom tour in February 2013, to pursue a solo career. Adrian Oxaal, formerly of rock band James, replaced him on a few gigs late in 2012, and took over in 2013, although it was unclear whether he would become a full-time member of Oysterband. The band also featured Al Scott on bass at some gigs.  Pete Flood, formerly of Bellowhead replaced Davies on drums.\nOn 5 February 2024, John Jones, Alan Prosser and Ian Telfer announced on Facebook that Oysterband will be retiring as a touring band, although they plan a 'long goodbye.'\n\n\n=== Current line-up ===\nJohn Jones – melodeon, lead vocals\nAlan Prosser – guitars, vocals\nIan Telfer – violin, keyboard, vocals\nSean Randle – drums, percussion, vocals\nAl Scott  – bass guitar, mandolin, vocals\nAdrian Oxaal – cello, electric guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nAs Oyster Ceilidh Band\n\nJack's Alive – 1980\nAs Oyster Band\n\nEnglish Rock 'n' Roll: The Early Years 1800–1850 – 1982\nLie Back and Think of England (Pukka Records YOP 04, 1983)\n20 Golden Tie-Slackeners – 1984\nLiberty Hall (Pukka Records YOP 07, 1985)\nStep Outside – 1986\nWide Blue Yonder – 1987\nRide (Cooking Vinyl COOK 020, 1989)\nLove Vigilantes – 1989 (10 inch EP on pink vinyl, cover is a 6-fold poster)\nLittle Rock to Leipzig - 1990\nFreedom and Rain – 1990 (collaboration with June Tabor)\nAs Oysterband\n\nDeserters – 1992\nHoly Bandits – 1993\nTrawler – 1994\nThe Shouting End of Life – 1995\nDeep Dark Ocean – 1997\nHere I Stand – 1999\nRise Above – 2002\n25 – 2003\nMeet You There – 2007\nThe Oxford Girl and Other Stories – 2008\nRagged Kingdom (Topic Records, 2011; vinyl issue on Stamford Audio STAMP 1008) (collaboration with June Tabor, credited to June Tabor & Oysterband)\nDiamonds on the Water – 2014\nRead the Sky - 2022\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nLittle Rock to Leipzig – 1990 (partially live)\nAlive and Shouting – 1996\nAlive and Acoustic – 1998\n25th Anniversary Concert – DVD – 2004\nNorthern Light – 2006\nFire and Fleet – 2019 (collaboration with June Tabor, partially live)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nThe Rough Guide to World Music – 1994 (contributing the track \"When I'm Up I Can't Get Down\")\nThe Rough Guide to English Roots Music – 1998 (contributing the track \"Sail on By\")\nPearls from the Oysters – 1998 (taking tracks from Step Outside, Wide Blue Yonder, Ride and Little Rock to Leipzig)\nGranite Years (The Best of Oysterband 1986–1997) – 2000, double album\nThis House Will Stand (The Best Of Oysterband 1998–2015) – 2016, double album with \"The Work Of My Own Two Hands\" plus alternate versions and demos\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOysterband discography at Discogs"

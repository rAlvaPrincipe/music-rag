    "text": "TV Moroni  (Serbian Cyrillic: ТВ Морони; trans. TV Morons) was a Serbian new wave/punk rock band from Belgrade, notable as the participant of the Artistička radna akcija project in 1981.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band consisted of Zoran Cerar (vocals), Aleksandar Aleksandrić (lead guitar), Aleksandar Đukić (rhythm guitar), Zoran Janković (bass) and Mićo Uzelac (drums). Other band members were Srđan Dragojević, and Goran Nikolić, but they did not record anything with the band.\nTV Moroni's two songs, \"Moja borba\" (\"My Struggle\") and \"Pada noć\" (\"The Night Is Falling\"), were the closing tracks of the \"Artistička radna akcija\" (Artistic Work Action) various artist compilation, featuring the second generation of the Belgrade new wave and punk rock bands. The band also appeared on the first Ventilator Demo Top 10 show in February 1983 with the song \"Tebi dajem sve\" (\"I Give Everything to You\"), but it was never released. After the compilation release, the band disbanded.\nAfter the band's disbandment, Aleksadar Đukić formed the band Nesalomivi in September 1986, and despite having their single \"Ja imam ideju\" (\"I Have an Idea\"), a song from the TV Moroni period written by Zoran Cerar and Aleksadar Đukić, released on the ZKP RTLJ compilation 101 otkucaj u ritmu srca vol. 1 and a significant airplay on the Yugoslav radio stations, record labels did not show much interest for the band and in 1989 they disbanded. In 2008, the band reunited and recorded the album Isti onaj dečak (That Same Boy), released by Dallas Records in 2010.\nSrđan Dragojević became a famous movie director and screenplay writer.

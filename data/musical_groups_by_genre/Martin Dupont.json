    "text": "Martin Dupont is a French electro, new wave and cold wave band formed in Marseille in 1980. Best known for their synth-pop melodies, the original line-up consisted of Alain Seghir (vocals, bass, synthesizer, guitar), Brigitte Balian (vocals, synthesizer, guitar, bass) and Catherine Loy (vocals). Although Seghir remained the main songwriter, the line-up changed with additions, including the classically trained musician Beverly Jane Crew (clarinet, saxophone, synthesizer).\nThe band released three critically acclaimed albums: \"Just Because (Facteurs dâ€™Ambiance)\" (1984), \"Sleep Is A Luxury\" (1985) and \"Hot Paradox\" (1987). They broke up in 1988 but steadily developed a cult following over the following decades, and have been sampled by Kanye West, Tricky and Madlib. They reformed in 2022 and toured the following year. The song \"Inside Out\" from \"Hot Paradox\" (1987) was featured in the film Cuckoo (2024).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nJust Because (1984)\nSleep Is A Luxury (1985)\nHot Paradox (1987)\nKintsugi (2023)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Your Passion\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo for \"Love On My Side\", Minimal Wave Records\nMartin Dupon, Bandcamp page"

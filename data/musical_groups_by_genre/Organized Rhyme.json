    "text": "Organized Rhyme was a Canadian hip hop group based in Ottawa, Ontario.\nThe group became one of the first Canadian rap acts to sign a record deal with a major label (A&M Records) and the video for their debut single \"Check the O.R.\" won the MuchMusic Video Award for Best Rap Video in 1992. Comedian Tom Green was one of the group's founding members.\n\n\n== History ==\nOrganized Rhyme was formed in 1990 by Tom Green (a.k.a. MC Bones), Greg Campbell (a.k.a. MC Pin or Pin The Chameleon) and Geordie Ferguson (a.k.a. DJ Signal). The group signed with A&M Records in 1991.  The group released their debut album Huh!? Stiffenin Against the Wall in 1992.  That same year the video for their first single \"Check the O.R.\", won the MuchMusic Video Award for Best Rap Video. In 1993 \"Check the O.R.\" was also nominated for a Juno Award in the category of Best Rap Recording, but the song lost to \"Keep It Slammin'\" by Devon.\nThe group toured with such artists as The Barenaked Ladies, Dream Warriors and Maestro Fresh Wes. They disbanded shortly after the release of their first album.\nGreen's 2005 rap album Prepare for Impact included a bonus DVD that contained both a live solo-performance of \"Check the O.R.\" as well as a recording of the original music video.\nOrganized Rhyme reunited and recorded a new video for \"Check the O.R.\" for the 2011 Just for Laughs festival in Montreal, Quebec.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Huh!?

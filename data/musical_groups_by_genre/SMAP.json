    "text": "SMAP (Japanese: スマップ, Hepburn: Sumappu) was a Japanese boy band, composed of Masahiro Nakai, Takuya Kimura, Goro Inagaki, Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, and Shingo Katori. The group was created in 1988 by music producer Johnny Kitagawa, founder of Johnny & Associates, originally as a six-piece with Katsuyuki Mori, until his departure from the band in 1996. The name stands for \"Sports Music Assemble People\". After making their debut in 1991, the group took the Japanese entertainment industry by storm, becoming one of the most successful boy bands in Asia. The group is often referred to as a \"national treasure\" and a \"fortune and property of the country\" in Japan.\nSMAP was regarded as an iconic group in Japan, after achieving an unprecedented level of success in numerous genres in the entertainment industry, including music, television, film, radio, and theater, as a group and individually. SMAP was credited for changing the Japanese entertainment and music industry, in terms of prolonging longevity of boy bands and broadening careers by creating new opportunities for bands that followed. After starting out as a typical boy band, with a fan base predominantly female teens, they gradually transformed into a band with a wider audience, expanding their fan base to preteens, male adults, and even the elderly, after their success as actors and television personalities.\nSMAP released 55 singles, all of which reached the top 10 in the charts, 22 consecutive number-one singles, and 33 number-one singles in total. The band has had 24 top-10 albums and 14 number-one albums. \"The One and Only Flower in the World\", released in 2003, is the best selling single in the 21st century and the third best selling single in Japanese history and has become the most recognized song in Japan, as it appears in text books used in school and children are taught to learn the song at a young age. Other best selling singles by the group include, \"Beyond the Night Sky\", \"Lion Heart\", \"Shake\", \"Aoi Inazuma\", which also have become some of the most popular songs in Japan. Throughout their career, the band has sold over 38.5 million records in Japan alone.\nIn April 1996, the group launched their weekly variety show, SMAP×SMAP, which quickly gained high ratings and became one of the most famous television shows in Japan. The distinct format of the program has received widespread critical praise. The show ranked No. 1 in the annual household share ratings in 1996, 1997, 1999–2002, 2006, and 2016, making it the most watched television show in Japan. The episode aired in January 2002 is currently ranked No. 7 for the most watched Japanese variety show in history, with 34.2 million viewers. It is the eighth longest-running prime-time television program in Japan, as of 2016.\nSMAP officially disbanded on December 31, 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1986–1991: Formation ===\nIn 1986, Masahiro Nakai (age 14), auditioned to enter Johnny & Associates, a Japanese talent agency that recruits and trains young boys, preteens to teens, to become singers and members of boy bands. Later, in 1987, Takuya Kimura (age 15), Goro Inagaki (age 14), Katsuyuki Mori (age 13), Tsuyoshi Kusanagi (age 13), and Shingo Katori (age 10) auditioned individually and joined the agency. In Autumn 1987, twenty boys, from ages ten to seventeen, were put together into a group called The Skate Boys, which was initially created as backup dancers for a famous boy band, Hikaru Genji. In April 1988, producer Johnny Kitagawa chose six out of the twenty boys to create a new boy band and named them \"SMAP\".\nWhile the group continued to work as backup dancers for Hikaru Genji, they spent their early years as actors and television personalities. In 1988, they starred in a weekly variety program, Watto Atsumare, with Masataka Itsumi and Cha Kato and appeared regularly until the program ended several months later. In 1989, they started to host their own music show, Uta no Big Fight and Pop City X, as well as appearing regularly on a variety program, Idol Kyowakoku, from 1989 to 1991. In 1988, SMAP made their acting debut in a drama television series, Abunai Shonen III, playing themselves as the main role. Their first self-titled variety program, SMAP no Gakuen Kids, aired from 1990 to 1991.\n\n\n=== 1991–1993: Debut and early years ===\nOn January 1, 1991, the band held their first concert in Nippon Budokan and their first tour from March through April, before releasing any music. On September 9, 1991, they released their first single, \"Can't Stop -Loving-\" from Victor Entertainment, which peaked at No. 2 on the charts. Subsequent singles, \"Seigi no Mikata wa Ate ni Naranai\", \"Kokoro no Kagami\", \"Makeru na Baby\" peaked in the top 10. The band asked the fans to write the lyrics for \"Kokoro no Kagami\", and the one submitted by a fourteen-year-old girl was chosen. The song was later used in a Panasonic television commercial. They were invited to perform the song at Kohaku Uta Gassen, an annual music show, on December 31, 1991.\nAt the same time of their debut, the Japanese music industry experienced what is frequently referred to as an \"Idol Ice Age\", where many of the popular music shows that aired weekly since the 1980s ended, and singers and bands lost a place to perform, resulting in scarce opportunities for TV exposure. Therefore, the agency decided to market the band through variety programs, where members participated in sketch comedies and game shows along with other television personalities. This non-mainstream marketing approach turned out to be a success, as the members' humorous and playful spirits on these shows propelled them to gain new fans, despite not having many musical performances on television since their debut.\nIn 1991, the band's first self-titled television show, SMAP no Gakuen Kids, got renewed and changed to, I Love SMAP, which aired until 1996. From October 7, 1991, Inagaki launched his radio program, Stop The SMAP, still airing as of 2016. From April 1992 to September 1995, the group appeared regularly on a weekly variety program, Yume ga Mori Mori. Due to the fact that this was the first time in Japanese history, that a band participated in a sketch comedy, this rare act attracted wide attention.\nOn January 1, 1992, they released their first album, SMAP 001, which peaked at No. 14 and released another album, SMAP 002, in the same year and peaked at No. 6. Their singles, \"Egao no Genki\", \"Yuki ga Futtekita\", \"Zutto Wasurenai\", \"Hajimete no Natsu\", \"Kimi wa Kimi dayo\", \"$10\", and \"Kimi iro Omoi\", released from 1992 through 1994, all peaked at the top 10. They headlined three tours in 1992, from January to August. In 1993, they released their third and fourth album, SMAP 003 and SMAP 004, which peaked at No. 11 and No. 3 respectively. In 1992, Inagaki starred in a drama television series, Hatachi no Yakusoku, as the main role. In 1993, Kimura starred in a drama television series, Asunaro Hakusho, which became a massive hit, with an average household share rating of 27% and 31.9% for the season finale. Kimura's popularity soared and from then on, members of the band started their acting careers individually.\n\n\n=== 1994–1995: Breakthrough, \"Gambarimashou\", and SMAP 007 Gold Singer ===\nIn 1994, they released two albums, SMAP 005 and SMAP 006 Sexy Six, which both peaked at No. 2. On March 12, 1994, they released their 12th single, \"Hey Hey Ookini Maidoari\", which gave the band their first number one hit. Subsequent singles, \"Original Smile\", peaked at No. 2 and \"Gambarimashou\", and \"Tabun Alright\", reached number one. The two number-one singles became the band's ninth and tenth best selling single. \"Gambarimashou\" saw a jump in sales from the previous singles, becoming one of the most popular songs in Japan and helped the band gain a broader fan base. From 2002, \"Original Smile\" appeared on text books used in music classes in high school. From April 1994, Nakai and Katori started starring on the most famous Japanese daytime live television program, Waratte Iitomo. In October 1995, Kusanagi joined in and the three members appeared regularly for 20 years, Katori on Mondays, Nakai on Tuesdays, and Kusanagi on Fridays, until the program ended in 2014. From July to August, the band held their first large-scale tour, Sexy Six Show, hitting the three major cities in Japan. The tour was released on VHS on November 11, 1994, and later on DVD on December 24, 2003. On March 12, 1994, SMAP starred in their first film, Shoot!. The film aired on television for the first time on January 4, 2010, sixteen years after its release.\nOn January 1, 1995, the band released their first compilation album, Cool, which reached number one. The band gave an opportunity for fans to create the track list and the top fourteen of their favorite songs made it into the album. Singles released in 1995, \"Kansha shite\", \"Shiyouyo\", \"Donna Iikoto\", and \"Oretachini Asu wa Aru\", all reached number one on the charts, giving the band six consecutive number-one singles since \"Gambarimasho\" released in the previous year. \"Oretachini Asu wa Aru\" became the band's sixth best selling single. From January 1995, Kimura launched his weekly radio program, What's Up SMAP, still airing as of 2016. In January 1995, Nakai landed his first drama television series, Ajiichi Monme, which became an instant hit. Two seasons and four special episodes were made through 1995 to 2013. While he started to pursue his acting career, he also started to work individually as a television personality and as a news presenter, carrying many of his own television programs, which lead to expanding the capacity of a boy band.\nFrom April 1995, the group launched a variety show, SMAP no Gambarimashou, derived from the single released the previous year, which aired on weeknights. The content of the show changed daily. On Mondays they performed a theatrical act, Tuesdays were talk show-based with a musical segment, on Wednesdays they aired a short TV movie that they starred in, Thursdays were talk show-based with a guest celebrity, and on Fridays they performed sketch comedy. It is said that this program became a basic framework for SMAP×SMAP which started a year after the program began. From April 1995, Kusanagi and Katori launched their radio program, SMAP Power Splash.\nFrom July 1, 1995, Nakai launched his weekly radio program, Some Girl SMAP still airing as of 2016. On July 7, 1995, they released their seventh album, SMAP 007 Gold Singer, which became their first number-one studio album and was certified double platinum. They launched a tour, Summer Minna Atumare Party. After this tour, the band started to be called one of the hardest bands to get concert tickets for. In August 1995, they hosted the annual telethon, 24 Hour Television, and raised 1.2 billion yen. The band started performing at an annual music show, FNS Kayosai, and has become one of the main performers of the show since. From 2005, Kusanagi became the host of the show until he passed on the position to a comedian in 2014. In December 1995, they hosted a TV special, Sanma&SMAP, with comedian Sanma Akashiya and the program has become an annual event since for NTV, with 21 episodes aired.\n\n\n=== 1996–1997: SMAP×SMAP, Lonvaca phenomenon, Mori's departure, and \"Shake\" ===\n\nOn March 3, 1996, they released their eighth album, SMAP 008 Tacomax, which peaked at No. 2, with over 500,000 copies sold. Singles \"Munasawagi wo Tanomuyo\" and \"Hadaka no Osama\" both peaked at No. 2 on the charts and was certified double Platinum. \"Hadaka no Osama\" became Mori's last single before his departure from the group. The band released another album, SMAP 009, on August 12, which reached number one. From March to April, they held their last tour as a six-piece.\nOn April 15, 1996, SMAP launched their self-titled variety show, SMAP×SMAP, commonly known as \"SmaSma\" (suma-suma), which was their first program on a prime-time slot. Along with the band's ability to entertain and their humorous personalities, the distinct format of the program received widespread critical praise. The show quickly gained high ratings, as it topped the rankings of annual household share ratings, dominating other existing popular programs. Consisting with an interview/cooking-based segment \"Bistro SMAP\", sketch comedy series, games, and musical performances by the group and with other musical guests, the program has had countless guests from around the world and is known for being the show with the widest range of guests in Japanese television history. The show ranked No. 1 in the annual household share ratings in 1996, 1997, 1999 – 2002, 2006, and 2016 making it the most watched television show in Japan. The episode aired in January 2002 is currently ranked No. 7 for the most watched Japanese variety show in history, with 34.2 million viewers. It is the eighth longest-running prime-time television program in Japan and Fuji Television's second longest-running prime-time television program, as of 2016.\nFrom April to June 1996, Nakai, Kimura, and Katori each landed a role on a drama television series. Nakai played the main role in Shori no Megami, Kimura in Long Vacation, and Katori in Tomei Ningen. All three series were successful and gained high ratings. Among the three, Kimura's Long Vacation, which aired Monday nights, became a major success and a social phenomenon. Magazines and other media stated that, \"women disappear from the city on Mondays\", pointing out the large viewership and how intoxicating the show was for women in Japan. After Kimura playing a young pianist, there was a rapid increase of young men who started taking piano lessons. The cultural impact and influences of the show is commonly referred to as the \"Lonvaca (ron-bake) phenomenon\". This was also a breakthrough for Kimura as an actor and helped him gain recognition and a more broad fan base.\nIn May 1996, Mori's departure from the band was announced. Mori had always wanted to pursue Auto Race, a Japanese version of motorcycle speedway, since he was a child. Due to the fact that there was an age limit of twenty-three for students who wanted to attend school for Auto Race, Mori left the band aged 22. On May 27, a special episode on SMAP×SMAP, dedicated to Mori, was created and aired SMAP's last performance as a six-piece. Nakai said that he had an emotional breakdown after Mori's leave, not wanting to continue as a five-piece, fearing that their popularity will plummet and that he wished for a breakup.\nOn July 13 and 14, 1996, they hosted the annual twenty-seven-hour long television special, FNS 27 Hour Television. On July 15, 1996, the band released their single, \"Aoi Inazuma\", the first material released after Mori's departure, which reached number one on the charts. Their subsequent single, \"Shake\" was released in November, also reaching number one. These two songs were both certified triple platinum and became the band's fifth and fourth best selling single, respectively. \"Shake\" has surpassed one million copies in terms of shipments. From July to August, they held their second stadium tour, Chomugendaisho, which was the first tour after Mori's departure.\nOn January 3, 1997, SMAP starred in a TV movie, Boku ga Boku de Aru Tame ni. In February 1997, they released their single, \"Dynamite\", which peaked at No. 3 in the charts and became the band's eighth best selling single. In May 1997, they released their twenty-fifth single, \"Celery\", which was a cover of a song first released by singer-songwriter Masayoshi Yamazaki in 1996. Although Yamazaki's original version did not turn out to be a success, the cover version by SMAP peaked at No. 2 and was certified double Platinum. The band became a catalyst for the recognition of the song, turning it into one of the most popular songs in Japan. On March 26, 1997, the band released its second compilation album, Wool, which peaked at No. 2.\nFrom April to June 1997, Kusanagi landed a role in a drama television series, Ii Hito. The band's single \"Celery\" became the theme song for the show. Nakai and Kimura made a cameo appearance on the show. Nakai, Kimura, Inagaki, and Katori had played a main role in a television series and with Kusanagi starring in Ii Hito, all five members had become leading man-class actors.\nFrom July to September 1997, the band headlined their third stadium tour, SMAP 1997 Su, which was released through VHS and DVD on December 17, 1997. On August 6, 1997, the band released their tenth album, SMAP 011 Su, which peaked at No. 3 in the charts and was certified Platinum. From this point on, SMAP changed the pace of their releases from two albums per year to one, due to their busy schedules after experiencing individual success, as actors and television personalities. In September 1997, they released a new single, \"Peace\", which peaked at No. 2. On December 31, 1997, they performed at the annual music show, Kohaku Uta Gassen, for the seventh consecutive year. While they appeared as the performer for the previous six years, Nakai became the host of the show, which is the most prestigious job for television personalities. Nakai also hosted the program in 1998 and established himself as a highly regarded host on television.\n\n\n=== 1998–2000: \"Beyond the Night Sky\", \"Lion Heart\", and Shingo Mama phenomenon ===\nOn January 14, 1998, the band's twenty-seventh single, \"Beyond the Night Sky\", was released. It reached number one on the charts and became the best selling single of that month and the second best selling single of that year. The song became the band's second best selling single, with over 1,620,000 physical copies sold. From April 2002, it has appeared in text books used in music classes in middle school and has become one of the most recognized songs in Japan. Many artists have released a cover since its release. Its subsequent single, \"Taisetsu\", which was used as the theme song for Nakai's drama television series, Brothers, peaked at No. 4 and was certified platinum. On June 18, 1998, the band released their eleventh album, SMAP 012 Viva Amigos, which reached number one in the charts and became their tenth best selling album. The band headlined their fourth stadium tour, Viva Amigos. The tour was released through VHS on December 24, 1998, and later through DVD on December 6, 2000.\nFrom October 1998, Nakai and Katori launched their own variety program, SataSma, which was created and aimed towards younger viewers and families. Katori starred in a segment titled, \"Shingo Mama's Secret Breakfast\", where Katori would cross-dress into a character called, \"Shingo Mama\", and visit houses to cook breakfast for children instead of their mother, allowing her to sleep in and rest in the morning. Katori started to use the phrase, \"Ohha\", a pun for \"Ohayo\", meaning \"good morning\" during the segment as his trademark phrase, which soon became a popular word used among children. Shingo Mama, the lovable character Katori played, and the phrase \"Ohha\", became a social phenomenon. As a result, SMAP incidentally brought in kindergartners and preteens to their fan base.\nIn January 1999, the band released \"Asahi wo Mini Ikouyo\", which peaked at number 3 and its subsequent single, \"Fly\", peaked at number 2 in the charts. On January 3, 1999, SMAP starred in a special episode on the popular Japanese detective-drama television series Furuhata Ninzaburo, as themselves. The episode became the most watched program among all television series broadcast in 1999, with 32.3 million viewers, and the second most watched television program after an episode of SMAP×SMAP. On July 14, 1999, they released their twelfth album, Birdman SMAP 013, which peaked at No. 2. From July to September, they headlined their fifth stadium tour, SMAP 1999 Tour Birdman. The tour was released through VHS on December 22, 1999, and through DVD on January 1, 2000.\nIn August 2000, the band released their thirty-second single, \"Lion Heart\", which became a massive success with over 1,560,000 copies sold, reaching number one on the charts for two consecutive weeks. The song was used as the theme song for Kusanagi's drama television series, Food Fight, and became the band's third best selling single. It quickly became one of the most recognized songs in Japan. In August 2000, Katori also released a single, \"Shingo Mama's Oha Rock\", as Shingo Mama, which reached number one on the charts with over 1,300,000 physical copies sold and became a social phenomenon. James Brown guest-starred in the music video, along with other Japanese celebrities who made cameo appearances. In December 2000, the term \"Ohha\", used by Katori, won the Ryukougo Taisho, an annual traditional event of announcing words that describes that year.\nOn October 14, 2000, the band released their thirteenth album, S map SMAP 014. From this point on, SMAP changed the pace of their releases from one album per year to one album every two years, due to their busy individual schedules, as actors and television personalities. They headlined their sixth stadium tour, S map Tour, from October to November. The tour was released through DVD on March 14, 2001. The number of shows performed changed to one per day from this tour on. Kimura announced his marriage to singer Shizuka Kudo and her pregnancy during the tour. He had a press conference after the show at Saitama Super Arena.\n\n\n=== 2001–2003: SMAP Vest, pamS, Drink SMAP, \"The One and Only Flower in the World\", and MIJ ===\nOn March 23, 2001, the band released their third compilation album, Smap Vest, which reached number one in the charts. It sold one million copies during the first week of release and 1,800,000 copies in total, becoming the band's best selling album. Singles, \"Smac\" and \"freebird\", peaked at No. 3 and No. 1 on the charts respectively. \"Smac\" was released as the 10th anniversary single and lyrics from the band's past singles were put together and made into a new song. On August 8, 2001, another compilation album, pamS (read as \"Ura-suma\"), was released just four months after Smap Vest. It was a compilation of fan-favorites and songs that the members personally like, that aren't usually sang on tour or on television, such as B-sides and songs from past albums. From July to September, the band launched their seventh stadium tour, pamS Tour, which was also their first five-dome tour and the first five-dome tour ever headlined in history. SMAP invented the concept of a \"five-dome tour\", a tour that hits the five dome-shaped stadiums located in Japan (Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka, and Sapporo). Since the invention of this new touring style, the five-dome tour is now used by many artists in Japan, as a symbol of being a first-rank artist in the music industry. The pamS Tour was released through DVD on December 21, 2001.\nThroughout the year 2001, all five members starred in their own drama television series individually. Nakai starred in Shiroi Kage, Kimura in a detective series, Hero, Inagaki in Onmyoji, and Kusanagi in Star no Koi. Katori starred in a special episode of a comedy-drama television series, Ohha wa Sekai wo Sukuu. All programs were that year's high-rated programs. Among all shows, Hero became a massive success, becoming the most highest rated television series in Japanese history, becoming the only television series to have all episodes marking above the 30% sharehold rate.\nOn July 24, 2002, they released their fourteenth album, SMAP 015/Drink! Smap!, which peaked at No. 2 in the charts and became the band's fourth best selling album. The title was derived from a superseded soft drink, called SMAP, which was sold in Japan in the 1980s. From July 23, 2002, a canned soft drink, Drink SMAP, was launched from Kirin Beverage Corporation. Six million drinks were shipped on the day of its release. From July to November, they launched their eighth stadium tour, SMAP 02 Drink Smap Tour, which became the largest tour in terms of attendance in Japanese history, with a total attendance of 1.2 million. They decided mainly to use soccer stadiums for their venues, as it was the year the 2002 FIFA World Cup was held. The tour was released through DVD on March 5, 2003. On September 21, 2002, they released their first video album, Clip! Smap!, a collection of ten music videos released since 1996.\nOn March 5, 2003, the band's thirty-fifth single, \"The One and Only Flower in the World\", was released. It reached number one in the charts for three consecutive weeks twice and for seven non-consecutive weeks. It became the best selling single in the 21st century and the fifth best selling single in Japanese history. The song appears in text books used in school as children are taught to learn the song at a young age and has become one of the most recognized songs in Japan. It is the band's best selling single, with over 2,700,000 physical copies sold and their first record to sell over two million copies. In 2012, JASRAC, announced the winner of the JASRAC Award, in celebration of the award created in 1982. \"The One and Only Flower in the World\" received the award, as the copyrighted work in music with the highest paid royalties within the past thirty years. After thirteen years from its release, the single has continued to chart in the Top 200, for a total of two-hundred non-consecutive weeks and is currently ranked second with the highest total weeks in the charts, after \"Nada Soso\" (232 non-consecutive weeks). The song has been covered and re-arranged by heavy metal guitarist Marty Friedman on his 2006 album Loudspeaker.\nOn June 25, 2003, they released their fifteenth album, SMAP 016/MIJ, which peaked at number one and became the band's eighth best selling album. From July to September 2003, the band launched their ninth stadium tour, MIJ Tour. SMAP became the third artist in history to hold a concert at the International Stadium Yokohama, after B'z and Eikichi Yazawa. Due to scheduling conflicts with Katori's NHK Taiga drama, Shinsengumi, the number of shows were reduced compared to previous years, though the number of attendees surpassed one million two years in a row. The tour was released through DVD on December 24, 2003.\nOn December 31, 2003, SMAP appeared on the annual music show on NHK, Kohaku Uta Gassen, and performed \"The One and Only Flower in the World\". Out of the fifty-eight artists on the program, SMAP performed last for the first time, serving as the ootori, the most honorable and prestigious title in the Japanese music industry. SMAP became the first pop artist and the first group in history to perform as the ootori since the program started in 1951, as Kohaku is a historical and traditional music program and enka artists dominated the position of the ootori. As artists are ranked according to the ratings during their performance, SMAP ranked number one out of fifty-eight artists and was the most watched act of that year's Kohaku, with a household share rating of 57.1%.\n\n\n=== 2004–2005: Individual activities and SAMPLE Bang ===\nAlthough all five members were able to work actively as a group while pursuing solo careers since their debut, in 2004, their solo projects were on a tight schedule compared to the previous years, as they all carried their own television programs and worked as actors, on both television and film. They were not able to rearrange their schedules to fit in a time to work as a group, besides the taping of their weekly television program, SMAP×SMAP. It was announced that the band did not have a single day that all five members could meet together, other than the taping of SMAP×SMAP, which happened four times a month, commenting on the impossibility of shooting a music video, promoting a record, or going on tour. This led to a musical hiatus in a way, although they continued to perform their songs every week in a musical segment on SMAP×SMAP. This was the first time in thirteen years that the band did not release any new material or go on tour. A song titled \"Wonderful Life\" was initially scheduled to become the band's new single in 2004. After finding out that the release was unlikely, they first decided to wait until the coming year but later had Inagaki release the song as a solo artist instead. He created a temporary stage name, &G, and made his solo debut in March and the single reached number one in the charts.\nFrom August 2004, Nakai launched his career as a sportscaster and became the host of the Olympic games on TBS. \"Susume Gold\", a remix of their song form their fifteenth album, SMAP 016/MIJ, was scheduled to be released on September 8, 2004, as the band's thirty-sixth single but was later canceled. The song served as the official song of the 2004 Summer Olympics and used during its television coverage on TBS. In December 2004, SMAP aired a television special as an apology for their musical hiatus and to show the fans their appreciation for their support on the group's solo projects. By the end of 2004, their single, \"The One and Only Flower in the World\", released in 2003, had become the best selling single in the 21st century and the most recognized song in Japan. Although many assumed that the band would be performing the song again at Kohaku Uta Gassen as the ootori, as they did the previous year, the band declined their invitation from the show due to not releasing any new music in 2004. Kohaku experienced a fall in ratings that year and became the lowest-rated Kohaku in history and the absence of SMAP is thought to be the cause of this.\nIn January 2005, the band released their new single, \"Tomodachi e Say What You Will\", a cover of Eric Clapton's \"Say What You Will\", which reached number one in the charts. Its subsequent singles, \"Bang Bang Vacation\" and \"Triangle\", and their sixteenth album, Sample Bang!, released on July 27, 2005, all reached number one in the charts as well. \"Triangle\" served as the official song of all sports broadcasts on TV Asahi, such as the 2006 Winter Olympics, the 2006 World Baseball Classic, and the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating. It was featured during the television coverage on TV Asahi from November 2005 through March 2006. Later in 2008, it was announced that \"Triangle\" would be appearing on text books used in music classes in school.

On August 17, 2011, the band released their fifth compilation album, SMAP Aid, to support the people affect by the earthquake and tsunami. Two-hundred yen per album sold were donated to the victims.

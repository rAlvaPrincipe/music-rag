Much of their reputation has been built on the strength and spontaneity of their live show.\nThe band won Worcester's Got Talent in October 2009 winning first prize of Â£2,500, and recorded a 4 track EP of original material apart from a version of \"You Got the Love\"; Naked Remedy have also performed for many local charities including Wyrefest 2009 for The Proton Effect, Help For Heroes, Loaded 2010, Boozestock 2009 and a Help for Haiti fundraiser. They also appeared live at the world's largest VW Camper Van Event Vanfest in 2010 and again in 2011. In 2012 they appeared on the Jubilee stage at the annual Glastonbudget festival.\nPast individual achievements of band members include sharing the bill with Velvet Revolver, Status Quo, Jeff Healey, Walter Trout, Chicken Shack, Wishbone Ash, Hayseed Dixie and Rose Hill Drive, and bookings at The Royal Albert Hall and Download Festival 2008. They have recently supported Goldray, a group featuring Kenwyn House (Reef) and Paul Winterhart (Kula Shaker).\n\n\n== BBC Sessions ==\nNaked Remedy have appeared on BBC Introducing with Andrew Marston They also headlined The Hereford & Worcester Introducing Stage to launch the start of the Worcester Music Festival in August 2010\n\n\n== Studio recording ==\nIn between the visceral dissonance of live performance, the band found time to record their debut self-titled, which sold out within three months.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nArley Fest\nWorcester Music Festival\nBridge Bash\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMusicbrainz Artist Entry\nBBC Artist page"

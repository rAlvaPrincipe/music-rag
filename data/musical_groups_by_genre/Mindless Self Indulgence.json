    "text": "Mindless Self Indulgence (often referred to as MSI) is an American electropunk band formed in New York City in 1997. Their music has a mixed style which includes punk rock, alternative rock, electronica, techno, industrial, hip hop, and breakbeat hardcore.\n\n\n== History ==\nBetween 1987 and 1996, Jimmy Urine recorded about 35 songs which varied in musical style, usually settling in an industrial/electronic punk style. These songs were recorded with himself and his brother, Markus Euringer in New York City using rudimentary equipment. Urine and his brother released an album titled Mindless Self-Indulgence, featuring Steve, Righ? on 'Bed of Roses', which featured songs performed in an industrial style akin to Nine Inch Nails.\nIn 1997, Urine recorded a cover of Method Man's \"Bring the Pain\" that was made by merging six different styles of the same cover into one song. This became the basis for the Mindless Self Indulgence sound. The band formed soon after when Urine was joined by Steve, Righ? on guitar, Urine's brother Markus Euringer on second guitar (replaced by bassist Vanessa Y.T., who was subsequently replaced by bassist Lyn-Z), and Kitty on drums. They have released six albums, four EPs, eight remix albums, one live album, one compilation album, and one live DVD. Rather than signing traditional record contracts, the band has licensed most of their albums to record labels, retaining ownership of the music.\nIn summer of 2007, the band toured as part of the Revolution Stage of Projekt Revolution, a music festival hosted by Linkin Park. In January 2009, the band headlined the Kerrang! Relentless Energy Drink tour.\nIn December 2010, they released a comic titled Adventures Into Mindless Self Indulgence about various tour stories and significant moments of the band's career. The band released a remastered CD/DVD version of their first full-length album, Tight, in 2011, titled Tighter. It included bonus tracks and recordings from their early days. On October 25, 2012, the band announced their fifth album via a Kickstarter campaign. How I Learned to Stop Giving a Shit and Love Mindless Self Indulgence was released in May 2013, following with the release of singles \"It Gets Worse\" in December and \"Fuck Machine\" in January 2014. Later in January 2014, the band announced that they would be taking a hiatus.\nOn September 18, 2015, Mindless Self Indulgence released Pink, a collection of 19 songs recorded between 1990 and 1997 by Urine. The album includes cut-down and remastered versions of songs from the self-titled album, an audio diary recorded by Urine from July 1992, and covers of Depeche Mode's \"Personal Jesus\" and Duran Duran's \"Girls on Film\".\nOn August 9, 2021, a lawsuit was filed against James Euringer (Jimmy Urine) in New York Supreme Court with the charge of sexual battery of a minor, who claims that she had a sexual relationship with Euringer for over two years — from January 1997 to June 1999 — starting when she was 15 years old and Euringer was 27. On March 26, 2024, all charges against Euringer were dismissed with prejudice after all parties involved in the suit agreed to a stipulation of dismissal.\nOn June 20, 2024, the band released MSI B-SIDES vol. 1 without any prior notice. The album contained songs that had not been previously available on streaming platforms.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nJimmy Urine – lead vocals, synthesizer, programming (1997–present)\nSteve, Righ? – guitars, backing vocals (1997–present)\nKitty – drums (1997–present)\nLyn-Z – bass (2001–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nMarkus Euringer – keyboard, turntables (1997–1998)\nVanessa Y.T. – bass (1998–2001)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\n\n=== Demo albums ===\nCrappy Little Demo (1997)\nThank God Demo (2001)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== The Left Rights ===\nSide project by Jimmy Urine and Steve, Righ?\nThe Left Rights\n\nReleased: September 24, 2002\nLabel: Uppity Cracker\nBad Choices Made Easy\n\nReleased: November 9, 2010\nLabel: Metropolis\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n=== Video albums ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nMindless Self Indulgence at AllMusic\nMindless Self Indulgence discography at Discogs \nMindless Self Indulgence discography at MusicBrainz"

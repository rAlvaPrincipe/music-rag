    "text": "Nobodyknows (stylized as nobodyknows+) is a Japanese hip-hop band founded in 1999.\n\n\n== History ==\nNobodyknows debuted in 2003 on the Sony Music Associated Records label with the mini-album Nobody knows 3.  They quickly came to fame with their single CD \"Kokoro Odoru\", a song that was used as the second ending theme for the anime television series SD Gundam Force and included in the Nintendo DS game Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan. They released their first album, Do You Know?, in June 2004 and debuted at number one on the Japanese Oricon charts. In 2005, the group organized the Nagoya Music Expo in order to help aspiring artists, which ended up drawing in around 10,000 attendees.\nLater that same year, Nobodyknows released their second album, titled 5MC&1DJ. The album featured the song \"Shiawase Nara Te o Tatakō\" which was used as the theme song for the Japanese release of Kung Fu Hustle. The group remained in the public eye in 2006 with a national tour in February as they performed in every prefecture in Japan, which had not been previously done before by a hip-hop group. The tour was filmed and released in November as a DVD and Blu-ray release titled Nobodyknows+ Tour 2006 \"5MC&1DJ\" - Kuribou no Menkui Dochu Hizakurige. The group performed their first overseas concert at Tokyo Night 2007 on 24 March in Long Beach, California.\nTheir single \"Hero’s Come Back!!\" was chosen as the first opening theme for the anime television series Naruto: Shippūden. On 10 February 2009, they released a new single called \"Fallin'\" which featured the original singer Shigeru Matsuzaki. In 2009, they left major label Onenation and returned to their original indie label $Tax (pronounced \"Dollar Tax\") Records.\nIn 2011, member Nori da Funky Shibiresath started balancing his work at Nobodyknows with a career in professional wrestling. He wrestled occasionally and as a freelancer, mainly competing in Dramatic Dream Team and Ice Ribbon, though he became a usual member of Pro Wrestling Heat Up in 2017. His tenure there would be successful, winning the Shakunetsuo Battle League 2017 and taking the Heat Up Universal Championship from founder Kazuhiro Tamura. However, after losing the title to Daisuke Kanehira, he retired from professional wrestling in October 2018.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMC Nashi - Born 21 July 1979\nCrystal Boy - Born 4 July 1977\nYasu Ichiban?

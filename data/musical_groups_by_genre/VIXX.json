Micah Levin Isla from The Philippine Star commented, \"You can be someone who'll never be truly on board with this whole K-Pop craze. But there's something about VIXX that's really fascinating and intriguing. Their music and appeal have this lingering effect.\" VIXX has cemented a \"niche in the theatrical side of K-pop\" with performances that follow a storyline that is carefully put together. In a review of one of their concerts, journalist Park Jung Sun commented, \"They presented live performances which broke prejudices people have towards idols. VIXX presented a musical-like stage as coming off from the-usual-concert which displays singing and dancing. VIXX led their fans to UTOPIA that they constructed\".\n\n\n=== Lyrics and musical style ===\nWith many of their releases, VIXX has tackled themes such as hope, dreams, falling madly in love with a girl although it hurts, such in the songs \"On and On\" (Korean: 다칠 준비가 돼 있어), which literally translates into \"I'm Ready to Get Hurt\", \"Voodoo Doll\" and \"Chained Up\"; breaking up with their lovers \"Love Equation\", \"Don't Want to Be An Idol\"'; generally sad or dark love songs, with the themes of obsession and insanity such as the songs \"Hyde\" and \"G.R.8.U\"; and emotional breakdown in \"Error\" and the timelessness of love in \"Eternity\". Most, if not all of their songs, play on the depth of raw human emotion. VIXX plays an active role producing their music, with all members participating in the ideas and concepts. Ravi, Leo, Hyuk and most recently N and Ken play an active role in composition and lyric-writing of their songs.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\nReality TV Shows\n\nVIXX TV  (2012–present; YouTube)\nMyDOL (2012; Mnet)\nVIXX's MTV Diary (2012; SBS MTV)\nPlan V Diary (2013; SBS MTV)\nVIXX File (2013; Mnet Japan)\nVIXX's One Fine Day (2015; MBC Music)\nProject VIXX ~Invaders from Space~ (2016; Fuji TV NEXT)\nProject VIXX 2 ~Invaders from Space Return~ (2016; Fuji TV NEXT)\nASIA LOVED BY VIXX (2017; skyTravel)\nProject VIXX 3 ~Invaders from Space~ (2017; Fuji TV NEXT)\nProject VIXX 4 ~Invaders from Space~ (2017; Fuji TV NEXT)\nToday is the Best (2019; U+ Idol Live)\n\n\n== Concerts and tours ==\n\n\n=== Headlining ===\n\n\n==== Main Tours ====\nVIXX Global Showcase - The Milky Way (2013)\nVIXX Live Fantasia – HEX SIGN (2014)\nVIXX Live Fantasia – UTOPIA (2015)\nVIXX Live Fantasia – ELYSIUM (2016)\nVIXX Live Fantasia – 백일몽 (Daydream) (2017)\nVIXX Live - Lost Fantasia (2018)\nVIXX Live - VTOYSTORY (2019)\nVIXX Live Fantasia - Parallel (2019)\n\n\n==== Japan Tour ====\nVIXX Japan Live Tour - Depend On (2016)\n\n\n==== Co-headlining ====\nJellyfish Live (2012)\nY.Bird from Jellyfish Island Showcase (2013)\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nIn 2012, VIXX became the Goodwill Ambassadors for The Salvation Army as a part of the 2012 Salvation Army Christmas Kettle, with 14 December 2012 as their Kettle Day—a date which was chosen by fans.\nIn November 2013, VIXX along with Boys Republic became ambassadors for \"Eye Camp Expedition,\" a charity campaign, joining other volunteers in Vietnam to help those visually impaired.

However, the trio got shelved shortly after an encounter with Shaq Fu at the Jive showcase in 1993, leaving Da End Iz Near unreleased.\nIn 2010, Kenny Dennis' little brother Tanya rediscovered two albums, There's a Situation on the Homefront and Da End Iz Near, while cleaning out his garage.\nThere's a Situation on the Homefront, an album recorded in 1993, was released on Breakfast Records in 2010. It features guest appearances from Son Doobie of Funkdoobiest, among others.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThere's a Situation on the Homefront (2010)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTha Grimm Teachaz on Breakfast Records"

    "text": "The Times are a British indie band, the brainchild of Ed Ball, co-founder member of the Television Personalities, Teenage Filmstars and 'O' Level.\n\n\n== Whaam! Records 1981–1982 ==\nAfter releasing a string of 7-inch singles variously as O'Level (\"We Love Malcolm\", 1978), The Television Personalities (\"Part-Time Punks\", 1978), Teenage Filmstars (\"There's A Cloud Over Liverpool\", 1979, \"I Helped Patrick McGoohan Escape\", 1980), that culminated with the debut Television Personalities album \"And Don't The Kids Just Love It\" (1980) on Rough Trade Records, Edward Ball and Daniel Treacy opted for even more artistic control by setting up their own label, WHAAM! Records.\nAt the same time, recorded as a proposed Teenage Filmstars' debut LP, Ball's 1980 collection of songs was completed as \"Go! With The Times\", from which the first Times single \"Red With Purple Flashes\" (1981) was released on Whaam! This was followed by \"Pop Goes Art!\" (1982), released in individually hand-painted sleeves that executed the band's Pop Art visions.\n\n\n== ArTpOp! Records 1982–1986 ==\nOn leaving the Television Personalities, and consequently Whaam!, Ball immediately launched the ARTPOP! label with the Times' second single \"I Helped Patrick McGoohan Escape!\" (September 1982). This was accompanied by humorous tongue in cheek video based on \"The Prisoner\" T.V. series that starred Patrick McGoohan. Ball's songwriting took a more serious turn with \"This Is London\" (1983). Songs like \"Goodbye Piccadilly\", \"If Only\", and the title track, match the bleakness and despair of Joy Division, the cutting sarcasm of The Jam. After the experimental electronics of \"Hello Europe\" (1984), Ball fulfilled a long-time ambition to stage Joe Orton's screenplay for the Beatles \"Up Against It\" at a West London theatre with Tony Conway from Mood Six. This culminated with the Times' fifth album \"Up Against It\" (1985).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nGo! with the Times (November 1980 but released in 1985) [Reissued 2006 with extra tracks]\nPop Goes Art!

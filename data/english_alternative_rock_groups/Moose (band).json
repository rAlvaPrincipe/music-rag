    "text": "Moose were a British indie rock band who formed in London in 1990.  The original line-up included Russell Yates (guitar, vocals), K.J. \"Moose\" McKillop (guitar), Damien Warburton (drums), and Jeremy Tishler (bass).  After Warburton and Tishler left the band they were replaced with Lincoln Fong (bass), his brother Russell (guitar), and Richard Thomas (drums).  Other members have included Mig Moorland (drums) and Mick Conroy (keyboards).\nMoose released two EPs on Hut Records. Within the next few years the band released two albums on Play It Again Sam.  Despite a strong critical response, Moose’s albums continued to sell few copies.  Following the release of their third album, Live a Little Love a Lot, Moose took an extended break from music only to return five years later with the release of High Ball Me!.  The bulk of High Ball Me! had been recorded in 1996 and 1997, (with one song, \"There's a Place,\" dating from 1993), but sat unreleased as the band members decided whether or not to continue with Moose.  \"This River Will Never Run Dry\" featured on the Britpop collection, The Brit Box.\nMcKillop went on to become a founding member of the supergroup Piroshka, along with his partner Miki Berenyi (formerly of Lush), Justin Welch (Elastica) and Michael Conroy (Modern English).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nJack (Hut, 1991) UK no. 108\nCool Breeze (Hut, 1991) UK no. 82\nReprise (Hut, 1991) UK no. 81\n\"Little Bird (Are You Happy in Your Cage)?\" (Hut, 1992)\nLiquid Make-up (Cool Badge, 1993)\nUptown (Play It Again Sam, 1993)\nBang Bang (Play It Again Sam, 1994)\nBaby It's Over (Saltwater Records, 1999)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n...XYZ (Hut, 1992)\nHoney Bee (Play It Again Sam, 1993)\nLive a Little Love a Lot (Play It Again Sam, 1995)\nHigh Ball Me!

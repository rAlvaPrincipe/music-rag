    "text": "Kids Near Water were an English emo, punk and hardcore band from Exeter, England, (featuring ex-members of Annalise and Clinch) who formed in late 2000. The band was composed of lead vocalist and guitarist Brian Read, guitarist and vocalist Simon Joyce, bassist John Astbury and drummer Nik Finch. Kids Near Water released two studio albums, two studio EPs and appeared on several split EPs and compilations.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band initially formed to play one single show and sneak into Millennium celebrations hosted by Exeter Cavern Club for free. Although they had no name at the time, the group appeared at the event unbilled and ended their set proclaiming \"Thanks a lot Exeter, we've been YOUNG CHURCH!\".  After the show they decided to continue and changed their name to Kids Near Water.\n\n\n=== Extended Player One, Mosh & Go and There Is no I In Team EPs (2000-2001) ===\nSigned to Firefly Recordings their debut EP, Extended Player One being the label's first release. The EP was recorded by former Understand member John Hannon in Essex and was awarded 5 K's in Kerrang! as well as a favourable review in NME. Monk Dave, Editor of the UK punk-zine Fracture described the release as \"quite simply the best demo I have ever heard\". In October 2001, the band's track \"Distance Over Time\" appeared alongside Jimmy Eat World, Stapleton and San Quentin on the Fierce Panda Records release Mosh & Go. The band's third release was recorded by former PJ Harvey producer Head in Glastonbury, Somerset and released by Firefly Recordings in November 2001. The same year, the band toured with the punk band Elliot, opened the Concrete Jungle stage at the Reading Festival in August and ended the year with a home-town Christmas show at the Exeter Cavern Club. The show was dubbed the 'Freakscene KKKKKristmas party' because the line up, which also included Exeter punk bands Tyler and Shoe!  had each scored high marks with their debut releases in Kerrang! magazine that year.\n\n\n=== ¡Hey Zeus! (2003) ===\nThe band's debut album, recorded by John Hannon was released by Firefly Recordings in 2003.\n\n\n=== Cave Bear Is Flying Panda LP and 'Kids Near Water / The Coalfield / America Is Waiting' split EP (2005) ===\nThe band appeared on a three-way split release with The Coalfield and America Is Waiting ahead of their second album. The band have become seemingly inactive since the release of the album Cave Bear Is Flying Panda in early 2005 and members have not continued musical projects since. Artwork for the release was done by former 2000 AD artist  Shaky Kane.\n\n\n== Touring ==\nThe band toured with Hundred Reasons, Garrison, Hell Is For Heroes and played shows with Fugazi, Sum 41, Dead Inside, Copperpot Journals, Jerry Built, Tyler, Shoe! Chariots, Ursa Scuttle, Capdown, and Cat on Form.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nExtended Player One (EP) (2001)\n1\t \t Some Free Advice\t\t\n2\t \t When It Comes To You, I Step On Cracks\t\t\n3\t \t Post Scriptum\t\t\n4\t \t Telegram\t\t\n5\t \t Gone\n\nMosh & Go (2001)\n1\tJimmy Eat World  - \t A Praise Chorus\t\t\n2\tSan Quentin  - \t Six Seconds\t\t\n3\tStapleton  - \t Acres And Yards\t\t\n4\tKidsnear Water  - \t Distance Overtime\t\t\n5\tJetplane Landing  - \t What The Argument Has Changed\t\t\n6\tEconoline  - \t Topology\t\t\n7\tSeafood  - \tGuntrip\t\t\n8\tTwist  - \t Dent\t\t\n9\tCaffeine  - \t Love Can Wait\t\t\n10\tParkinsons, The  - \t Bad Girl\t\t\n11\tSuffrajets, The  - \t Universal Superstar\t\t\n12\tTung  - \t Kidney Failure\t\t\n13\tReuben  - \t Wooden Boy\t\t\n14\tElviss  - \t De-Change\t\t\n15\tCaretaker  - \t Hidden Agenda\t\t\n16\tHundred Reasons  - \t Slow Learner\t\t\n\nThere Is No I In Team (EP) (2001)\n1\t \t This Machine Kills\t\t\n2\t \t Starting Time\t\t\n3\t \t Queen And Three\t\t\n4\t \t Distance Over Time\t\t\n5\t \t Anniversary\n\n¡Hey Zeus!

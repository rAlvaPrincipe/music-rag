    "text": "The early-mid-1990s English band Submarine followed in the footsteps of many of its contemporaries, including The Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, Boo Radleys and My Bloody Valentine with its own vision of noise pop, before morphing into Jetboy DC, which continues sporadically to this day.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band released their self-titled debut album in 1994, produced by Keith Cleversley (of Flaming Lips fame), and released by Ultimate. A second album, also recorded with Cleversley, was turned down by the label & later released on Taky Recordings, nearly 10 years later. Kiss Me Till Your Ears Burn Off, a compilation of singles and B-sides, was released on the Fantastick Records label.\nSubmarine recorded two separate Peel Sessions for BBC presenter John Peel's radio show, in 1993 and 1994.\nDuring their career, Submarine toured extensively with such bands as the Flaming Lips, Moose, Radiohead, Peach and Tool.

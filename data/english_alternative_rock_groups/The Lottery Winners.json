    "text": "The Lottery Winners are an indie pop band from Leigh, Greater Manchester, England. The band was formed in 2008 by Thom Rylance (vocals/guitar), Robert Lally (guitar/vocals), Katie Lloyd (bass/vocals), and Joe Singleton (drums).\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2008, the band honed their craft gigging in the pubs of Leigh. They went on to self release singles and tour the UK on their own, as well as supporting many major acts including Tom Jones, Paul Weller, Shed Seven and Richard Ashcroft and more.\n\nThey were discovered at a live showcase by music mogul Seymour Stein. He went on to help them sign to Modern Sky UK in 2019 where they released their self-titled first album in 2020. Their fifth studio album ‘Anxiety Replacement Therapy’, which saw them collaborating with Frank Turner, Shaun Ryder and Boy George placed number 1 in the Official UK album chart. Lead singer, Thom Rylance, described the album as a \"self-help tape\" for those struggling in life.\nHaving played at many major festivals in 2023, including Kendal Calling, Boardmasters and Isle of Wight, they were also at Glastonbury, where they played six sets, the most by an original that year.\nTheir ’This Is How It Feels’ tour saw them sell out shows across the UK, finishing at a sold out O2 Apollo Manchester. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Original Studio Albums ===\nThe Lottery Winners (13 March 2020) – No. 23 UK\nSomething to Leave the House For (3 December 2021) – No. 11 UK\nAnxiety Replacement Therapy (28 April 2023) – No. 1 UK\nKOKO (21 February 2025)\n\n\n=== Cover Albums ===\nSounds of Isolation (21 August 2020) – No. 41 UK\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Elizabeth\" (April 2013)\n\"I Know\" (October 2015)\n\"Young Love\" (April 2016)\n\"That's Not Entertainment\" (November 2018)\n\"Hawaii\" (September 2019)\n\"Little Things\" (November 2019)\n\"21\" (January 2020)\n\"Headlock\" (February 2020)\n\"The Meaning of Life\" (March 2020)\n\"Love Will Keep Us Together\" (April 2020)\n\"An Open Letter to Creatives\" (November 2020)\n\"Start Again\" (feat.

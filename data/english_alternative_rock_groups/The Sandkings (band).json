    "text": "The Sandkings were an indie pop music band from Wolverhampton, England who had minor success in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nThey were named after a 1981 collection of sci-fi short stories by George R. R. Martin (called Sandkings).\nTheir first four singles were released on their own Long Beach Records - the first, \"Rain\", featured a singer called Andy Parton, before they recruited Jas Mann as their lead vocalist. They toured with other West Midlands bands including The Wonder Stuff, Pop Will Eat Itself and Ned's Atomic Dustbin as well as being the opening act for Happy Mondays and The Stone Roses in the early 1990s.\nMann left the band in 1992 because of creative differences, and they disbanded. Mann went on to form Babylon Zoo who had a No. 1 single with \"Spaceman\" in over 20 countries in 1996. Dodd went on to form Gravity Wheel with Brown and Producer/DJ Lee 'Peza' Perry, and released several critically acclaimed singles \"WSH\", \"Tears in the Rain\", and \"U Mudda U\", as well as the album Bulldogtunawasp. They also provided several re-mixes for other artists. Kirkbride went on to play for Southern Fly and Proud Mary, as well as touring the world with a solo Noel Gallagher (Oasis). He also is credited as playing on Oasis' album Don't Believe the Truth, and Paul Weller's 22 Dreams.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nAndy Parton: vocals (1987-1988)\nJas Mann: vocals, guitar (1988-1992)\nDave Brown: bass guitar (1987-1992)\nGlenn Dodd: guitar, backing vocals (1987-1992)\nTerry Kirkbride: drums, tambourine, backing vocals (1988-1992)\nNeil Clitheroe: drums (1987-1988)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Rain\" – 1988 – released on Long Beach Records (BEACH 1)\n\"Hope Springs Eternal\" – 1988 – 12\" single released on Long Beach Records (BEACH 2)\n\"All's Well With The World\" – August 1989 – 7\" and 12\" singles released on Long Beach Records (BEACH 3)\n\"Circles\" / \"Need To Know\" – 1990 – Double A-side 12\" single released on Long Beach Records (BEACH 4)-UK no. 122\n\"Earthwheel\" – 1990 – 7\", 12\" and CD single, released on Sugarbeach Records - UK no. 130\n\"Temple Redneck\" – 1991 – 12\" and CD single released on London Records - UK no. 100\n\"Shake Your Head\" – 1991 – 12\" and CD single, released on London Records.

A preview for a Southampton concert in the Basingstoke Gazette reported \"Hands Off Gretel's frontwoman Lauren Tate has made it her mission to ensure that strong young women have a voice in today's music industry.\" Tate is also credited for the band's videos, album artwork, and designing of the band's merchandise.\nIn 2016, they released their debut album Burn The Beauty Queen, which received praise from Ged Babey in Louder Than War:  \"a massive achievement and over-ambitious album which marks the start of a career that could well see them becoming as big as Nirvana, Marilyn Manson or Miley Cyrus over timeâ€¦.. given the breaks, and skillful management.\"\nTheir performance at The Great British Alternative Festival at Butlins in Skegness was reviewed by Vive Le Rock. Reviewer Paula Frost commented on how Tate \"entered with yet another iconic look, this time dressed in gold with lines drawn across her face [...] She knows how to get the audience snapping away.\"\nA second album I Want The World was released on 29 March 2019. Vive Le Rock's Paula Frost awarded the album 8/10, commenting \"It's not often you get a band who can emit intimidation and cuteness all at once.\"  Later that year, Tate released a new solo album, Songs for Sad Girls.\nTate has also performed as a solo artist, both predating and since the band's formation and split and also performs RnB/Hip Hop under the alias Delilah Bon.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Hands Off Gretel ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\nBurn The Beauty Queen (Hands Off Gretel, 2016)\nI Want The World (Puke Pop, 2019)\n\n\n==== Demos Album ====\n\"Bedroom Sessions'\" (Hands Off Gretel, 2016)\n\n\n==== Singles/ EPs ====\n\"Be Mine\" (Hands Off Gretel, 2015)\n\"My Size\" (Hands Off Gretel, 2016)\n\"The Angry EP\" (Puke Pop, 2020)\n\n\n==== Compilations ====\nDevolution Issue 41 - Devolution magazine\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

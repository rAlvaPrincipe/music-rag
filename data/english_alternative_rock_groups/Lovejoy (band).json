The two met from previously playing in the same folk group. Gold previously gained a following online for his Twitch streams and YouTube videos, as well as his solo music. The band was originally called \"Hang the DJ\". The current name is after Benedict Lovejoy, a friend of the band, who would sit with them during their early days of songwriting.\nBefore joining Lovejoy, drummer Mark Boardman had been studying editing at university, bass guitarist Ash Kabosu was working in TV broadcasting, and lead guitarist Joe Goldsmith was a tree surgeon. Gold met Kabosu, a friend of a friend, in a Smashburger shop in Brighton, and asked him if he'd like to join the band. During studio recording, the band hired Boardman on Fiverr, and after watching him perform, Gold invited him to join as a permanent member.\nThe band recorded their debut EP, Are You Alright?, in two days at Brighton Electric in March 2021.

From November 2022, the band began to receive attention on mainstream radio, with airtime on BBC Radio 1, and on Dutch radio show \"Welkom Bij De Club!\" (transl. Welcome to the Club!). Their songs have also been featured on BBC Music Introducing.\n\n\n=== 2023–present: Wake Up & It's Over, From Studio 4, and touring ===\n\nOn 10 February 2023, Lovejoy released the single \"Call Me What You Like\" through AWAL.

It contains acoustic versions of the songs from their debut EP, Are You Alright?, as well as a previously unreleased track, \"Tomorrow\".\nIn May 2023, the band performed in London for a Spotify event titled Our Generation. They released two songs from the session as part of Spotify Singles, including an acoustic version of \"Call Me What You Like\" and a cover of \"The Perfect Pair\" by Beabadoobee. Gold said the band had \"been huge admirers of Beabadoobee for a while now and love the melody of this song, so it was great to give it our own Lovejoy twist\".\nIn June 2023, the band appeared on the front cover of issue 77 of the music magazine Dork. On 25 June 2023, Lovejoy performed at Glastonbury Festival on the BBC Music Introducing stage.

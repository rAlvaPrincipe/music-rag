    "text": "Easyworld were an English indie alternative rock/pop band hailing from Eastbourne, consisting of David Ford on vocals, Jo Taylor on bass and Glenn Hooper on drums, active between 1997 and 2004. The band achieved limited success in the early 2000s, releasing 3 albums in total; Better Ways to Self Destruct, This Is Where I Stand and Kill the Last Romantic on Fierce Panda Records and Jive Records before parting ways in August 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation, early years and Better Ways To Self Destruct ===\nThroughout the mid-1990s, Ford and Glenn Hooper played together in several small rock bands such as Sweater, Sixteen & Sheadly. After one Sheadly gig, bassist Jo Taylor approached the band and told them that they needed her to play as their current bassist wasn't up to scratch.\nA few years passed, Sheadly had split and once again Ford and Hooper were on the look out for new band members, placing adverts for members in the window of their local music store. In a twist of fate, Jo Taylor picked up the advertisement, and the band 'Beachy Head' were formed.\nAfter recording a few rough demos and an unreleased album, the trio re-christened the band 'Easyworld', after a lyric in their song \"Better Ways To Self Destruct\". The band signed to Fierce Panda and released their debut E.P., also titled Better Ways to Self Destruct even though it did not feature the song of that name, in 2001. The E.P. was preceded by the single \"Hundredweight\".\n\n\n=== Jive Records and This Is Where I Stand (2002-2003) ===\nThe band signed to Jive Records in the fall of 2001 and released two albums, This Is Where I Stand and Kill the Last Romantic before splitting in 2004.\nThe band eventually split in 2004, before the split the band's label Jive was taken over by BMG and the band were due to re-release Kill the Last Romantic with \"How Did it Ever Come to This?\" being an additional track, with a promotional campaign being set up. However, BMG were not too keen on the band's commercial position and were due to drop them, which later prompted their split, which was revealed to Ford, when he wrote a letter to them saying he was not happy and wanted the contract cancelled.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n1.

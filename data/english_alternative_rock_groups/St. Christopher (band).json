    "text": "St. Christopher are a British indie pop group formed in York in 1984, who released several records on Sarah Records in the late 1980s, and have continued to release records since.\n\n\n== History ==\nSt. Christopher are mainly known for their four singles and 10\" mini-LP on Sarah Records, although they have a much longer history, both before and after their time on Sarah. They produced a prolific quantity of recordings on a variety of labels, from the early 1980s to the present.\nThe only constant member of the group during their more than twenty years of existence has been Glenn Melia and during this time, Melia and St. Christopher have recorded with many well-known indie labels, including Sarah, Bus Stop, Vinyl Japan, Elefant, Slumberland, Caff, and Parasol. The group probably achieved greatest recognition for the single \"All of a Tremble\", released in 1989.\nThe original line-up of the group also featured Terry Banks, who went on to lead Tree Fort Angst.\nIn 2007, a compilation album of their previous releases entitled Lost at Sea – The Sarah Recordings was released by Plastilina Records. Their last release was the CD single \"Burnout\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Crystal Clear\"/\"My Fond Farewell\". 7\" (1984) Bluegrass Records (GM001)\n\"As Far As the Eye Can See\"/\"Awe\". 7\" Grrove & Move (GM002)\n\"Go Ahead Cry . . .\"/\"Charmelle\". 7\" (1986) Groove & Move (GM003)\nForevermore Starts Here.

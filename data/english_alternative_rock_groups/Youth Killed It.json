    "text": "Youth Killed It is a British rock band formed by Jack Murphy, Josh Thexton, Josh Arter-Taylor, Ben Ford and Carlos Montero in early 2016 after changing direction from their previous project. Youth Killed It have played with bands Slaves (UK), Wonk Unit and The Sherlocks toured with the likes of The LaFontaines, MassMattiks, Goldie Lookin' Chain as well as making an appearance at the Camden Rocks, Isle of Wight Festival, Y Not, and Teddy Rocks Festivals. They signed to Rude Records in late 2016 after having released two counterpart EPs, Welcome To The Sad Boys Club and Welcome To The Happy Girls Club.\nIn 2017 the band compiled the two EP's to release their debut album ‘Modern Bollotics’ which saw single ‘Popstar’ get play-listed and shortly followed this up with stand-alone single ‘Islands’. The band swiftly followed up their debut with the full-length LP ‘What’s So Great, Britain?’ in 2018.\nIn June 2019, guitarist Carlos Montero left the band and was replaced by Danny de Ara Torres, drummer Ben Ford left the band to be replaced by Joel Mullin, and Joshua Arter-Taylor was replaced on guitars with Paul Gaul. The band have now parted ways with Rude Records to focus on being an independent band and releasing singles. In 2020 the band self released two singles 'Dad Dance Moves' and 'Muzzle Head' and in 2021: 'I Don't Care'. April 2022 saw the release of a new 4 track EP 'I'm a Believer, I just don't believe ya' which the band claim marked a new era for them. After a departure from bassist Joshua Thexton in 2022 and a sold out hometown show to a 200 capacity Norwich Waterfront Studio show in 2023, the band have prolifically secured support shows across the UK in 2024 and began releasing new music such as the highly acclaimed 'Up All Night' and have promised more new music soon.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nJack Murphy - Vocals/Guitar/Production (2016–Present)\nDanny de Ara Torres - Guitar (2019–Present)\nJoel Mullin - Drums (2019–Present)\nPaul Gaul - Guitar (2021–Present)\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nCarlos Montero - Guitar (2016-2019)\nBen Ford - Drums (2016-2019)\nJoshua Arter-Taylor - Guitar (2016-2020)\nJosh Thexton - Bass/Vocals (2016–2022)\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n== References =="

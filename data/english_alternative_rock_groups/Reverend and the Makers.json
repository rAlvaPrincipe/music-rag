    "text": "Reverend and the Makers are an English rock band from Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The band is fronted by Jon McClure, nicknamed \"The Reverend\". Their debut album, The State of Things (2007), helped them gain success in Britain and spawned the UK top 10 single \"Heavyweight Champion of the World\". The band released their second album, A French Kiss in the Chaos (2009), which led to them being invited to support Oasis on their final tour, of the first part of their career, playing venues such as Wembley Stadium. The band's third studio album, @Reverend_Makers, was released in 2012, their fourth studio album, ThirtyTwo, was released in 2014 which had more electronic and dance music influences. These were followed by Mirrors in 2015 and The Death of a King in 2017 which showcased a hard rock and folk influenced sound. Their seventh album, the soul and R&B inflected Heatwave in the Cold North was released in 2023 and became the band's first Top 10 album in the UK in 16 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nIn late 2002, McClure brought several musicians together for Reverend and the Makers. Like his previous bands, the Makers included co-songwriter Ed Cosens, this time playing bass. The rest of The Makers consisted of Dave Sanderson (guitars), Joe Moskow (keyboards), Richy Westley (drums, formerly of Hoggboy) and Laura Manuel (vocals), and occasionally Simon Strafford on trombone. Sanderson was dismissed in July 2006 after the band completed their first headline UK tour and replaced by Gledhill guitarist Tom Jarvis.\nLate in 2005, fellow Sheffield band Arctic Monkeys released their debut single, and McClure was hounded by major record labels, reportedly offering him sums of up to £150,000 to make an album like Arctic Monkeys. McClure declined the offer, and decided to do everything his own way, managing to sell out The Plug in Sheffield twice, a venue with a capacity of 1,000 people, while still unsigned. It was not until the following year that McClure met Mark Jones in a club in London when he asked him for a lighter. The two got talking and Mark Jones came to see Reverend and the Makers at the next show. Jones reportedly proclaimed the band as the \"best band in the world\" and signed them to his label Wall of Sound Records.\nReverend and The Makers released a 9-track demo in 2006, entitled \"Ten Songs\". The artwork included a track list with ten songs, track 10 being \"Paris at Night\". However this song was not made available for download; it only surfaced on the internet in August 2007. The demos were recorded at 2Fly Studios, and produced by Alan Smyth, McClure acknowledges the work Smyth put into the demos by accrediting the debut single; \"Heavyweight Champion of The World\" as McClure/Cosens/Smyth. Reverend and the Makers' music is a mix of indie guitar pop, electronica and a touch of Madchester-esque funk. Some of the internet demos feature members of other notable Sheffield musicians such as Alex Turner (Arctic Monkeys), Tim Hampton (Bromheads Jacket) and Mike Hughes (Little Ze). One of Reverend's inspirations is Manchester performance poet John Cooper Clarke and Reverend often performs his own poems, of a similar style, in between songs during his live sets. One of the B-sides to the debut single \"Heavyweight Champion of the World\" is a poem entitled \"Last Resort\" in which John Cooper Clarke and McClure read alternate stanzas. This poem was also duetted live when the band played live at Shoreditch's Spread Eagle in the first tour in May 2006.\nIn April 2006, Reverend and The Makers were support to the Arctic Monkeys on their sold out UK tour, exposing the band to larger audiences and bigger venues. This was followed by their own first UK tour in May and June, selling out dates in Shoreditch, London and The Plug in home-town Sheffield on the final night. A second tour followed in October 2006, showing great progression as a band.\n\n\n=== The State of Things and breakthrough (2007–2008) ===\n\nIn 2008, Reverend and The Makers set a date for their first release and undertook a UK tour, including several festivals over the summer period including Glastonbury Festival, Carling Weekend, T in the Park and T4 on the Beach as well as supporting the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Hampden Park, Glasgow. In January 2008, Reverend and The Makers toured Australia.\nTheir first release was \"Heavyweight Champion of the World\" on 28 May 2007 and featured the B-Sides \"18–30\" and \"The Last Resort\" featuring John Cooper Clarke. The single takes its name from a line in A Kestrel for a Knave a novel by Barry Hines and a favourite book of McClure. The single is available on both CD and 7\" vinyl formats, including a limited edition \"White Vinyl\" release. The single was released for download on 6 May and reached No. 38 in the UK single chart on download only. The album, entitled The State of Things, was recorded over the Christmas period and was released on Wall of Sound on 17 September 2007. The album features songs co-written and performed with Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys and one track co-written and with guest vocals from Tim Hampton of Bromheads Jacket, other tracks include vocals by Steve Edwards.\nIn June 2008, drummer Richy Westley left the group to form his own band Strange and Partners. In August 2008 frontman Jon McClure said he would quit music after their next album, although a month later he changed his mind. The inconsistency of McClure's actions has led many critics in the music press to report negatively towards the move. Welsh band Future of the Left joked of their delight at the band's split at live shows on their tour at the time, as can be heard on their live album Last Night I Saved Her from Vampires. Around this time McClure had a side project, Mongrel, with a single \"Hit from the Morning Sun\" released in February 2009.\n\n\n=== A French Kiss in the Chaos (2009–2010) ===\nEarly 2009, it was announced that Tom Jarvis had left the band, and had been replaced by Tom Rowley (ex-Milburn), Rowley was already a good friend of McClure, and contributed to the first album by co-writing the tracks \"Bandits\" and \"Miss Brown\".\nThe band supported Oasis, along with Kasabian and The Enemy for their sold out summer tour in 2009. The band released their follow up to 2007's The State of Things, with A French Kiss in the Chaos. The album was released in June and the opening single, \"Silence Is Talking\" was featured during the band's three night run at Wembley Stadium. The band released a second single, \"No Soap (in a Dirty War)\" in October.\nMcClure was in the media spotlight for his personal views in July 2009, after an interview in which he commented on Jade Goody's death earlier in the year; \"it's sad she died and it's good more girls are getting smear tests but let's not forget she was a talentless racist\".\nHe had also been speaking out about the UK's involvement in the Iraq War, requesting that fellow musicians, particularly Arctic Monkeys, his contemporaries from Sheffield, focus on real issues and to \"not write songs about girls at bus stops any more like me and Monkeys used to do, let's start talking about what's happening man as otherwise you know where we gonna go, we're going down the toilet aren't we?\".\nIn December 2009, it was announced via McClure's Twitter that Andy Nicholson, his fellow member in Mongrel and ex-Arctic Monkeys bassist would join the band for their third album. NME published the story on its website soon after.\n\n\n=== Hiatus and @Reverend_Makers (2010–2012) ===\nMcClure announced via his Twitter in July 2011 that \"the recording of the Reverend and The Makers third album is underway\".\nIn August 2011, the band posted a new track called \"Riot\" on their YouTube page, in response to the 2011 England riots.\nIt was announced in January 2012 that the band had completed work for the third album, scheduled for a release later that year. The band also revealed that they would be supporting Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds on their UK Arena tour in spring. The album was produced by Jason Cox and James Dring (Gorillaz) and Youth (The Verve, U2) and moved away from the political-minded nature of the band's second album. The band also announced they had signed to Cooking Vinyl Records. McClure also stated that ex-Milburn and current The Book Club frontman Joe Carnall was to join the band, as well as ex-thisGirl drummer Ryan Jenkinson.\nIn February 2012, the band played their first gig for two years in Coventry. Just days after, they released their lead single off their third album \"Bassline\" via their Facebook page. The band also announced their third album would be entitled @Reverend Makers due to \"nothing representing the modern times more than the '@' symbol\", according to McClure. The album was released on 18 June. The band appeared on Soccer AM in May 2012 and stated the next released single would be \"The Wrestler\" (which was released on 14 May 2012).\nThe album was released on 18 June 2012 and reached number 16 on the UK Albums Chart. In December 2012 the band released a live CD & DVD titled \"Reverend and The Makers Live In Sheffield\", recorded at O2 Academy Sheffield in October 2012.\n\n\n=== ThirtyTwo (2013–2014) ===\nThe band announced in October 2013 that their fourth record would be released in February 2014 and produced by Youth, James Welsh and the band. The album was titled ThirtyTwo after Jon McClure's age and was the second album on the Cooking Vinyl record Label. In the buildup to the album Jon Mclure travelled the country playing acoustic gigs in fans living rooms which they won through Twitter. On this tour, which Jon titled '32 House Gigs' there was a wedding proposal, a dog named after him and much television and press interest. The 32nd gig was held in Sheffield's Winter Gardens. The album debuted at number 5 in the midweek chart before ending the week at number 13 becoming Reverend and the Makers fourth top 20 album in a row.

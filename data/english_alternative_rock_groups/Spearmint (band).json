    "text": "Spearmint are a London-based independent band founded in 1995, comprising Shirley Lee (guitar, singing), Simon Calnan (keyboards, singing), James Parsons (guitar, bass) and Ronan Larvor (drums). \nOriginal bassist Martin Talbot left the band after five shows, being replaced  by Parsons in September 1995. Following Talbot's death, the band dedicated their debut album A Week Away to him in 1999. The dedication was repeated in 2009 when a 10th anniversary edition of the album was issued, including a new seven-song-cycle 'Life In Reverse', also in memory of Talbot.  \nAll the group's records have been released on their own 'hitBACK' label, enabling them to maintain control over their artistic output. Most recent album 'Holland Park' is the 57th release on the label. \nThe band have worked together continuously since 1995, even while Parsons released a side project by Telley in 2009, and Lee released a solo double-album in 2011. At various times, the group has also been aided by Dickon Edwards, Andy Lewis and Rhodri Marsden.\nThe group has received  coverage in the NME, Time Out, Melody Maker and Uncut magazines. and were referenced in the film (500) Days of Summer wherein Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character states “It pains me we live in a world where nobody's heard of Spearmint.”\nIn 2009, Image Comics of Berkeley, California released the book 'This Is A Souvenir', a collection of graphic novellas based on the songs of Spearmint and Shirley Lee.   \nSpearmint released their tenth album 'This Candle Is For You' in late 2023. The album was very positive received critically, with Mojo placing it at number 53 in their Top 100 albums of 2023. \n\n\n== Album discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nA Week Away (1999)\nA Different Lifetime (2001)\nMy Missing Days (2003)\nParis in a Bottle (2006)\nShirley Lee (2009)\nA Week Away re-issue including Life In Reverse (2009)\nNews from Nowhere (2014)\nIt's Time to Vanish (2016)\nAre You from the Future?

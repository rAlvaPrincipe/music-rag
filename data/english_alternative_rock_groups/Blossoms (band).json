    "text": "Blossoms are an English indie rock band from Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. Formed in 2013, the band consists of Tom Ogden (lead vocals, guitar), Charlie Salt (bass guitar, backing vocals), Josh Dewhurst (lead guitar, percussion), Joe Donovan (drums) and Myles Kellock (keyboards, synthesizer, backing vocals).\nThey were on the BBC's Sound Of new music list for 2016, finishing in fourth place. Blossoms' self-titled debut album was one of the twelve LPs nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in 2017. That same year, they were nominated for British Breakthrough Act at the Brit Awards.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Blossoms and formation ===\n\nUnknowingly at the time, all members lived within two miles of each other whilst growing up. They went to the same secondary school, though not at the same time. Two of them met at school and the others through work. Their first gig was in April 2013 at The Night and Day Café on Oldham Street, Manchester.\n\n\n=== Early work ===\n\nUpon Salt joining the band, they gained a rehearsal space, his grandfather's scaffolding yard, which they could use without paying for the time. The yard is depicted on the cover of their debut album. The band take their name from The Blossoms public house at the corner of Bramhall Lane and Buxton Road in Stockport. Donovan heard both Ogden and Salt mention how apt Blossoms was as a band name on separate occasions, leading to the naming of the band as Blossoms. They have since played shows at The Blossoms.\nIn January 2014, the band released their first single, \"You Pulled a Gun on Me\", and on 14 January 2014 they released a video for the song. The video was self-produced with a small budget of £60. \"You Pulled a Gun on Me\" was recorded at Eve Studios in Stockport. In Spring 2014, Blossoms were signed to Skeleton Key Records (owned by James Skelly of The Coral). From March through to August 2014, Blossoms embarked upon their first UK tour to promote the Bloom EP though they only played weekend shows due to all members of the band still holding full-time jobs, other than Dewhurst who was only 16 and still in full-time education. They got their first write up on the Louder Than War music website, played their first festival (Tramlines in Sheffield at Yellow Arch Studios) and opened for James at Castlefield Bowl to 8,000 people, on 11 July 2014, which they described as a turning point in the band's future. Skelly produced their first official single \"Blow\", released 26 August 2014, the video being shot at the scaffolding yard still being used as a rehearsal space.\nIn autumn 2014, Blossoms quit their jobs to fully pursue the band. They subsequently went on to do another full UK tour, this time selling out the Manchester date, hosted by Sound Control, a venue made famous by The Stone Roses and New Order. They also sold out a show at the Deaf Institute, Manchester, on 1 November 2014. Over the winter, Blossoms went back into Parr Street Studios with James Skelly to record \"Cut Me and I'll Bleed\", for which they announced an extensive UK tour between 31 January and 28 March 2015.\nDue to them having a contact in the business, the singer Liam Fray, this promoted them to tour with The Charlatans and The Courteeners in March 2015. On 18 March 2015, Blossoms were invited by BBC Introducing to play a set for the Official SXSW Showcase at Latitude 30 in Austin, Texas. Blossoms recorded and released the Blown Rose EP between June and July, the video once again shot at the scaffolding yard, released on 31 July along with the EP itself. This was the first EP released as part of Blossoms' new record deal with Virgin EMI though they only announced the new contract on 18 August 2015. The band still work with James Skelly as their producer.\nThey went on to play a summer of festivals such as The Great Escape, Y Not and Reading and Leeds whilst also supporting the Courteeners for their Heaton Park show. Blossoms headlined their first festival stage on 5 September 2015 at Tim Peak's Diner as part of Festival No. 6.\nThis was released as a 10\" vinyl disc for Record Store Day 2017.\n\n\n=== Blossoms ===\nRecording for the debut album began in September 2015. On 4 October 2015, Blossoms announced that their next single would be \"Charlemagne\". It was released on iTunes and Spotify on 5 October 2015. On 30 October 2015, the Charlemagne EP was released featuring three other songs (\"Across the Moor\", \"For Evelyn\" and \"Polka Dot Bones\"). \"Charlemagne\" went on to commercial success and became BBC Radio 1's track of the day and featured on Spotify's 'Spotlight on 2016' list. The commercial success extended through to December, when Charlemagne topped the Christmas vinyl chart.\nOn 5 January 2016, Blossoms announced their At Most a Kiss EP and released the song, with the video following. Whilst doing promotion for the EP Blossoms played the Radio 1 Live Lounge, covering WSTRN's \"In2\". They announced on 22 January 2016 that recording for their debut album was complete. Whilst on their third headline tour Blossoms had support from Viola Beach, who were killed mid-tour in a car crash with their manager on 13 February 2016. Blossoms played a recorded set from a Royal Leamington Spa performance for the remaining tour dates in the slot Viola Beach would have otherwise played in.\nThe At Most a Kiss EP was released on 23 February 2016. They were nominated for Best Breakthrough Act at the 37th Brit Awards but lost to Rag'n'Bone Man. On 12 April 2016, Annie Mac played their song \"Getaway\" for the first time on BBC Radio 1 before a midnight release of the single on iTunes and Spotify. In May it was announced that Blossoms would play their biggest show to date and support the Stone Roses at Etihad Stadium on 15 June 2016, after Ian Brown became a fan of the band. Once again Blossoms are playing a summer of festivals, being clocked up to 41 festivals by Dewhurst. Blossoms' eponymous debut album was released on 5 August with \"My Favourite Room\" and \"Honey Sweet\" being released to pre-orders early as singles. It was met with mostly favourable reviews and peaked at the top of the UK Albums Chart in its first week, giving Blossoms their first number-one album. Blossoms featured on the August cover of NME magazine. An autumn tour to support the album release also sold out including a performance at Stockport's Plaza Theatre at midnight on the day of the album's release.\nOn 9 September 2017, Blossoms performed at Manchester Arena as part of We Are Manchester, an event to mark  reopening of the venue following a terrorist attack there three months prior.\n\n\n=== Cool Like You ===\nCool Like You was their second studio album. It was released in the United Kingdom on 27 April 2018, by Virgin EMI Records. The album was produced by James Skelly and Rich Turvey. It peaked at number 4 on the UK Albums Chart, and at number 1 on the Official Vinyl Albums Chart. Subsequently, after this, the band followed up the album's release with a UK tour which was completely sold out, including a night at the O2 Apollo in Manchester and three shows at Stockport Plaza. After playing some festivals in the summer, Blossoms announced another UK tour for December, including two nights at Manchester's O2 Victoria Warehouse and the O2 Brixton Academy in London. The entire tour sold out within minutes on the day tickets went on sale.\nIn June 2019 Blossoms played a homecoming show at Edgeley Park Stadium, selling out every ticket in under an hour.\n\n\n=== Foolish Loving Spaces ===\nThe band released their third album, Foolish Loving Spaces, on 31 January 2020. Preceded by the singles \"Your Girlfriend\", \"The Keeper\" and \"If You Think This Is Real Life\", it went to number 1 on the UK album charts. In November 2020, they premiered a 90-minute long documentary entitled \"Blossoms: Back to Stockport\" on YouTube and Amazon Prime.\nIn April 2021 they made national headlines when they were announced as headlining a one-day \"trial\" festival at Sefton Park on 2 May that year. The festival was notable as the first major festival in the UK for 14 months with no social distancing or face masks, following the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2021, they teamed up with Rick Astley, performing covers of The Smiths songs. The band announced further performances with Astley on 8 and 9 October 2021 and went on to play with him at the 2023 Glastonbury Festival.\n\n\n=== Ribbon Around The Bomb ===\nThe band released their fourth album, Ribbon Around The Bomb, on 29 April 2022. It reached number 1 on the UK album charts, their third time achieving this.\n\n\n=== Gary ===\nThe band's fifth album, Gary, was released on 20 September 2024 and was No 1 on the UK Albums Chart a week later. Produced by J Lloyd and James Skelly, the album is named after an 8-foot (2.4 m) fibreglass gorilla that was stolen from a Lanarkshire garden centre in early 2023.\n\n\n== Members ==\nTom Ogden – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, harmonica\nCharlie Salt – bass, guitar, backing vocals\nJosh Dewhurst – lead guitar, percussion\nJoe Donovan – drums\nMyles Kellock – keyboards, synthesizer, piano, backing vocals\n\n\n=== Touring ===\nRyan Ellis – guitar\nCollette Williams – percussion, backing vocals\nDan Woolfie – guitar, percussion, backing vocals\nJohn Simm – drums, percussion\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nBlossoms (2016)\nCool Like You (2018)\nFoolish Loving Spaces (2020)\nRibbon Around the Bomb (2022)\nGary (2024)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nBlossoms at AllMusic\nBlossoms discography at Discogs \nBlossoms at IMDb"

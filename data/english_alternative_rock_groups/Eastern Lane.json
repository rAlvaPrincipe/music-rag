    "text": "Eastern Lane were an English indie band from Berwick-upon-Tweed, comprising Derek Meins (vocals/guitar), Andrew Lawton (guitar), Stuart Newlands (bass) and Danny Ferguson (drums). Their name was taken from a street in their hometown. The band was formed in 2001.\nThe band released two albums: Shades of Black in 2003 and The Article in 2005. Both albums are on the Rough Trade label. Their song, \"Feed Your Addiction\" was featured in an HSBC advertisement.\nIn late 2006 the band went their separate ways, according to a posting on the band's MySpace site, the split was down to the fact they have been unable to release any new material \"due to circumstances with labels and money etc.\"\nDerek Meins is now pursuing a solo career, performing and releasing as The Agitator.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nLast Excerpt (2002)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial website of The Agitator"

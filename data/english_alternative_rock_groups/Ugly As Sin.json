    "text": "Ugly As Sin were an English post-punk/pop rock band from London formed in 1989.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band Ugly As Sin was formed by singer-songwriter Ian Walker and was signed to China Records. As a second founding member Boris Pikula (ex-Andi Sexgang, Huckleberry Finn) joined in July 1989, followed by Fiona Lawrence in August 1989. As this trio, the band was to be commercially marketed by the record company, thus the album title The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\nIn mid-1989, the recording of the debut album started, being engineered and produced on 16-track by Paul Mex at Mex One Recordings in Watford. It was released in the beginning of 1990.\nThe band's first gig was on 3 October 1989 at The King's Head, Fulham, London, supporting the supergroup Havana 3am (ex-Clash members) on tour. Their second tour was supporting the Brixton rock-trio Under Neath What, going straight into their third tour supporting the Stranglers throughout the UK (96 Tours, their last featuring Hugh Cornwell).\n\n\n== Tours and shows ==\n\n\n=== Havana 3am, support ===\nOct 3 1989 - London Kings Head\nOct 5 1989 - Newcastle Polytechnic\nOct 11 1989 - Kent University\nOct 12 1989 - London ULU (own show)\nOct 19 1989 - Uxbridge Brunel University\nOct 20 1989 - Reading After Dark\nOct 21 1989 - Manchester University\nOct 24 1989 - Doncaster\nOct 29 1989 - Swamsea University\nOct 30 1989 - Cardiff University\n\n\n=== Under Neath What, support ===\nFeb 5 1990 - Newcastle Riverside\nFeb 6 1990 - Carlisle Pagoda\nFeb 7 1990 - Leeds Duchess of York\nFeb 8 1990 - Birmingham University\nFeb 9 1990 - Banbury Football Club\nFeb 11 1990 - Doncaster The Jug\nFeb 12 1990 - Lincoln New Vienna\nFeb 13 1990 - Leicester Princess Charlotte\nFeb 14 1990 - Manchester University\nFeb 15 1990 - Bristol Bierkeller\nFeb 16 1990 - King's Lynn La's\nFeb 17 1990 - London Marquee\n\n\n=== The Stranglers - 96 Tours, support ===\nFeb 19 1990 - Bristol Colston Hall\nFeb 20 1990 - Poole Arts Centre\nFeb 21 1990 - Torbay Lesure Centre\nFeb 22 1990 - Newport Centre\nFeb 23 1990 - Leicester De Montford Hall\nFeb 24 1990 - London Brixton Academy\nFeb 26 1990 - Crawley Leisure Centre\nFeb 27 1990 - Nottingham Royal Concert Hall\nFeb 28 1990 - Newcastle City Hall\nMarch 1, 1990 - Wolverhampton Civic Hall\nMarch 2, 1990 - Bradford St Georges Hall\nMarch 4, 1990 - Aberdeen Capitol\nMarch 5, 1990 - Edinburgh Playhouse\nMarch 6, 1990 - Carlisle Sands Centre\nMarch 7, 1990 - Preston Guildhall\nMarch 8, 1990 - Scarborough Futurist Theartre\nMarch 9, 1990 - Manchester Apollo\nMarch 10, 1990 - Sheffield City Hall\nMarch 11, 1990 - Birmingham Humingbird\nMarch 13, 1990 - Portsmouth Guildhall\nMarch 14, 1990 - Glouchester Leisure Centre\nMarch 16, 1990 - Folkestone Leas Cliff Hall\nMarch 17, 1990 - Cambridge Corn Exchange\nMarch 18, 1990 - Reading Hexagon\nMarch 19, 1990 - Guildford Civic Hall\nMarch 20, 1990 - Southend Cliffs Pavilion\nMarch 21, 1990 - London Brixton Academy\n\n\n=== Own shows ===\nFeb 23 1990 - London Goldsmith College\nMar 15 1990 - Manchester U-Mist\nMar 23 1990 - Uxbridge Brunel University\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1990, China Records)\nThe Good, the Bad and the Bootleg (4-song EP, 1990, China Records)\n\"Terminal Love\" / \"Wasted\" (single, 1989, China Records)\n\"Pain\" / \"Terminal Dub\" (single, 1990, China Records)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUgly As Sin discography at Discogs\nBoris Pikula discography at Discogs\nPaul Mex discography at Discogs"

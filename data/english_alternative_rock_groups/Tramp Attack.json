After quickly gaining an enthusiastic and loyal fanbase, the band secured residencies in the pubs and clubs of Liverpool and went on to win a Battle Of The Bands at The Royal Court.\nThe band released their debut single 'Rocky Hangover' written by Redmond and McCabe in 2001 on Honey Records. The single was produced by Rob Ferrier at Great Northern Studios with B sides 'Broken Man'(written by McCabe) and 'Ladybird' (written by Redmond). Soon after the release of the single, the band split with Dave McCabe going on to form The Zutons and Kristian Ealey working with Edgar Jones in an early lineup of his 'Edgar Jones & the Joneses' band with Candie Payne.\nMatt Barton and Ian Lane continued working together as The Mother Lovers, and released 'Rex' under that name on 'The Great Liverpool Acoustic Experiment' compilation album in 2002. After recruiting Chris Marshall and Barry Southern, the duo renamed themselves Tramp Attack and gigged regularly across Liverpool, including several shows at The Bandwagon night held at The Zanzibar. Liverpool at the time was attracting much interest from record labels large and small, and Tramp Attack proceeded to release records through the London-based Must Destroy record label, such as the band's first album 'Attack, Attack, Attack...'\nIn the summer of 2006 the band's second album 'Call In Sick' was released on The Viper Label. Following a brief break-up at the start of 2007 the band returned to record a new set of songs adding Tony Dunne back into the line up on keyboards. Tramp Attack continue to perform throughout the city of Liverpool and further afield, such as at the Coniston Festival.\nIn May 2016, former vocalist Kristian Ealey died aged 38 in Italy.\nIn January 2022, the track 'Oh! When the Sun Goes Down' from the album 'Attack, Attack, Attack...' was featured during the opening titles of the first episode of the BBC drama The Responder.\nIn April 2022, the band self released an album compiled of previously unreleased recordings titled 'I Got Lost Down the Back of My Couch'. \nFormer bassist, James Redmond released his debut solo album titled Video City 2 in April 2023 through AV8 Records Ltd. \nIt features both Ian Lane and Dave McCabe.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nMatt Barton (a.k.a.

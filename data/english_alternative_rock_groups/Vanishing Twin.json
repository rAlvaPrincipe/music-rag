    "text": "Vanishing Twin are a London-based experimental trio, founded in 2015. The group is led by singer and guitarist Cathy Lucas, formerly a member of Fanfarlo, and have released four albums: Choose Your Own Adventure (2016),  The Age of Immunology (2019), Ookii Gekkou (2021), and \"Afternoon X\" (2023). The band's name refers to the fetal absorption of Lucas's twin during pregnancy.\nThe band consists of Cathy Lucas on vocals, Valentina Magaletti on drums (whose credits include Bat for Lashes and Gruff Rhys’ Neon Neon project), and bassist Susumu Mukai (aka Zongamin). Lucas was previously a member of Fanfarlo. \"The group’s cosmopolitan membership initially reflected its mission to synthesize psychedelic traditions around the globe, from tropicalía to kosmische rock.\" Their sound has been compared to the band Stereolab and is described as Brazilian psych-jazz as well as a psychedelic, experimental pop ensemble.\nIn 2016 their debut album, Choose Your Own Adventure, was released on Soundway Records. In 2017, they released the EP Dream By Numbers. Their second album, The Age of Immunology, was released in 2019 on Fire Records. On 15 October 2021, they released their third album, Ookii Gekkou, again on Fire Records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nChoose Your Own Adventure (2016)\nThe Age of Immunology (2019)\nOokii Gekkou (2021)\nAfternoon X (2023)\nEPs\n\nDream by Numbers (2017)\nBetween Magic & Machines (2018)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Vanishing Twin at Wikimedia Commons"

    "text": "The Moonies were an alternative rock band from Liverpool, England that existed from 2001 to 2005. The band consisted of singer/guitarist Steve Banks, singer/bassist Ryan Clarke, guitarist Steve Charmley, and drummer Mike Berry.\n\n\n== History ==\nBanks, Clarke, and Berry were members of the Moggs, who released an album titled Sweet Corn & Soft Porn for Foulplay Records in 2000. The Moggs lost their recording contract, and in 2001 recruited Charmley and adopted the new name the Moonies as a tribute to Keith Moon. Under this name they signed with EMI. The band was known for their emo-oriented sound mixed with lyrics and fashion styles reminiscent of 1960s British rock. \nThe band released several singles in the UK starting in 2002, and released the album It's Amazing! in Japan in 2003. They toured the UK several times with the Buzzcocks and recorded an unreleased song featuring Buzzcocks singer Pete Shelley. Charmley left the Moonies in 2004, followed by Banks in 2005, after which the group disbanded.\n\n\n== Members ==\nSteve Banks (vocals/guitar)\nRyan Clarke (vocals/bass)\nMike Berry (drums)\nSteve Charmley (guitar)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nThe Rock and Roll EP (EP, 2003)\nIt's Amazing!

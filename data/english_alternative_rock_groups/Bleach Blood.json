Their debut album All Sides of a Circle, is set to be released via Transmission Record in March 2015, from which three singles, \"Anything Anything\", \"H.O.P.E.\" and \"Pleased To Meet You\", have already been released.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and \"Let Your Heart Sing\" EP (2012) ===\nThree months after The King Blues split up, guitarist Jamie Jazz had been debating whether to stay in music or to \"get a real job\". He began working on some new \"really, really, REALLY punk\" material, before arriving at the songs which would comprise the Let Your Heart Sing EP. Jazz and Mullen lived near to each other which led to Jazz playing some of his new material to Mullen, who then introduced him to Charlie Elliot and Paul Lane.\nAfter releasing and recording the \"Let Your Heart Sing\" EP, tracks were played by BBC Radio 1, Kerrang! Radio and Xfm among others, including a Radio 1 Live Lounge performance for Mike Davies on 23 January 2013, where the next single, \"Anything Anything\" (featuring Linda Harrison), was played for the first time.\n\n\n=== \"Darling Don't Dive EP\" (2014) and new line up ===\nIn 2014, Bleach Blood released their \"Darling Don't Dive EP\" for free through their website. On this EP were three new songs and a reworked rendition of \"Anything, Anything\" ft. Linda Harrison. \"Darling Don't Dive without me\" was released for Radio airplay and was Single of the week on XFM Radio. \nBleach Blood returned in July 2014 with a new line-up and announced the release of their new single for 12 October titled \"Pleased to Meet You\"\nTheir debut album has been recorded and due to be released early 2015.\n\n\n=== All Sides of a Circle (2015) ===\nBleach Blood announced in January 2015 that their debut album All Sides of a Circle would be released on 2 March 2015 via Transmission Recordings.

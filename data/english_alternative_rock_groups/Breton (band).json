    "text": "Breton was an English band from London, consisting of lead vocalist and guitarist Roman Rappak, drummer Adam Ainger, programmer Ian Patterson, bassist Daniel Tate McIlvenny, and visual artist Ryan McClarnon.\nRappak and Ainger began playing together around 2007, but the full group did not coalesce until several years later. They envisioned themselves as a multimedia artist collective, working from a former NatWest bank building in Elephant and Castle which they dubbed Breton Labs. The group released three extended plays and did remixes for artists such as Tricky, Alt J, The Temper Trap, Lana Del Rey and Local Natives. The group signed to Fatcat Records in 2011 and released their debut full-length, Other People's Problems, early the following year.\nFor much of 2012 and 2013, the band played around Europe while writing material in preparation for a follow-up album. As their own studios had been earmarked for demolition, the five-piece moved to Berlin to record the new album. They set up their own label and signed with Believe Recordings (UK) and released the singles \"Envy\" and \"Got Well Soon\" by the end of 2013. In early February 2014, the album War Room Stories was released.\nBreton's single \"Got Well Soon\" was included in episode 4 of Life Is Strange, an episodic video game made by Dontnod Entertainment in 2015, as the first song played inside the Vortex Club. This caused a rise in popularity of the single. But \"Edward The Confessor\" was their first ever single to be included in any video game. The single was included in Sleeping Dogs, an action-adventure video game developed by United Front Games and published by Square Enix's European subsidiary in 2012 as one of the songs in the in-game \"Kerrang! radio\". The following year, their single \"The Commission\" was included in Asphalt 8: Airborne, a racing video game made by Gameloft as one of the main menu themes.\nIn February 2019, Rappak confirmed the splitting of the band through posts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\nFinal line-up\n\nAdam Ainger - drums (2007–2019)\nRoman Rappak - lead vocals, guitar (2007–2019)\nDaniel Tate McIlvenny - bass guitar, keyboards, synthesizers (2010–2019)\nIan Patterson - beats (2010–2019)\nRyan McClarnon - visuals (2012–2019)\nFormer\n\nAlex Wadey (2010–2011)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nPractical EP (Strange Torpedo, 2010)\nSharing Notes EP (BretonLabs, 2010)\nCounter Balance EP (Hemlock Recordings, 2011)\nBlanket Rule EP (2012)\nEscalation EP (BretonLabs, 2013)\nForce of Habit EP (Cut Tooth / Believe Recordings, 2013)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nCharting\n\nOther singles\n\"Edward the Confessor\" (Fat Cat Records, 2011)\n\"Interference\" (Fat Cat Records, 2012)\n\"Jostle\" (Fat Cat Records, 2012)\n\"Population Density\" (Fat Cat Records, 2012)\n\"Remixed 12\"\" (Fat Cat Records, 2013)\n\"Got Well Soon\" (Cut Tooth / Believe Recordings, 2013)\n\"Envy\" (Cut Tooth / Believe Recordings, 2013)\n\n\n== References =="

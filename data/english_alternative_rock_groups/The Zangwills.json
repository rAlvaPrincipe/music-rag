They really rock\" from the USA   and \"The UK does not stop producing bands that immediately make us fall in love, for example, The Zangwills.\" from Germany\nPublic attention and media comments such as \"The Zangwills have proven their capability to consistently produce engaging indie-rock bangers\"  led to them passing the early milestone of a million streams on Spotify.

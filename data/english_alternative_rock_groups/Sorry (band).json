    "text": "Sorry (previously named Fish) is an English indie rock band from North London. The band members are Asha Lorenz, Louis O'Bryen, Lincoln Barrett, Campbell Baum and Marco Pini. The band's debut studio album, 925, was released in 2020, following the release of several mixtapes and singles. \nSorry is signed to the London-based independent record label Domino.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early releases ===\nLorenz and O'Bryan published several covers of Jimi Hendrix songs before embarking on original projects. Between 2017 and 2020, Sorry released various singles and mixtapes containing original material, much of which would later appear on the band's debut studio album.  To this day, Lorenz and O'Bryan write the majority of their songs as a duo while Barrett, Baum and Pini complete the band for live sets. \n\n\n=== Debut studio album and tour ===\nOn 27 March 2020, Sorry released its debut studio album, 925. It contains four previously released singles: \"More\", \"Right Round the Clock\", \"Snakes\" and \"Starstruck\". On Metacritic, it has a score of 79, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Many critics praised the album's cohesiveness and innovative sound. Stereogum named 925 \"album of the week\" on 24 March 2020. A less favorable Guardian review stated that \"925 packs in more than a few disruptive ideas. But Sorry haven't yet acquired the musical vocabulary to pull them off.\" \nThe album charted on the UK Independent Albums Chart, where it peaked at number 13, and on the Scottish Albums Chart, where it peaked at number 49. The band planned to embark on a UK headlining tour to promote the album's release but had to postpone the tour dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn February 2021, Sorry announced a live album recorded at the South London venue Windmill, Brixton, with proceeds going toward the venue, which faced financial difficulties in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n=== Anywhere But Here ===\nOn 12 July 2022, Sorry announced their second album, Anywhere but Here. It was released on 7 October through Domino Records, along with its first single, \"Let the Lights On\". The album was recorded with Portishead's Adrian Utley.\n\n\n== Genres ==\nSorry's musical influences have caused debate amongst music critics and reviewers, many of whom refrain from sorting the band into a single genre. The Guardian has stated that \"A typical Sorry track is just as likely to be inflected with 90s grunge as with jazz or trip-hop\", thus defying traditional genre labels and categories.  Lorenz and O'Bryen themselves have described their musical output as pop with O'Bryen commenting that \"It's just a bit annoying to be called post-punk or grunge because I don't think we are that.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nAsha Lorenz – lead vocals, guitars, production\nLouis O'Bryen – guitars, co-lead and backing vocals, production\nLincoln Barrett – drums\nCampbell Baum – bass guitar, instrumentation\nMarco Pini – electronics, production\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAdapted from Spotify.\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\n\n\n==== Live albums ====\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Lonely the Brave are an English alternative rock band from Cambridge. They were formed in 2008. The members include Jack Bennett (vocals), Mark Trotter (lead guitar), Gavin Edgeley (drums), Andrew Bushen (bass), and Ross Smithwick (rhythm guitar) who joined the band in 2014. The band takes inspiration from an eclectic set of sources, such as Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam and Deftones. One journalist remarked that this culminates into \"Biffy Clyro-shaped stadium rock\".\nOn 11 March 2018 the band announced, via a heartfelt email to fans, that David Jakes would be leaving for mental health reasons. In August 2018, he was subsequently replaced by Jack Bennett. In April 2020 the band released their first material with Bennett on Easy Life Records; the single “Bound” was premiered on BBC Radio One.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent  \n\nMark Trotter (lead guitar/backing vocals)\nGavin Edgeley (drums/backing vocals)\nAndrew Bushen (bass guitar)\nRoss Smithwick (rhythm guitar/backing vocals)\nJack Bennett (lead vocals)\nFormer\n\nJoel Mason (rhythm guitar)\nDavid Jakes (lead vocals)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nLonely the Brave's channel on YouTube"

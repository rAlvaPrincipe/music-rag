Their debut album, Matador, reached Top 50 in the UK Album Sales Charts with tracks appearing across BBC Radio 1, Radio 2 and 6 Music. Their 2024 album, Western Approaches, charted at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAll six members originally played in separate bands before forming in 2016, with many of them never having met before sharing a rehearsal space. They quickly bonded musically, aided by their extracurricular activities, including weekly boxing sessions together. \nRed Rum Club have stated that Bootle – and its seafaring, industrial heritage – plays a big role in the record's sound. Their frequent tours of the United States also influence their musical style.\nRed Rum Club have had tours around the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as concerts in Romania, South Korea and Sweden.\nThey have been compared to fellow scouse bands such as The Zutons.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References =="

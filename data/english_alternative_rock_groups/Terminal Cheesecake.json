    "text": "Terminal Cheesecake are an English alternative rock band, originally formed by Gary Boniface (formerly of The Purple Things and The Vibes), Russell Smith (formerly of A.R.Kane and MARRS), Mick Parkin and John Jobbagy (also from The Vibes and Purple Things) in 1988 in North and East London.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name of the group was taken from a list of fictional 1960s bands written by Nick Saloman of The Bevis Frond.\nTerminal Cheesecake were the first group to sign to Wiiija Records - their debut record, 1988's \"Bladdersack\" EP was also the first release on the label. Two albums for Wiiija followed in 1989.\nThe band recorded a John Peel Session in April 1990. This was followed by a third album, Angels In Pigtails which was released on Kevin Martin's Pathological label and described by rock critic Simon Reynolds as \"an epic of ruination\".\nRussell Smith of the group was also a member of noise rock band Skullflower and one hit sampling wonders MARRS.\nTerminal Cheesecake ceased activity in 1995. The group reformed in 2013 with Neil Francis from the band Gnod replacing Boniface as vocalist.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nJohnny Town-Mouse (Wiiija Records, 1989)\nV.C.L.

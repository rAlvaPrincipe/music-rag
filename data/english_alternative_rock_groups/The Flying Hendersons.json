In early 1988, they played their last gig at the Infamous Asylum Club, Manchester and then disbanded.\nTheir only recording that survived from the 1987 Nyrex studio sessions in Manchester was the non released single, \"Scam Man\" / \"Electric Hands\", which to this date has never been officially released into the public domain.\nIn 1989, Jules and Steve linked up with Leeds band The Kennedy Pill. After a nationwide tour they released their only single, \"Beside the Sea\", before disappearing into obscurity.

Bill moved to Manchester and then later, left the UK to live and work overseas in Moscow and the Middle East. Meanwhile, Graham pursued a teaching career. The band's influences were extremely varied however there was some leaning towards the Leeds gothic rock scene at the time, with such bands as The Sisters of Mercy, The March Violets and The Mission providing a source of inspiration for the lyrics and style, especially in the early days of the band.\nThe Flying Henderson's were contemplating a comeback gig in 2017 to mark their 30th anniversary. Nothing came of this venture.\n\n\n== Original line up 1986-88 ==\nGraham Charles (Vocals)\nRobert (Bill) Mills (Drums)\nJulian Coultas (Guitar)\nSteve Whitfield (Bass)\n\n\n== Nynex recordings 1986-7 (studio) ==\n\"Ghost of Time\"\n\"Electric Hands\"\n\"Scam Man\"\n\"Run (Mescaline trip)\"\n\"Seventh Reflection\"\n\"Luxury\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYoutube video\nYoutube video 2"

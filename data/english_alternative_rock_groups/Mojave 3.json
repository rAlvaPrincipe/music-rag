    "text": "Mojave 3 were a British rock band consisting of former Slowdive members Neil Halstead (vocals, guitar), Rachel Goswell (vocals, guitar) and Ian McCutcheon (drums) alongside keyboardist Alan Forrester and former Chapterhouse guitarist Simon Rowe.\nThe band formed as a trio shortly after Slowdive's breakup in 1995, with Forrester and Rowe joining after the release of their debut album. Mojave 3 released five albums before going on a hiatus. The band returned to live performances in 2011 but permanently ceased after Goswell and Halstead reformed Slowdive.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band initially existed as a trio, consisting of Neil Halstead, Rachel Goswell, and McCutcheon. After Slowdive were dropped by Creation Records, the trio decided to change musical direction to a dream pop/country rock/folk music style, and were signed by 4AD Records. They took on the new name \"Mojave,\" but upon the discovery of another band already using the name, the \"3\" was added (in reference to the group's three members). Rowe (formerly of Chapterhouse) and Forrester joined shortly after the release of their first album.\nBoth Halstead (the main songwriter for the band) and Goswell have released solo albums, also for 4AD. McCutcheon founded the band The Loose Salute, who are signed to Heavenly Records and Graveface Records.\nHalstead said the band was on hiatus as of 2008, but were planning to release at least one more album in the future.  The band returned to playing live in 2011, including gigs supporting Band of Horses. During a radio interview on Israeli radio station Kol HaCampus on 7 May 2011, Halstead said the band were working on new material, and may be recording during the summer; however, nothing materialized.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nAsk Me Tomorrow (16 October 1995) CAD 5013\nOut of Tune (5 October 1998) CAD 8018\nExcuses for Travellers (15 May 2000) CAD 2K05\nSpoon and Rafter (22 September 2003) CAD 2309\nPuzzles Like You (19 June 2006) CAD 2604\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nSingles\n\n\"Who Do You Love\" (29 June 1998) BAD 8011\n\"Some Kinda Angel\" (7 September 1998) BAD 8016\n\"In Love with a View\" (3 April 2000) TAD 2K03\n\"Any Day Will Be Fine\" (1 May 2000) BAD 2K04\n\"Return to Sender\" (11 September 2000) BAD 2K17\n\"Breaking the Ice\" (5 June 2006) BAD 2602\n\"Puzzles Like You\" (6 November 2006) AD 2615\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMojave 3 at 4AD\nMojave 3 Gigography\nMojave 3 at musicOMH.com\nMojave 3 at AllMusic\nMojave 3 at the Internet Archive's live music archive\nReview of Puzzles Like You at Subculture Magazine"

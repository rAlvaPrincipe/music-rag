    "text": "New Fast Automatic Daffodils (later shortened to New FADS) were an alternative rock group from Manchester, England, active between 1988 and 1995.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed in 1988 by Dolan Hewison (guitar), Justin Crawford (bass), Perry Saunders (drums) in Hulme whilst students at Manchester Polytechnic, the line-up was complete when Andy Spearpoint, who at the time was at drama school in Manchester, joined on vocals. The name comes from a poem by Adrian Henri that mixed an advertisement for the Dutch DAF car with the Wordsworth poem \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\". Often associated with the Madchester scene of the late 1980s, but never really part of that scene, taking more inspiration from post punk labels such as Postcard Records, the band's debut single, \"Lions\" was released in 1989 on Playtime Records (then home to Inspiral Carpets), followed the same year by the Music Is Shit EP. In 1990, after the success of their breakthrough single \"Big\" they signed to Play It Again Sam Records, September of that year seeing the release of \"Fishes Eyes\", and debut album Pigeonhole appearing in November, which reached the UK top 50.\nThey developed a brilliant live reputation touring the UK, Europe and the US having secured deals with Mute / Elektra in the States. Further singles followed in 1991 working with legendary Factory producer Martin Hannett on a rerecorded version of \"Get Better\". and in 1992 they de-camped to Belgium to work with the equally famous Craig Leon on their second album Body Exit Mind, a more experimental record that was mostly recorded in live takes trying to capture the elusive live performances the band were famed for. Released in October 1992 and reaching No. 57 in the UK it spawned two NME singles of the week with 'Its Not What You Know\" and \"Stockholm\" which became a top 10 college radio hit in the US. 1994 saw the band shorten their name to New FADS, with 2 EPs released that year, before a final album, Love It All in 1995. The band split up in 1995.\nThe band recorded three sessions for John Peel's radio show, the first two of which were compiled onto an album, The Peel Sessions in 1991. Their song \"Big\" also reached No. 14 in the Festive Fifty in 1990 and featured on the influential 1990 compilation album Happy Daze. Their lone charting success in the United States was the single \"Stockholm\", which reached No. 30 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts in 1993.\nSinger Andy Spearpoint also flirted with acting, having a small part in Coronation Street.\n\n\n== Post band activities ==\nAndy Spearpoint now lives in Ireland and is embarking on an MA in music. Dolan Hewison is Managing Director of the ad agency Ear to the Ground and has recently released an album under the name Au-Turn. Icarus Wilson-Wright as well as working with Basement Jaxx as a percussionist is also a Video Artist working with Massive Attack and also exhibiting in the Turbine Hall at the Tate Modern. Justin Crawford is one part of DJ duo Unabombers and the infamous Electric Chair night as well as a prolific career as an artist recording solo under the name Only Child.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Lions\" (1989, Playtime) 12\" tracks:\nLions\nFate Don't Fail Me Now\nYour Dreams My Nightmares\n\"Music Is Shit\" EP (1989, Playtime) 12\" tracks:\nBeam Me Up\nA Man Without Qualities\nMusic Is Shit parts 1-3\nCD version (AMUSE 6CD) contained an extra track Lions, taken from the first 12”\n\n\"Big\" (1990 Amuse 7CD, Playtime) UK No. 109\ncd tracks:\n\nBig 6:13\nBig (Baka) 6:30\nBig (Instrumental) 6:32\n\"Fishes Eyes\" (1990 BIAS162 CD, Play It Again Sam) UK No. 77\ncd tracks:\n\nFishes Eyes 6:46\nFishes Eyes (Underwater) 5:19\nWhite 3:51\n\"Get Better\" (1991 BIAS193 CD, Play It Again Sam) UK No. 85\ncd tracks:\n\nGet Better 4:30\nPigeonhole (Edit) 4:52\nI Found Myself in Another Room 3:52\nGet Better (Version 1) 4:29\n\"All Over My Face\" (1991 BIAS199 CD, Play It Again Sam) UK No. 96\ncd tracks:\n\nAll Over My Face 3:53\nAll Over My Face (Split Decision) 5:20\nAll Over My Face (Off the Road) 4:56\nWhy The Hard Man Fail 4:42\n\"Big\" (1991, Playtime, Play It Again Sam & Mute) cd tracks:\nBig (Edit) 4:12\nBig (Baka) 6:30\nGet Better 4:30\nGet Better (Extended) 6:30\nWhite 3:50\n\"It's Not What You Know\" (1992, Play It Again Sam) UK No. 82\ncd tracks:\n\nIt's Not What You Know 4:07\nHead On 3:28\nBeatlemania 4:50\nBeautiful 4:40\n\"Stockholm\" (1992, Play It Again Sam) UK No. 89\ncd tracks:\n\nStockholm 5:10\nStockholm (Edit) 4:12\nCannes 4:25\n10\" tracks:\n\nStockholm (Demo Version)\nIt's Not What You Know (Demo Version)\nHexagon Spring\n\"Bong\" (1993, Play It Again Sam) cd tracks:\nBong 4:06\nIt's Not What You Know 4:08\nHead On 3:28\nBeautiful 4:40\nCannes 4:25\n\"Life Is An Accident 1\" (1994 BIAS249 CD1, Play It Again Sam) (as New FADS) cd tracks:\nLife Is An Accident 3:02\nEvery Once In A While (Fuzzy Logic) 6:04\nAches And Pains 3:50\n\"Life Is An Accident 2\" (1994 BIAS249 CD2, Play It Again Sam) (as New FADS) cd tracks:\nLife Is An Accident 3:02\nPSV (VPL) 7:55\nMad Pop 3:03\n\"These Foolish Things\" (1994, Play It Again Sam) (as New FADS) 10\" tracks:\nThese Foolish Things 4:31\nEvery Once In A While 4:15\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nPigeonhole (1990, Play It Again Sam) UK No. 49 cd tracks:\nGet Better 3:52\nFishes Eyes 7:04\nWorking for Him 4:17\nPart 4 4:13\nBig 6:08\nYou Were Lying When You Said You Loved Me 4:17\nAmplifier 3:57\nReprise 3:47\nPartial 6:26\nPenguins 3:51\nI Found Myself In Another Room 3:51\nPigeonhole 6:06\nSome vinyl copies of Pigeonhole had a free 7\" with a cover of the Velvet Underground's 'I'm Set Free'\n\nThe Peel Sessions (1991, Strange Fruit Records) cd tracks:\nPurple Haze 1:46\nMan Without Qualities II 3:19\nJaggerbog 3:42\nBig 5:32\nGet Better 3:25\nPart 4 4:29\nMan Without Qualities One 4:44\nBody Exit Mind (1992, Play It Again Sam) UK No. 57 cd tracks:\nBong 4:05\nIt's Not What You Know 4:07\nStockholm 5:12\nI Take You To Sleep 3:52\nBruises 6:58\nHow Much Longer Must We Tolerate Mass Culture? 1:19\nKyphos 4:44\nTeenage Combo 0:25\nBeatlemania 4:50\nWhat Kind Of Hell Is This? 0:39\nAmerican Money 4:28\nMissing Parts Of Famous People 1:05\nPatchwork Lives 5:08\nMusic 8:08\nExit Body, Exit Mind 1:02\nLove It All (1995, Play It Again Sam) (as New FADS) cd tracks:\nThese Foolish Things 4:31\nLife Is An Accident 3:02\nLeft Right 3:59\nEvery Once In a While 4:15\nWhy Waste Your Love 3:35\nMonday It Is 4:15\nSaxophone 3:35\nWhat I Feel 3:52\nPSV 4:15\nKill My Instincts 3:34\nSouvenir 1:54\n\n\n=== Other appearances ===\nVolume Two - Various Artists (Contains unique mix of \"All Over My Face\" (Scam Mix))\n“home” - various artists (Contains Jaggerbog) sheer joy records 1990\nFifteen Minutes: A Tribute to the Velvet Underground (1994, Imaginary Records – ILLCD 047P, includes \"I'm Set Free\" by New F.A.D.S.\nThis Is Fascism (1996, M.C.

    "text": "EMF are an English alternative rock band from Cinderford, Gloucestershire, who came to prominence at the beginning of the 1990s. During their initial eight-year run, from 1989 to 1997, the band released three studio albums before a hiatus. Their first single, \"Unbelievable\", reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart, and was a number 1 hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Their debut album, Schubert Dip, went to number 3 on the UK Albums Chart.\nIn April 2022, EMF released their first album of new material in 27 years, Go Go Sapiens.\n\n\n== Band name ==\nThe name EMF is an initialism of Epsom Mad Funkers, a name taken from a fan club of the band New Order in 1989.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Formation (1989) ===\nAll the members of the band were relatively well known in the Forest of Dean music scene before forming EMF in Cinderford in October 1989. Keyboard and sampler player Derry Brownson had formed a band called Flowerdrum but left to join bass guitarist Zac Foley, drummer Marc Decloedt, DJ Milf, and singer James Atkin as EMF. Ian Dench was the last to join, having already tasted moderate success as a guitarist for Apple Mosaic.\nThe band's music has been classified as indie rock. They toured the UK in 1990 with Stereo MCs.\n\n\n=== Schubert Dip and Stigma (1990–1992) ===\nIn 1990, their debut single \"Unbelievable\" topped the charts in many countries around the world, reaching number 1 in the U.S. in July 1991. The single featured sampled utterances from comedian Andrew Dice Clay. In 1991, EMF released their debut album Schubert Dip which went to number 3 in the UK. The name was explained by songwriter Ian Dench, as \"If ever I'm short of a chord sequence, I nick one from Schubert.\" Successful singles from the album included \"I Believe\", \"Children\", and \"Lies\". \"Lies\" included a voice sample of Mark Chapman, John Lennon's murderer. Yoko Ono, Lennon's wife, achieved an injunction, and a modified version was included in future pressings.\nIn 1992, EMF returned with the Unexplained EP (including a cover version of \"Search and Destroy\") and later Stigma, their second album. Both of these releases did poorly in the charts. The singles released were \"Getting Through\", \"They're Here\", and \"It's You\".\nAlso in 1992, EMF appeared on the Red Hot Organization's dance compilation album Red Hot + Dance, contributing \"Unbelievable (The Hovering Feet Mix)\". The album attempted to raise awareness and money in support of the AIDS epidemic, and all proceeds were donated to AIDS charities.\n\n\n=== Cha Cha Cha and first hiatus (1995–2000) ===\nEMF's third album, Cha Cha Cha, was released in 1995 and featured the singles \"Perfect Day\" and \"Bleeding You Dry\". In the same year, EMF teamed with comedians Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer and recorded \"I'm a Believer\", a cover of The Monkees song. This single reached No. 3 in the UK singles chart.\nFollowing the release of the Afro King single (which failed to do well), the band split up for the first time. However, all members of the band continued to play music. Ian Dench formed the indie rock band Whistler, which was active from 1998 to 2000.  James Atkin formed the big beat trio Cooler and Derry Brownson formed the alternative rock trio LK. Zac Foley became the bass player for Carrie.\n\n\n=== Reunion and second hiatus (2001–2006) ===\nIn 2001, EMF played a reunion gig in London. They also released a greatest hits album: Epsom Mad Funkers: The Best of EMF.\nZac Foley died on 3 January 2002 at the age of 31, due to an overdose of non-prescribed drugs. Following his death, EMF played just four more gigs in late 2002 before splitting again.\n\n\n=== Second reunion and third hiatus (2007–2009) ===\nIn 2007 the band reformed to play a one-off gig at the Scala in King's Cross, London, on 18 December. The place of Foley was taken by Richard March, formerly of Pop Will Eat Itself and Bentley Rhythm Ace.\nIn 2008 EMF played the Portsmouth Festival on 9 October and supported Carter USM at Birmingham Academy and London's Brixton Academy in November that year.\nIn May 2009 EMF announced that due to personal issues, the band would not be doing any more shows in the near future, thus ending their second reunion.\n\n\n=== Third reunion (2012–2019) ===\nIn 2012, they reformed to play at the inaugural festival Lakefest in Tewkesbury, alongside Levellers and Dodgy, on 18 and 19 May. The band welcomed new bassist Stevey Marsh during this show. For the first time, they performed every track from the album Schubert Dip in order to coincide with the 21st anniversary re-release. The band headlined at the Westbury Festival on 25 August 2012. In December 2012 the band played Schubert Dip and Stigma from start to finish at the Gloucester Guildhall. The show was recorded and sold as a live Blu-ray/DVD titled Videodrome: Long Live the New Flesh.\nOn 1 October 2016 the band headlined Indie Daze in London.\n\n\n=== From Us To You and Go Go Sapiens (2020–present) ===\nIn 2020 the band released a career-spanning vinyl box set titled From Us to You. It contained all the full-length albums remastered, and a fourth disc containing unreleased demos and non-album tracks. On 1 April 2022, the band released an all-new material album, titled Go Go Sapiens. Its first single, \"Sister Sandinista\", was released 1 March 2022. They also had a short UK tour in early April 2022.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJames Atkin (vocals, guitars)\nIan Dench (guitars, keyboards)\nStevey Marsh (bass)\nAdrian Todd (drums)\nDerry Brownson (keyboards, samples)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nZac Foley (bass), born 9 December 1970, Gloucester; died 2 January 2002\nDJ Milf (DJ) Original member 1990 Born 1970\nJack Stephens (drums)\nTim Stephens (guitars)\nMark Decloedt (drums)\nRichard March (bass)\n\n\n=== Later work ===\nSince 2010 James Atkin has taught music at Holy Family Catholic School in Keighley, West Yorkshire and is a touring member of Bentley Rhythm Ace.

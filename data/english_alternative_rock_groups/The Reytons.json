    "text": "The Reytons are an English indie rock band from Rotherham.  Band members include frontman Jonny Yerrell, lead guitarist Joe O'Brien, bass player Lee Holland, and drummer Jamie Todd. They formed in 2017, with Sean O'Connor playing drums for their debut show, before subsequently stepping down. They released their debut album, Kids Off the Estate, on 12 November 2021. It debuted at number eleven on the UK Albums Chart. The second album, What's Rock and Roll?, was released on 20 January 2023, achieving top spot.\nOn 27 January 2023, it was announced that their album What's Rock and Roll? had topped the UK Albums Chart, making it the Reytons' first chart-topping album.\nOn 26 January 2024, The Reytons released their third studio album Ballad Of A Bystander. Following a heated chart battle with James Arthur, the album lost out on the number one spot in what was reported to be controversial circumstances when the band were deducted over 2,000 chartable sales 'following an industry complaint'. \nThe Reytons played their biggest show to date on 6th July 2024, with a 20,000 capacity sold-out concert in Rotherham's Clifton Park. Dubbed 'Disneyland' by the band's fans, it is the biggest live music event the town has hosted, and the most notable since T-Rex played the park's bandstand in 1971. A study by Sheffield Hallam University revealed that the event contributed an impressive £1 million to Rotherham’s economy and £1.36 million benefit for South Yorkshire. \nIn September 2024, the band revealed that former England and Manchester United footballer Gary Neville had joined the band in support of an upcoming UK & Ireland headline tour, although this was later revealed to be only part of a promotional campaign for the tour. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n== References =="

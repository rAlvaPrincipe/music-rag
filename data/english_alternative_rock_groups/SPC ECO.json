Crowley commented \"We played them before to always a good reaction; Rose likes twisters and Marcel Duchamp, Dean likes eating biscuits and staying up late.\" A review by Wave Maker Magazine stated \"Push is undeniably one of those songs that automatically has the ability to put you into a trance, and for all of the right reasons.\"\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n3-D (2009; 1 January 2010) \nYou Tell Me (1 November 2011)\nDark Notes (18 August 2012)\nSirens and Satellites (18 September 2013)\nThe Art of Pop (28 June 2014)\nDark Matter (3 May 2015)\nAll We Have Is Now (25 March 2016)\nAnomalies (12 August 2016)\nCalm (22 August 2017)\nFifteen (15 February 2019)\n6月LP (1 June 2020)\n9月ST (1 September 2020)\nDay By Day (18 June 2021)\nTimes Like These (16 July 2021)\nBe The Change (22 July 2022)\nElevated (16 Dec 2022)\nHow Did We Get Here?

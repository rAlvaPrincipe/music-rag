    "text": "The Shrubbies were an English pop group from Wallington, London, active from 1996 to 1998. The band was formed as Shrubby Veronica by Craig Fortnam (vocalist and guitarist), Sharron Saddington (vocalist and bass guitarist) and the former Cardiacs members Sarah Smith (vocals, saxophone, keyboards) and Dominic Luckman (drums). They gigged enthusiastically in London for several years and then split up as Fortnam was disillusioned with playing the traditional indie rock toilet circuit.\nFortnam had a chance meeting with William D. Drake which led to him joining Drake's band, Lake of Puppies, with Saddington. Fortnam and Saddington fell in love, forming the Shrubbies with Smith and Luckman. The band released an eponymous EP, The Shrubbies, in 1997 and an album Memphis in Texas, in 1999, following its dissolution. Fortnam and Saddington later married and recruited musicians associated with Cardiacs to form the North Sea Radio Orchestra.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter playing bass guitar in a jazz fusion band, Craig Fortnam had a chance meeting with the former Cardiacs member William D. Drake, which led to him joining Drake's post-Cardiacs psychedelic pop combo Lake of Puppies with Sharron Saddington. Fortnam fell in love with Saddington, and the couple formed the Shrubbies alongside former Cardiacs members Sarah Smith and Dominic Luckman. The pop group, initially called Shrubby Veronica, originated from Wallington, London in 1996. They gigged enthusiastically in London and beyond, supporting a headlining gig by Huge Baby and playing concerts with like-minded bands the Monsoon Bassoon, Podsdarapomuk and Delicate AWOL.\n\n Though the collaboration was creatively rewarding for Fortnam, he became disillusioned with playing the traditional indie rock toilet circuit. Fortnam was annoyed the poor etiquette and atmosphere he encountered at concerts, so the band dissolved in 1998. Following their dissolution, Fortnam  went to Dartington College to study composition and decided he \"wanted to be Stravinsky\", married Saddington and recruited like-minded musicians associated with Cardiacs and classical connections to form the North Sea Radio Orchestra, with Sharron on lead vocals.\nShrubbies, featuring Dominic Luckman, were set to specially reform for the Alphabet Business Convention at the Salisbury Arts Centre on 26 August 2017, but were replaced by the band Prescott on the revised bill.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Shrubbies' discography was produced by Cardiacs frontman Tim Smith and released though the record label Merlin Audio. The songs were recorded at Apollo 8 in Chessington, Surrey and Purple Studios in Norwich, Norfolk. The music has been described as folk-pronk and folk prog by Misfit City and Ondarock respectively, and their releases have been categorised as acoustic pop, baroque pop, electroacoustic folk, folk baroque, psychedelic folk, psychedelic pop and psychedelic rock. A four-track EP released in 1997 and the album Memphis in Texas in 1999 following the dissolution.\n\n\n=== The Shrubbies EP ===\n\nA self-titled EP featuring a selection of songs from Memphis in Texas was released by Merlin Audio on 20 September 1997, exclusively on CD. Misfit City described the tracks as \"four complex and leaping songs, swinging through an adventure playground of sophisticated eccentric harmony based around Craig’s dextrous gut-strung acoustic guitars and Sharron’s fluffy chirrup\", praising Sarah Smith's saxophone and keyboard riffs.\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\n\n\n==== Personnel ====\nCredits adapted from The Shrubbies EP liner notes.\n\n\n=== Memphis in Texas ===\n\nThe Shubbies' lone album was released on CD by Merlin Audio in 1999.

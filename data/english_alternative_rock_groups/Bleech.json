They were soon noticed by former Food Records boss Andy Ross, and played at his Camden Crawl festival that year.\n\n\n=== Early days (2009–2011) ===\nOne of the first venues the band played was the Ruskin Arms in Manor Park, London.  The pub was renowned as the original rehearsal space for Small Faces and one of the first venues Iron Maiden played.\nWith the release of their first single, \"Is It True That Boys Don't Cry?\", Bleech swiftly gained approval from the music media, including places on the NME '10 Tracks You Have To Hear This Week' list, NME Radio A-list, BBC Radio 6 playlist and Gill Mills' Best of Myspace list.  Their second single, \"The Worthing Song\", was also on the NME Radio A-list and Single of the Month in Clash Magazine.  Clash also featured \"Mondays\" on a free download compilation album of their top tracks of the month.  By the end of 2009, Bleech had supported several top acts, including Wolfmother, The Charlatans, Pete Doherty, The Kooks and The Rifles.\nIn 2011, Bleech became the face of the Kangol Autumn/Winter 2011 campaign, which included a photo shoot with renowned music photographer Janette Beckman and a performance at the Aerial7 launch party in New York.  They also signed a worldwide publishing deal with Bucks Music Group that year and released their first EP, Deadhead.\n\n\n=== Nude (2012–2013) ===\nIn June 2012, Bleech released their first album, Nude.  Days after the launch, they were announced as one of the support acts asked to perform at #ASH20, the 20th birthday celebration of Ash, hosted by Josie Long.  Shortly after #ASH20, rock music magazine Kerrang! featured an article on Bleech.  In August 2012, Bleech played at the Y Not Festival and released their second EP, The Hippie & Me.\nBritish super-middleweight boxer Frank Buglioni appeared in the band's \"Break My Nose\" video in October 2012.  The video was nominated for Best Music Video at the Limelight Film Awards 2013.\nThe Fédération des Radios Associatives Rock, a collection of independent French radio stations, listed Nude at number 15 on their Feraliste (a chart of the albums most played by their member stations) for April 2013.\nTheir second album, Humble Sky, was released on 10 March 2014.\n\n\n== Line-up ==\nJennifer O'Neill – lead vocals, lead guitar\nKatherine O'Neill – bass, backing vocals\nMatt Bick – drums, backing vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nNude (2012)\nHumble Sky (2014)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nDeadhead (2011)\nThe Hippie & Me (2012)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Is It True That Boys Don’t Cry?\" (2009)\n\"The Worthing Song\" (2009)\n\"Mondays\" (2012)\n\"Adrenalin Junkie\" (2012)\n\"Break My Nose\" (2012)\n\"Not Like You\" (2013)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Bandcamp page"

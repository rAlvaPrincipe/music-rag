Nick Sheppard previously played in The Cortinas and The Clash. Gareth Sager previously played in The Pop Group, and in Rip Rig + Panic with Neneh Cherry.\nAlthough they never achieved major sales they are now belatedly acknowledged as a forerunner of today's trip hop scene.\nThe title of the second album is a reference to Tales of Ordinary Madness, a film based on the work of poet Charles Bukowski.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nA Snog on the Rocks (1987)\nTales of Ordinary Madness (1988)\nIntoxicator (1989)\n\n\n== Members ==\nRich \"Clevedon Pier\" Beale - lead vocals\nGareth \"Hank Sinclair\" Sager - guitar, keyboards, most songwriting\nNick \"Chopper Harris\", \"Candy Horsebreath\" Sheppard - guitar\nPaul \"Cheese Jackson\" Francis - bass\nJohn Slight - bass (Virgin Records)\nJamie \"Plastic Bag\" Hill - drums\nMark \"SMT\" Taylor - bass\n\n\n== See also ==\nCulture of Bristol\nList of bands from Bristol\nBristol Sound\n\n\n== References =="

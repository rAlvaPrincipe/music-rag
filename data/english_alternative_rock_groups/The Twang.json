They originally performed in and around Birmingham under the name \"Neon Twang\". During this period, Etheridge and Watkin often swapped instruments. The addition of guitarist Stu Hartland in late 2005 enabled Watkin to take over bass duties permanently and allowed Etheridge to perform live without playing guitar. The name Neon Twang was eventually dropped by the managers of the band, as the name had become notorious for fights at gigs , and a new name was needed to change the image of the band, so they became just 'The Twang'.\n\n\n=== Love It When I Feel Like This (2007–2008) ===\nThe Twang eventually signed to independent record label B-Unique in 2007.

    "text": "The Muffin Men are a British musical group founded in 1990 and based in Liverpool, England, which primarily plays the music of Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention. \nRather than play pieces note-for-note as originally written by Zappa, the band play their own interpretations of Zappa's material. They intend to cater to strengths of the current line-up, often giving the music a different slant from the original versions.\nThe group formed in 1990, originally to play a one-off concert to celebrate Zappa's fiftieth birthday. They are named after Zappa's 1975 song \"Muffin Man\". Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the band toured for thirty unbroken years around the UK, Europe and Scandinavia, performing Zappa's music as a tribute band, along with some of their own compositions. \nUntil his death in 2008, the band often featured guest vocals and percussion Jimmy Carl Black, who performed with Zappa in the Mothers of Invention. With Black, they also performed material by Captain Beefheart.\nIn 1994 The Muffin Men played a nine-week European tour with guest vocalist/guitarist Ike Willis, and again teamed up with Willis in 2003 for a special Zappanale festival show, which also featured Napoleon Murphy Brock.\nMike Keneally has also appeared with the band, along with Ray White and Robert Martin.\nDenny Walley toured and recorded with the band from 2010 to 2018.\nThe band's 25th anniversary gigs (2015) featured a core line-up of three original members – Rhino, Jumpy and Roddie, with Phil Hearn on keys.

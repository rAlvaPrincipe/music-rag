    "text": "Dodgy are an English rock band formed in Hounslow in 1990. The band rose to prominence during the Britpop era of the 1990s. They are best known for their hits \"Staying Out for the Summer\", \"If You're Thinking of Me\", and \"Good Enough\".  \"Good Enough\" was their biggest hit, reaching No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart. They released their latest album, What Are We Fighting For, in September 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and initial activity (1990–97) ===\nThe band was formed by Nigel Clark, Mathew Priest, and Andy Miller. Relocating from Worcestershire to London in 1988, Clark and Priest played together in the trio Purple, with Frederic Colier on the bass. They recruited guitarist Ben Lurie, who left the band after one week to join The Jesus and Mary Chain and was replaced by Miller. After Colier's departure, the band renamed itself Dodgy.\nThe band played an eight-month residency at a wine bar in Kingston Upon Thames and created a following. In 1991, they signed a six-album deal with A&M Records and signed publishing with BMG.\nDodgy's debut album was produced by The Lightning Seeds' Ian Broudie. The band concerned themselves with social issues by supporting The Serious Road Trip, War Child, the Liverpool Dockers' Strike, Charter88 and youth democracy campaigns. The band became the second UK act, after China Drum, to play in Sarajevo after the lifting of the siege, giving a concert at the Kuk club in August 1996. They returned to Bosnia in 1997, to film a programme with Kate Thornton in Mostar.\n\n\n=== Post-break up and reunion (1998–present) ===\nWhile Clark was absent from 1998 to 2007 to pursue ongoing solo projects, Priest and Miller continued the band as a five piece joined by the vocalist David Bassey, keyboardist Chris Hallam, and bassist Nick Abnett. This line-up of the group recorded one album, Real Estate, in 2001. The album was produced and mixed with Robin Evans at T-Pot Studios in Perthshire. In the meantime, Clark released the solo album 21st Century Man in 2006, and in 2007 he teamed up with the dance music duo to record a remix of Dodgy's \"Good Enough\".\nThe band played two sets at Guilfest in July 2008. The first set was an acoustic set in the Unison tent where they appeared in support of the organisation. They later played a set with full band on the main stage. They headlined the Sunday night at Beached Festival in August 2008, and appeared at the ToneFest in September. In November, the first tracks from new recording sessions appeared online. They played a benefit show in May 2009, as part of the homelessness charity Crisis' 'Hidden Gigs' campaign, alongside The Bluetones.\nIn 2009, Dodgy played at Glastonbury Festival, as well as appearances at Bug Jam 2009, Whatfest and Cornbury. On 29 August 2010, Dodgy played at The Galtres Festival in North Yorkshire, playing Dodgy tracks such as \"In a Room\" and \"Staying out for the Summer\", as well as a version of Nigel Clark's solo track, \"21st Century Man\".\nOn 23 April 2011, Dodgy played as the headliners at the Mash Fest Festival in Trowbridge and on 28 May 2011, Dodgy headlined at the LeeStock Music Festival in Sudbury, Suffolk, helping to raise money for the Willow Foundation. Mathew Priest said in an interview with the BBC that they would be playing a mixture of new songs and old favourites and talking of their new material said \"If we can just get people to listen to it, they're going to love it\". on 25 August 2011, Dodgy also Headlined at the Garlic Festival, in the Isle of Wight. For live shows promoting the album, the band recruited Stuart Thoy of the band Smoke Feathers to play bass. In May 2012 they played at Lakefest festival.\n\"What Became of You\" was the first single to be taken from Stand Upright in a Cool Place, their new album.  Rather than following the trend of bands re-forming to play their classic albums in full, Dodgy announced that on their recent UK tour, it was their new album that would be previewed live in its entirety. The album was released 20 February 2012 via the independent Strikeback Records, to favourable reviews from MOJO, the Guardian  and Q Magazine. Thoy would then join the band as a full member and participate in the recording of their fifth album, What Are We Fighting For, which was released on 2 September 2016.\nClark released the solo album Make Believe Love in 2020, and also works as a music teacher at the Aspire Academy in Worcester.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nAllMusic biographer Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the band as \"clowns of Brit-pop\" that played \"infectious, goofy punk-pop\", which \"alternately sounded like the early Who and the Stone Roses.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nSo Far on 3 Wheels – Dodgy on the Radio (2007)\nDodgy – Live at Cornbury Festival (2009)\nDodgy Live – Back to Back (2013)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Downloads ===\n\"Forgive Me – Demo\" (2008)\n\"Down in the Flood\"  (2008)\n\"Find a Place\" – The Bootleg Series and Crisis Charity Download (2009)\n\"Christmas at the Foodbank\" (2013 charity release for The Trussell Trust)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Britpop musicians\nList of NME covers\nList of performers on Top of the Pops\nList of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nDodgy's official website (launched 8 November 2008)\nDodgy's official MySpace\nComprehensive discography\nDodgy on The Mag"

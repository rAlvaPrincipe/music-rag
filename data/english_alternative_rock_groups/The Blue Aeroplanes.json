    "text": "The Blue Aeroplanes are an English rock band from Bristol, the mainstays of which have been Gerard Langley, brother John Langley, and dancer Wojtek Dmochowski. All three had previously been members of the new wave \"art band\" Art Objects from 1978 to 1981.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Blue Aeroplanes first performed under that name at the King Street Art Gallery in Bristol in 1981. They consisted mainly of former members of Art Objects, with the addition of Nick Jacobs, former guitarist and vocalist of Southampton band the Exploding Seagulls. The same line-up played three or four concerts over the next couple of years, either at the gallery or for benefits, including a Karl Marx centenary performance at the Victoria Rooms, with the addition of trumpet and didgeridoo. The Blue Aeroplanes' first album Bop Art was released on their own Party Records in 1984, and was rapidly picked up by the Abstract (US) and Fire (UK) labels. It contained material that had been considered as a follow-up to Art Objects' only album, Bagpipe Music. Gerard Langley's largely spoken poetic lyrics were combined with a heavily guitar-centric band that went on to release Tolerance (1985) and Spitting Out Miracles (1987) and several singles and EPs whose B-sides were brought together in the compilation FriendLoverPlane (1988), all on the Fire label.\nOn 24 February 1990, the band released their most critically acclaimed album, Swagger, this time on a major label Chrysalis/Ensign. This was followed by Beatsongs, which was recorded in the United States and released in 1991. It was produced by Larry Hirsch. This second album on the major label was their highest charting, reaching no. 33 in the UK Albums Chart. A second compilation of rare B-sides and out-takes, FriendLoverPlane2 (Up in a Down World), was released in 1992.\nThe follow-up to Beatsongs was delayed until 1994, when the album Life Model was released on the Beggars Banquet label; it was followed by Rough Music in 1995. \"Broken & Mended\" from Life Model was the band's last single to chart and is a favourite at gigs. A long break and another label change to ArtStar preceded the release of Cavaliers in 2000. Following negotiations with EMI who now owned the rights to Swagger and Beatsongs, The Blue Aeroplanes made a surprise return to this major label. EMI re-released Swagger Deluxe as a 2-CD version in January 2006. This was followed by an album of new material called Altitude later that year, released on EMI's Harvest imprint. The group then recorded an album of cover versions of classic tracks that were originally recorded by artists signed to the Harvest label. The album, called Harvester, was released by EMI/Harvest in 2007.\nAs well as the two FriendLoverPlane compilations, several other compilations have been released in recent years. Huh! The Best of The Blue Aeroplanes (1987–1992) was released by EMI/Chrysalis in 1997 and featured many of the songs from Swagger and Beatsongs. Also in 1997, Warhol's 15 The Best of the Blue Aeroplanes (1985–1988) was released and covered the preceding period when the band was signed to Fire Records. In 1996 Fruit (Live 1983–1995) was released on Fire Records and covered 12 years of live performances recorded at various venues. Then in 2001, ArtStar released Weird Sh*t which featured both rare tracks and alternative versions of some of the band's best-known songs from Swagger through to Cavaliers.\nIn 2008 and 2009, limited-edition live albums were released and sold at the annual Christmas gig at Fiddlers in Bristol. Live in Cheltenham (2008) and Skyscrapers (2009) were limited to just 100 copies each and each featured songs not included on the other live CD. Their Christmas gig moved to The Fleece a few years later and is a staple in their touring calendar.\nThe band released a new album Welcome, Stranger! in January 2017 through Pledgemusic. This was followed up by \"Culture Gun\". Written, and in part recorded, over three years the much delayed - mainly due to vocalist Gerard Langley being hospitalized with cancer - album was released on the 28 April 2023, by Last Night From Glasgow \n\n\n== Live performances ==\n\nThey have played headlining gigs in small indie venues as well as supporting big acts such as R.E.M. and Siouxsie and the Banshees on major international tours, frontman Gerard Langley always wearing his trademark shades even at night in dark venues. Performances include the band's 1992 appearance at Glastonbury which was broadcast on BBC Radio 1, the finale at the Hammersmith Apollo when 12 guitarists were seen on stage performing \"Breaking in My Heart\" and their annual appearance at Fiddlers in Bristol which has now been relocated to the band's own venue, The Fleece.\nIn February 2016 the band played at the 6music festival at Colston Hall's Lantern venue, being introduced by Gideon Coe and in April 2016 they were personally chosen by curator Stewart Lee to play the ATP festival at Pontins Prestatyn.\nIn 2019 the band performed at the Glastonbury Festival on the Avalon Stage.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBop Art (1984), Party\nTolerance (1985), Fire\nSpitting Out Miracles (1987), Fire\nSwagger (1990), Ensign\nBeatsongs, (1991), Ensign\nLife Model (1994), Beggars Banquet\nRough Music (1995), Beggars Banquet\nCavaliers & Roundheads (2000), Swarf Finger\nAltitude (2006), EMI/Harvest\nHarvester (2007), EMI/Harvest\nAnti-Gravity (2011), Art Star/Albino\nWelcome, Stranger!

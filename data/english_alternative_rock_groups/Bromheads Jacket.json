    "text": "Bromheads Jacket (briefly Bromheads) are a three-piece British post punk band originating from Sheffield, England.\n\n\n== History ==\nBromheads formed in Sheffield in 2005, following the split of a band called Fixated. Although often compared to other Sheffield bands who found fame around the same time, such as Arctic Monkeys and Milburn, the band is heavier than others in their scene. Their style also differs due to singer Tim Hampton's southern England accent (he was raised in Yateley, Hampshire).\nThe band released the singles \"Woolley Bridge\", \"What Ifs + Maybes\", \"Trip to the Golden Arches\"', \"Lesley Parlafitt\", and \"Speaker Box\", all released on the Marquis Chacha label. They went on several tours of the UK, and also played across Europe, including in Spain (at the Summercase Festival), Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. In 2005, they joined the nationwide Club NME tour, and played at South By Southwest in Austin, Texas.\nTheir first album, Dits from the Commuter Belt, was released on 13 November 2006, and was followed by a tour of over 30 gigs around the UK supported by the Middlesbrough group The Oxfam Glamour Models. They have also played at the London Calling festival in Amsterdam on three occasions, twice in 2006 and once in 2008.\nIn 2006, the band recorded a cover of The Streets' single \"When You Wasn't Famous\", which was released on the b-side of the song's 7\". The single reached number 8 in the UK charts.\nTheir song \"Fight Music for the Fight\" was featured in the video game Burnout Dominator, as well as its successor Burnout Paradise on PS3 and Xbox 360.\nTheir second album, On The Brain, was released on 22 September 2008.\nIn September 2009, the band released the single \"Boots\" (a cover of \"These Boots Are Made For Walkin'\") as a free download on their official website, but under the name Bromheads, dropping the name word Jacket, as a result of losing the bass player Jono West. Tim Hampton and Dan Potter said they would continue as a two-piece band. It was then confirmed that the band would release a free single every month for a year, finishing in November 2010 with their final free song, \"Chocolate Factory\". In December 2010, they released, as Bromheads, their third album, called The Lamp Sessions, with 10 original tracks from the last 12 months available singles.\nIn late 2012, the band released the EP Holding the Gun and announced that they were working on a new album to be released the following year. Their fourth album, Choro, which contained a new song \"Gonna Let You Melt\", was released on 15 April 2013, available to download at their website.\nIn 2024, Bromheads are back with the Jacket. As written on their new website:\n\"When Bromheads Jacket emerged as a key member of the Sheffield indie scene of the noughties, nobody knew how to pigeon hole them. Lead singer and songwriter Tim Hampton sang, not in with Yorkshire twang but in a thick Surrey accent. His band were heavier than everyone else. “The streets with guitars” was about the best the music press could come up with to describe what was, at that point a new sound.\nFast forward 18 years and a plethora of post punk bands have adopted the sound. Some like the brilliant, Idles have  gone on to enjoy great success in the genre. \nBromheads Jackets meanwhile spectacularly imploded in a haze of glorious self sabotage. Hampton’s honest assessment is that they “fucked it up”. It’s hard to disagree. \nNow, they’re back with a bunch of new material, sounding better than ever to rightfully reclaim their title as forerunners to the modern post punk scene. \nSome bands are incredibly  popular. Others are important and influential. Bromheads Jacket 2.0 might yet be both.\" \n- Jon 'The Reverend' McClure \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nDits from the Commuter Belt (2006)\nOn The Brain (2008)\nThe Lamp Sessions (2010) (as Bromheads)\nChoro (2013) (as Bromheads)\n\n\n=== Extended Plays ===\nLost Fables (2024)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nWoolley Bridge (2006)\nWhat Ifs and Maybes (2006)\nTrip to the Golden Arches (2006)\nLesley Parlafitt (2007)\nSpeaker Box (2008)\nTurn Me On (2008)\nJuiced Up (2024)\n\n\n=== Singles (as Bromheads) ===\nBoots (October 2009)\nHole in the Head (November 2009)\nEdey (December 2009)\nMagic Number (January 2010)\nDedicated (February 2010)\nSnow (March 2010)\nFan of the Vagrants (May 2010)\nBlinkers On (June 2010)\nCinderella's (July 2010)\nFriends (August 2010)\nLeast of Her Worries (September 2010)\nChocolate Factory (November 2010)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSandman interview"

They've released three albums and one compilation. The band's debut album Enjoy It While It Lasts reached number 12 in the UK Albums Chart and went to number one on the Official Record Store Chart on the week of its release.\n\n\n== History ==\nSpector were formed in 2011 by former Les Incompétents and Ox.Eagle.Lion.Man frontman Fred Macpherson, and practiced and performed their first gigs in Efes Snooker Club in East London. Macpherson notes that the band have drawn inspiration from 1980s acts including Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Spandau Ballet and Ultravox.\nIn 2011, Spector were granted a session on BBC Radio 1 DJ Huw Stephens's radio show, and performed on the BBC Introducing stage at the Reading and Leeds Festival. They appeared on the live broadcast of Later... with Jools Holland on 22 November 2011 and performed their single \"What You Wanted\".

Spector also performed their first gig in America at the Coachella Festival in April 2012.\n\n\n=== Enjoy It While It Lasts ===\nAfter releasing new single \"Celestine\" on 20 May 2012, the band revealed that their debut album would be called Enjoy It While It Lasts. The album was released on 13 August 2012 to mixed reviews, reaching number 12 in the UK Album Charts and topping the Official Record Store Chart.\nIn August 2012, the band played at the Reading and Leeds Festival for the second time, this time on the much larger NME/Radio 1 stage. Following the two dates, Spector announced album track \"Friday Night, Don't Ever Let It End\" would be released as a single on Monday 12 November 2012. A music video for the single, directed by Alan Del Rio, was released on 7 October 2012.\nIn October 2012, Spector embarked on promotional tours in Singapore and Malaysia respectively, sponsored by Topman and Universal Music Asia. Following this, the band completed their third UK tour, supported by British indie rock bands Swim Deep, Splashh and LULS.

It was the first song from an EP that was released in January, along with other tracks \"Fine Not Fine\", \"Local International\" and \"Wild Guess\". Describing the track, frontman Fred Macpherson said: \"Untitled in D's been burning a hole in Spector's pocket for a little while now. I wrote the bones of it pretty quickly then Jed came through and channelled the ghost of John Frusciante on guitar and we knew we were on to something. After the sheen of our first two albums it was exciting capturing something simple and irreverent – the sound of us playing in a room rather than playing in a computer\".\nThe EP, titled Ex-Directory, was finally released on 9 March 2018, along with a video for \"Fine Not Fine\" directed by Sarah Pearson and shot in and around Taroudant. Spector announced an accompanying UK tour, with seven dates in May 2018 along with appearances at festivals including Reading and Leeds Festival.

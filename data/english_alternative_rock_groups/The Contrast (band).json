    "text": "The Contrast are a guitar power pop band based in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, in the United Kingdom. They were formed in 1999 by David Reid and have since released five albums on the New York-based label Rainbow Quartz and two for Wicked Cool Records. Since the release of their second album Wireless Days, their music has been regularly played by Little Steven on his Underground Garage radio show. Little Steven once described them on air as \"One of the best bands on the planet – and England too\" and consequently invited them to play the Underground Garage Festival on Randall's Island in 2004. In May 2007, they released a new album called Underground Ghosts (also on Rainbow Quartz) that has since been regularly featured on Little Steven's Underground Garage show. A compilation of tracks from all of the Rainbow Quartz albums was released in 2007. This contains new and unreleased tracks and is the band's first release on Little Steven's \"Wicked Cool\" label. The band's song \"Mystery #1\" was featured on a Wicked Cool compilation album, The Coolest Songs In The World- Vol 2.\nThe Contrast's sixth album (the first full-length album for Wicked Cool Records and featuring Little Steven as executive producer), God of Malfunction, was released on 13 April 2010.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== (2014–present) ===\nThe current line-up consists of:\n\nDavid Reid: vocals/lead guitar\nThorin 'Fozzy' Dixon: drums\nRichard Mackman: bass/vocals\nSimon Russell: keyboards\n\n\n=== Other members ===\nKieran Wade: guitar/vocals\nMatthew Zilch: guitar/vocals (2004–2006)\nAndy Hawkins: drums/keyboards/vocals (2005)\nJames Crossley: drums (1999–2004)\nSpencer Hart: guitar/vocals (2000–2004)\nChris Corney: bass/vocals (1999–2000)\nPaul Blant: drums (1999)\n\n\n=== Collaborators ===\nSpike Smith: drums (2005)\nJo Parsons: drums (2004)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Mystery #1 (Rainbow Quartz, 2000) ====\nPerfect Disguise (3:56)\nShort Term Memory (3:03)\n57 (3:35)\nShe's Been Here Before (2:28)\nYou Never Listen (2:31)\nMystery No. 1 (2:58)\nMad Professor (3:38)\nFalldown (3:39)\nIndependence (4:53)\nTurn Off the Sun (2:47)\nPublicity Stunts (4:19)\nBad Dreams (2:59)\nRemember (3:51)\nFriend for a Day (2:56)\n\n\n==== Wireless Days (Rainbow Quartz, 2002) ====\nCan't Stand the Light (3:12)\nWireless Days (3:05)\nFortune (4:09)\nMask (2:32)\nWhat You Want (3:03)\nAnsaphone (2:47)\nUnfair Game (3:05)\nCharlie Grey (3:20)\nDrop Dead Gorgeous Love Song (4:01)\nLate Train (3:07)\nCover (4:14)\nElvis Fix (5:34)\n\n\n==== Fade Back In (Rainbow Quartz, 2004) ====\nGive Me One More Chance (3:02)\nGeorge Zipp (2:45)\nForget It (3:53)\nThe Guilty Party (3:25)\nCatch the Spark (3:04)\nYour Starring Role (3:40)\nFunctional Punk Pop Song (2:21)\nSomething Tells Me (5:03)\nFlatpacked (2:26)\nSmart (2:35)\nEverything Seems to Get Me (3:22)\nDisconnected (2:33)\n\n\n==== Forget to Tell the Time (Rainbow Quartz, 2005) ====\nCaught in a Trap (2:42)\nForget to Tell the Time (2:47)\nDifferent Again (3:39)\nInk (2:45)\nAdversity (4:08)\nSide FX (2:27)\nMean (3:04)\nSomeone Else's Logo (2:43)\nHold Your Fire (4:12)\nCare (2:22)\nBig Dark Nowhere (3:50)\nTrying to Fill the Space (3:48)\nWhat You Have Done (3:39)\nBe There (4:10)\n\n\n==== Underground Ghosts (Rainbow Quartz, 2007) ====\nEveryone's A Sucker\nMy Peace Of Mind\nI've Known Your Name Forever\nWhat Do I know\nPocketful Of Fear\nClue\nBlast Off In Primetime\nSomething Isn't\nBreaking Promises And Hearts\nShine\nBelieve\nThe World Of Being Wrong\n\n\n==== Perfect Disguise: Introducing the Contrast (Wicked Cool Records, 2007) ====\nMystery #1\nMask\nUnfair Game\nWorld's So Different\nCan't Stand The Light\nCaught In A Trap\nGeorge Zipp\nPerfect Disguise\nPerfect Disguise (Acoustic)\nBelieve\nHow To Tell\nAnsaphone\n57\nBig Dark Nowhere\nDisconnected\nMystery #1 (Acoustic)\n\n\n==== God of Malfunction (Wicked Cool Records, 2010) ====\nUnderground Ghosts\nComing Back to Life\nTake Me Apart\nI Am An Alien\nGone Forever\nGod of Malfunction\nGood Luck Charms\nBetter Than They Seem\nShe's A Disaster\nThought You Were Strong\nUnexpected\nFalse Admission\n\n\n==== A Sinister Flick (Angel Air Records, 2013) ====\nWe Are The Monsters\nBalloon Man\nMr Antenna\nThe Corndog King\nSaving My breath\nHeavens To Murgatroyd\nDays Of Wonder\nDoctor Strange\nJohnny The Torch\nStick Man\nA Sinister Flick\nMr Snake\nGhost Man\nIncredible Girl\nMaze Of Memories\nThere’s Always A Chance\n\n\n==== Madhouse of Inventions (Secret Shark Records, 2018) ====\nBureaucrats\nMadhouse of Inventions\nThe Holy Grail\nYour Secret\nBefore This Caper Goes Down\nThe Vulture Squadron\nWhat Do You Get\nPigless Head\nUpdates\nSinister London\nPassion\nDemons From Your Id\nAtmosphere\nRiver of Infra-Red Light\nIntelligent Life\nThis Final Day\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial home page\nThe Contrast at AllMusic"

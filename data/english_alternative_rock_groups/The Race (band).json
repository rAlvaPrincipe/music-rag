Likened to bands such as U2 and Arcade Fire by music magazines the NME, Drowned In Sound and The Fly. Buchanan's vocals have a strong, Cure-like quality, the band released their first long-playing album in 2006 through Shifty Disco Records (home to Young Knives and [aperlung).  Following the album release, the band toured, including residencies at Club NME, as well as appearances at Truck Festival and Reading Festival.\nIn January 2007, the band recorded a session for Huw Stephens (BBC Radio 1) at the Maida Vale Studios.  The band already had secured radio airplay, having previously performed a session for XFM in June 2005.\nThe band's second album, In My Head It Works, was released in 2009.

They have sold over 1 million albums worldwide.\nThe Wombats released several EPs before working on their first full-length album Girls, Boys and Marsupials (2006), which was released only in Japan and featured some tracks that would reappear on their major-label debut studio album A Guide to Love, Loss & Desperation (2007). After releasing a self-titled EP in 2008 and touring for three years, they released the studio albums This Modern Glitch (2011), Glitterbug (2015), and Beautiful People Will Ruin Your Life (2018), all of which received mostly positive reviews. Their fifth album Fix Yourself, Not the World (2022) became their first No. 1 album, topping the UK Albums Chart within a week of release.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years and debut album (2003–2008) ===\n\nThe trio met as teenagers in 2003 while studying at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts.

Over the course of 2004 to 2005, the band released many EPs such as The Hangover Sessions, No.3, and The Daring Adventures of Sgt. Wimbo and His Pet Otter. Their first official release was Lost in the Post, which was issued as a limited edition 7\" single on 10 July 2006 on the London-based indie label KIDS Records and came with a distinctive additional second sleeve in the form of a FedEx (\"WomEx\") package.

This was followed by the band's first full single after signing to 14th Floor Records, \"Kill the Director\", in late July.

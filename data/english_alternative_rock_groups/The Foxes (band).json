    "text": "The Foxes are an English indie rock band formed in 2006. They have entered the UK Indie Singles Chart twice and have been mentioned in the NME magazine. The band released their début album \"Last Of Many\" in 2011 which was recorded at the Sawmills Studios in Cornwall, produced and mixed by John Cornfield.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the summer of 2006 Nigel Thomas, at the time a mental health professional, and Alex Douglas formed the acoustic duo 'Rush Hour Soul' in London. With the addition of two band members and a name change to \"The Foxes\" the current line-up was formed: Thomas (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Jonathan Bretman (lead guitar), Douglas (bass, backing vocals) and Stephen Wilde (drums). Thomas writes the music and lyrics. \nThe Foxes critically acclaimed début EP 'Lover, Killer' was released in August 2007 and sold in CD format, limited to 500 hand numbered copies.\nIn 2008, the band formed their own record label 'Room 10 Records'. The name originates from the room the band used for rehearsal at Survival Studios in North London.\nThe first release on the new label was the début Single 'Trauma Town' on 20 October 2008, which was sold in limited edition vinyl format and digital download, reaching number 9 on the official UK Indie charts according to the BBC website.\nOn 16 March 2009 the single 'Bill Hicks' (based on famous comedian) was released on CD, vinyl and digital download, which reached number 6 on the official UK Indie charts according to the BBC website. \nOn 3 August 2009 they released a new recording of 'Lover, Killer' as a single on CD, vinyl and digital download, along with a video filmed by Nigel Thomas' brother. This release did not chart as sales were not counted for that period.\nOn 17 May 2010 they released the \"Depression, Joy and a Moment of Fame\" EP, a precursor to their début album. This release also did not chart as sales were not counted for that period.\nThe band are no longer together although singer Nigel Thomas continues to release music. \n\n\n== Present ==\nThe band have worked with John Cornfield (producer and mixer) at Sawmills Studios in Cornwall on their EP 'Depression, Joy and Moment of Fame'.\nTheir début album, 'Last of Many' again produced by John Cornfield at Sawmills, was released on 5 December 2011.\n\n\n== Tours and appearances ==\nThe Foxes have played in various venues across the country and have toured a number of times across the US and UK.

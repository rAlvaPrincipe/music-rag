    "text": "English Teacher are a British music group from Leeds and Lancashire, who formed in 2020. They consist of vocalist Lily Fontaine, guitarist Lewis Whiting, drummer Douglas Frost, and bassist Nicholas Eden. In September 2024, the group were announced as winner of the Mercury Music Prize for their debut studio album This Could Be Texas, released through Island Records.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band met at Leeds Conservatoire. They originally started as a dream pop band called 'Frank' in 2018 before playing their first gig as English Teacher in 2020. Frontwoman Lily Fontaine said of the shift: \"The band that we were before, and the band that we are now, are so different. I think we've benefited from having time to figure ourselves out.\"\nThe band's first single, 2021's \"R&B\", garnered both critical praise and mainstream radio play. The song sees Fontaine consider her place in the white, male world of indie-rock as a mixed race woman. They released the EP Polyawkward in April 2022 through Nice Swan Records. NME called it \" a deliciously sour debut EP, set to a soundtrack of restless art-punk.\" The band appeared on Later... with Jools Holland in November 2023. Their song \"Nearly Daffodils\" was named one of the 10 best songs of 2023 by Time magazine.\nIn January 2024, the band announced their debut album This Could Be Texas, which was released on 12 April through Island Records. The album was well received by critics, winning the 2024 Mercury Prize. 2024 also saw English Teacher named Newcomer of the Year at the Northern Music Awards. \n\n\n=== This Could Be Texas ===\nEnglish Teacher released their debut studio album, This Could Be Texas, on 12 April 2024 through Island Records. The album received widespread critical acclaim. The Line of Best Fit suggested it \"could be one of the finest debuts of the decade, with every band member shining in their ability and craftsmanship.\" It also lauded the band's \"Northern charm\". On 5th September 2024, it was announced that the album won the 2024 Mercury Prize. Judges said their album stood out \"for its originality and character\" and displayed a \"fresh approach to the traditional guitar band format”. English Teacher’s Mercury Prize win ended a nine-year streak of London-based talent winning the award, sparking conversation about the disparity in opportunities for musicians across the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nLily Fontaine – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, synthesizer\nLewis Whiting – lead guitar, synthesizer\nDouglas Frost – drums, piano, synthesizer, backing vocals\nNicholas Eden – bass guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Puressence are a British rock band from Failsworth, Greater Manchester, England, formed in May 1992.\n\n\n== Band membership ==\nThe band, at their break-up, consisted of:\n\nJames Mudriczki: Vocals\nLowell Killen: Guitar\nKevin Matthews: Bass guitar\nTony Szuminski: Drums / percussion\n\n\n== History ==\nJames Mudriczki, Neil McDonald, Anthony Szuminski and Kevin Matthews met on a bus on their way to watch The Stone Roses play at Spike Island.\nThrough much practice their music developed and they decided on the name Puressence, a name instantly identified by most Mancunians for the paper letters 'P'-'U'-'R'-'E'-'S'-'S'-'E'-'N'-'C'-'E', which were plastered around Manchester city centre, on derelict buildings, and on bridges (the most notable being the railway bridge opposite the Haçienda). Manchester independent record label 2 Damn Loud released two singles and there was a further single with Rough Trade Singles Club. The band played a series of gigs at Manchester's In The City festival early in the 1990s.\nThe big breakthrough came a couple of years later, when the band signed to Island Records.\nIn August 2003, after more than ten years with Puressence, guitarist and founder member McDonald left the band and has since gone on to form the band Juno Ashes. He was replaced by Lowell Killen, who is originally from the Isle of Man. He has played in other bands and left Manchester band Dry Riser to join Puressence.\nIn 2004, the band played at The Witchwood in Ashton-under-Lyne.\nIn 2006, the band released a single titled \"Palisades\" on new Manchester label Reaction, followed by an album, Don't Forget To Remember, in September 2007.\nOn 10 and 11 September 2008 Puressence played their first shows in the US. The first was at the Mercury Lounge in New York City. The next night they played the Apple Store in SoHo. The opening song at the Mercury Lounge was \"I Suppose\". They passed out free CD singles of \"Don't Know Any Better\" to many fans around the United States.\nIn October 2010 the band's website announced details of a new album, Solid State Recital, which was released on 21 April 2011.\nOn 27 November 2013, Puressence announced they had split.\nSince the split, James Mudriczki has been working on a solo album whilst contributing vocals to two tracks on The Red-Sided Garter Snakes 2015 album, Endless Sea. In 2015, it was announced that Mudriczki has formed a new band called The Nihilists. The line up includes Mudriczki on vocals, Steven Kelly on guitars and programming and John Patterson who is the drummer and multi instrumentalist.\nOn 20 November 2023, 10 years after their split, the band announced on their Facebook page that their first concert in 11 years will take place in their hometown of Manchester in June 2024.\n\n\n== Early singles (1992–93) ==\nPrior to releasing these albums, Puressence released two singles and an EP. First the double A-side \"Siamese\" / \"Scapa Flow\" was released through Rough Trade. Then followed the EPs Petrol Skin and Offshore, both released through 2 Damn Loud Records.\n\n\"Siamese\" (Rough Trade) June 1992\n\"Siamese\"\n\"Scapa Flow\"\nPetrol Skin EP (2 Damn Loud Records) 6 July 1992\n\"Telekenesis\"\n\"Suck The Knife\"\n\"Polystyrene Snow\"\n\"Petrol Skin\"\nOffshore EP (2 Damn Loud) 19 April 1993\n\"Offshore\"\n\"None Handed (demo)\"\n\"Mist\"\nToby Chalmers of Island Records offered them a recording contract. Support slots to Marion introduced them to new supporters.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Puressence (1996) ===\nIn May 1995, the band released the \"I Suppose\" single on Island without chart success.

Mani, bassist for the Stone Roses and Primal Scream, appeared as record producer on \"Standing in Your Shadow.\"\n\"This Feeling\" proved to be a hit for the band, when it reached number 33 in the UK Singles Chart, helping the band appear on television programmes such as TFI Friday and Soccer AM. BBC Radio 1 DJ Simon Mayo made this his single of the week and it received airplay on numerous radio stations around the UK. The second single \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" fell just short of the Top 40.

Puressence chose to sack their manager and leave Island Records in February 2002.\nPlanet Helpless, due to the ongoing problems with the record company, released only one single. \"Walking Dead\" gave the band its third Top 40 hit. The video included Mani and Bez (Happy Mondays).\n\n\n=== Don't Forget to Remember (2007) ===\nPuressence's fourth album, entitled Don't Forget To Remember, was recorded at Revolution studios in Manchester and produced by Andy Macpherson. \n\nThe album was released on 24 September 2007.

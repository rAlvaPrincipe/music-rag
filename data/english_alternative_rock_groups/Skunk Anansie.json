    "text": "Skunk Anansie are a British rock band whose members include Skin (lead vocals, guitar), Cass (bass, guitar, backing vocals), Ace (guitar, backing vocals) and Mark Richardson (drums and percussion).\nSkunk Anansie formed in 1994, disbanded in 2001 and reformed in 2009. The name \"Skunk Anansie\" is taken from Akan folk tales of Anansi the spider-man of Ghana, with \"Skunk\" added to \"make the name nastier\".\nThey have released six studio albums: Paranoid & Sunburnt (1995), Stoosh (1996), Post Orgasmic Chill (1999), Wonderlustre (2010), Black Traffic (2012) and Anarchytecture (2016); one compilation album, Smashes and Trashes (2009); and several hit singles, including \"Charity\", \"Hedonism\", \"Selling Jesus\" and \"Weak\".\nThey are often grouped as part of the Britrock movement, as opposed to the contemporary Britpop of their early years due to their overall harder sound. The band, in 2004, was named as one of the most successful UK chart acts between 1952 and 2003 by the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, with a total of 142 weeks on both the singles and album charts ranking them at No. 491. Skunk Anansie have sold 5 million records.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early career: 1994–2001 ===\nThe group played its first gig at London's Splash club in March 1994. In 1995 they were voted Best New British Band by the readers of Kerrang! magazine. At the award ceremony that year drummer Mark Richardson met the band who were looking for a permanent replacement for Robbie France, so an audition was set up and the band was reformed. Soon after that, two of their songs, \"Feed\" and \"Selling Jesus\", appeared on the soundtrack of the film Strange Days in 1995. \"Selling Jesus\" became Skunk Anansie's controversial second song to receive radio play, following their first radio release \"Little Baby Swastikkka\". After hearing this song, radio personality Howard Stern claimed that the band would become a huge hit. Success continued for the band and they were also voted Kerrang!'s Best British Live Act in 1996. In 1997 they were nominated for Best Live Act and Best Group at the MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\nThe group played its first gig at London's Splash club in March 1994, subsequently taking six weeks to record its debut album, Paranoid & Sunburnt, with producer Sylvia Massy at a \"haunted house\" outside the city.

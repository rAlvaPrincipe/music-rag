In 2004 they toured as part of Wichita's 'The Music Machines' touring package along with Bravecaptain and Her Space Holiday. Second album Drunk on Light was released in 2004, prompting comparisons with The Postal Service, Four Tet, and Aphex Twin. Les Inrockuptibles described the album as having elements of shoegazing and \"cut and paste electronica\". \"Halfsmile\" was released as a single in June 2004.\nPortions of \"Bytecry\" from the album Drunk On Light were used for the Mac OS X Tiger intro video, which usually plays on the first bootup of any Mac installed with Mac OS X 10.4.  \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nWeevil (2001), Where It's At Is Where You Are\nDrunk On Light (2004), Wichita\nUnreleased (2007), Orphan\n\n\n=== Singles, EPs ===\nFragile EP (2001), Orphan\n\"Half-Smile\"/\"Lapsed\" Single (2004), Wichita\nNo-Harm EP (2004), Wichita\n\n\n== References =="

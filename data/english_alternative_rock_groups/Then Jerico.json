    "text": "Then Jerico are an English rock band. They scored four top 40 hits in the UK during the 1980s.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe band's early line-up included singer Mark Shaw, bassist Jasper Stainthorpe, drummer Steve Wren, and guitarist Scott Taylor.\nThe band played at The Limelight Club in New York in 1983 and signed to London Records in 1984. The single \"The Big Sweep\" was recorded for London but they objected to the lyrical subject matter (an anti-Robert Maxwell/Rupert Murdoch statement). It was initially released by the track's producer Martin Rushent on his own Immaculate label in 1985 and later as a limited edition by London Records along with the new song \"Fault\".\nThe band's songs \"Muscle Deep\" and \"The Motive\" charted in 1987. They enjoyed success with two albums, First (The Sound of Music) (1987) co-produced by Shaw and Owen Davies, which reached number 35 in the UK Albums Chart, followed by The Big Area in 1989 that went gold and reached number 4 in the UK Albums Chart. Rick Nowels produced several tracks on the album - this led to the appearance of Belinda Carlisle on background vocals on \"What Does It Take\", released as the second single. \nReleased in 1988, ahead of the group's second album, \"Big Area\" achieved their greatest chart success, peaking at number 13 in the UK Singles Chart.\nThe original Then Jerico line-up split up in early 1990, with Mark Shaw leaving the band to pursue a solo career. He released his only studio album, Almost, for EMI in 1991. It was produced by guitarist Andy Taylor and included two singles, \"Love So Bright\" and \"Under Your Spell\". Shaw performed a few small club gigs in 1993 with Taylor under the name \"Then Jerico 2\".\nIn 1998, Shaw re-activated Then Jerico, writing the material for Orgasmaphobia, a self-financed album released on Eagle Rock. The album was co-produced by Mark Shaw and Andy Taylor with collaborations from Taylor, Simple Minds' keyboard player Mick MacNeil and author Iain Banks. In 2000, a live album, Alive & Exposed, was released by Yeaah! Records credited to 'Then Jerico... Mark Shaw Etc.'. It was a recording made in the summer of 1992 of a concert at the Grand Theatre, Clapham in London. It contained a new song, \"Step into the Light\".\nShaw embarked on a new Then Jerico tour in 2012 with an original line-up of the band, made up of Mark Shaw, guitarists Rob Downes and Scott Taylor, bass player Jasper Stainthorpe and drummer Steve Wren.\nA 'Reprise Tour' was launched for 2013 to promote the release of the Reprise compilation album on Warner / Rhino Music with a number of appearances including at Henley's Rewind the 80s Music and at the Let's Rock Bristol festivals.\nIn February 2014, the 'original' Then Jerico discontinued; however, lead singer Mark Shaw continued, as he vowed to do, with a new line-up to fulfill Let's Rock festival dates in May, June and July that year. In 2015, Shaw played club shows prior to a performance at \"Let's Rock London\", on Clapham Common, London, on 16 July 2016. Mark Shaw has also worked intermittently with singer Tony Hadley and the SAS Band.\nOn 27 April 2020, guitarist Scott Taylor died at the age of 58 from a brain tumour.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nMark Shaw (born Mark Robert Tiplady, 10 June 1961, Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England) – vocals (1983–1990, 1998–present)\nRyan Williams – guitar\nMagnus Box – bass\nPaul Davis – drums\n\n\n=== Former ===\nJasper Stainthorpe (born 18 February 1958, Tonbridge, Kent, England) – bass (1983–1989 / 2012–2013)\nSteve Wren (born 26 October 1962, Lambeth, London, England) – drums (1983–1989 / 2012–?)\nScott Taylor (31 December 1961, Redhill, Surrey, England – 27 April 2020) – guitar (1984–1989 / 2012–2020)\nCliff Lawrence – guitar (1983)\nMark Sanderson (born 1961) – keyboards (1983)\nBen Angwin – keyboards (1984–1985)\nAlex Mungo – keyboards (1985–1988)\nRob Downes (born 7 December 1961, Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire, England) – guitar (1987–1989 / 2012–?)\nChris Youdell – keyboards (1988–1989)\nKeith Airey (replaced Scott Taylor on guitar for the Big Area tour in 1989)\nJustin McConville (2010s shows)\nJohn Miller (2010s shows)\nPaul Davis (2010s shows)\nPJ Phillips – bass/backing vocals (1998–2016)\nTheir live shows featured the talents of backing vocalist Bari Goddard (who also worked with Cliff Richard, Madonna and Jimmy Somerville among others) and Steve Lee (Joan Armatrading); some of these performances are available on the double CD release Radio Jerico which showcase some Radio 1 sessions and the full Hammersmith Odeon show of 1989.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThen Jerico official website\nThen Jerico discography at Discogs"

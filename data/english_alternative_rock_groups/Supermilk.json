    "text": "Supermilk is an indie rock band and music project from London, England. Originally the solo recording endeavour of Jake Popyura, Supermilk has been releasing music since 2017 with a full band incarnation active since 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\nSupermilk released its first EP Hello? Yes this is Supermilk... in 2017 via Keroleen Records. A second EP, Rare Delusions, followed in 2019.\nShortly after the dissolution of Popyura's band Doe, Supermilk announced the release of its debut album.  Several live shows were scheduled but later cancelled due to the global coronavirus pandemic. Death Is the Best Thing for You Now was released on 27 March 2020.\nUnable to perform live due to the UK's COVID-19 restrictions, Popyura spent much of 2020 writing the project's second full-length album. Recorded in December the same year with producer Rich Mandell of Me Rex, Four by Three was released via Specialist Subject Records on 2 July 2021. The album was placed at number 2 in Good Morning America's 50 Best Albums of 2021.\nSupermilk started performing live in 2022, with Popyura joined by Sophie MacKenzie (Cheerbleederz), Em Foster (Nervus) and Jay Cavalier (Personal Best). A live album, Live from Rad Apples, was released on 15 July 2022 via Specialist Subject Records.\nThe band released the double single Jessica's Army/Ribcage in May 2023—the first Supermilk release to feature musicians other than Popyura—and were support for the UK leg of Algernon Cadwallader's European tour in June. MacKenzie left the group in November, with Charlie Jamison joining on guitar.\nIn January 2024 Popyura disclosed his diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a rare and terminal neurodegenerative disorder, via the band's Instagram account. Following shows with Speedy Ortiz and Cheekface, Supermilk announced the project's third LP, High Precision Ghosts, and shared the album's lead single Sweat.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nJake Popyura – vocals, bass (2017–present), guitars, drums, synthesiser (2017–2022)\nEm Foster – guitars, vocals (2022–present)\nCharlie Jamison – guitars (2023–present)\nJason Cavalier – drums (2022–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nSophie MacKenzie – guitars, vocals (2022–2023)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nDeath Is the Best Thing for You Now, LP (2020) Keroleen Records\nFour by Three, LP/VHS (2021) Specialist Subject Records\nHigh Precision Ghosts, LP (2024) Specialist Subject Records\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nLive from Rad Apples, cassette (2022) Specialist Subject Records\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nHello?

    "text": "The Rose of Avalanche is an English alternative rock band from Leeds, West Yorkshire, formed in 1984. They have released ten albums.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed by Phil Morris, Paul James Berry and Alan Davis. The name came from the \"rose\" for the beauty and the \"avalanche\" for the power, as a way of describing their music.\nBefore they had played a gig they signed to local independent label LiL, and released two singles: \"LA Rain\" and \"Goddess\". Both made the Top 20 of the UK Independent Chart, with \"LA Rain\" also featuring in John Peel's Festive Fifty in 1985.\nAfter this initial success, Fire Records signed the band and the personnel changed. The lineup became Phil Morris, Paul James Berry, Glenn Schultz, Nicol McKay, and Mark Thompson. Mass market exposure came with the support slot on The Mission's 1986–87 World Crusade Tour. This lineup released a further five singles and the first official studio album – Never Another Sunset in 1989.\nShultz and McKay left the band in 1989, and new bass player Darren Horner was recruited to replace McKay. This lineup released one EP \"A Peace Inside\". Further personnel changes occurred in 1990 with Thompson leaving to be replaced by Andy Porter. The final lineup then delivered one EP and two albums, String A Beads in 1990, and ICE in 1991. Before permanently breaking up, the band played live once more in 1993. The lineup consisted of Morris, Horner, and Schultz, and a drum machine.\nIn 2019, they announced that the band would reform.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nRose of Avalanche (1985), Contempo\nFirst Avalanche (1986), Leeds Independent Label - UK Indie No. 3\nAlways There (1987), Fire\nIn Rock (1988), Fire - UK Indie No. 10\nAnthology (1988), Fire\nLive at Town and Country (1988), Contempo\nNever Another Sunset (1989), Avalantic - UK Indie No. 10\nString 'a' Beads (1990), Avalantic\nI.C.E.

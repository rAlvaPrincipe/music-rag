    "text": "Bradbray Apartment is an English band originally formed in Stafford, England, in 1987.\nAlso known by their fans as \"The Brads\", the band are known for their unique mix of post-punk power along with vintage synths with big catchy choruses and a steady thumping rhythm section. Having separated in late 1989, the band reformed in the summer of 2014 after a local newspaper ran a 25th anniversary piece on their 1989 gig at Covent Garden in London. This prompted the lead singer to get in touch with his old bandmates which led to the reformation.\n\n\n== Band lineup ==\nOriginal band lineup in 1987:\n\nMatt Collins, vocals\nJim Allen, keyboards\nBill Scroggs, bass\nScott Sinfield, guitar\n\n\n=== 1988 ===\nScott Sinfield, guitar, left the band due to other commitments; replaced by\nSteve Follows\n\n\n=== 1989 ===\nMark Gear\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\nMark Gear, drums, left the band due to other commitments; replaced by\nRob Wild\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\nRob Wild, drums; left band late 2017, replaced by\nLiam Collins\n\n\n== Recordings and track releases ==\nWho Needs Einstein EP (Tubecroft Records) September 1989\n\"Reach for the Sky\"\n\"Running\"\n\"Shadowfall\"\n\"Hollow of the Mind\"\nrecorded at The Cottage recording studio Macclesfield\n\nTheory of Relativity EP (Own Label) April 2016\n\"Another You\"\n\"Endgame\"\n\"Don't Wanna Lose You\"\n\"Into the Cold\"\nrecorded at Prism recording studio Stoke-on-Trent\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

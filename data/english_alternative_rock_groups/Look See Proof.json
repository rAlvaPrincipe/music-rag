    "text": "Look See Proof were a five-piece indie pop-rock band from Hertfordshire.\nFounded in 2006, Look See Proof played in venues across the UK supporting bands like The Fratellis, The Rifles, Foals, The Dykeenies, Breaks Co-Op, Good Shoes, The Twang, and The Holloways.\nHigh-profile appearances include playing Club NME at KOKO, Glastonbury Festival, Camden Crawl, The Great Escape Festival and Guilfest.\nThe band released two singles on Tigertrap Records ('Tell Me Tell Me Tell Me'/'Start Again' and 'Discussions'/'Singles The New Together') and were asked to perform live for Steve Lamacq's show on Radio 1 at Maida Vale. First single 'Tell Me Tell Me Tell Me' was awarded \"single of the week\" on Steve Lamacq's BBC6 Music show and sold out within a week of its release date. The two singles were also played by Fearne Cotton, John Kennedy, Marc Riley, and Chris Moyles.\nThird single 'Casualty' was released on Weekender Records, and won Rebel Playlist on Steve Lamacq's show and received a warm reception from NME, with the video directed by Barry Sells (brother of David and Lee) receiving airtime on MTV2.\nThe fourth single 'Local Hero' was released on Weekender Records, to whom Look See Proof had been signed. The video received air time on MTV2.\nThe band also played \"Casualty\" on Lily Allen's talk show, Lily Allen and Friends, after being voted to play by viewers.\nHaving parted ways with Weekender, Look See Proof finished the year with a successful European tour and returned to the studio to begin demoing for a second album. In the second half of 2008 they enlisted guitar tech Jaime Randall to play tambourine and keyboards.\nOn 31 July 2009, they played their last gig in Hitchin, Hertfordshire before splitting.\nSince splitting, former members and brothers Lee Sells and David Sells have formed a new band called Burial Club which includes 2 new members.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nLocal Hero - CD\n1.

    "text": "Dead Orchards are an English indie rock band formed in London, England in 2016. The band consists of multi-instrumentalist Simon Adams and vocalist-guitarist Bobby Faghihi who met at university. The band have released 3 full albums, 2020's \"Sins In Lo-Fi\", 2023's \"I Sometimes Wonder Where You Are Now\" and 2024's \"No Longer Will We Dream\". The band have also released 3 EPs, 2021's \"Postpone Everything From Now On\", 2022's \"Months Tied Unremembering\" and 2023's \"Try\".\nAfter originally starting as a lo-fi acoustic outfit in 2016, the band changed direction in the early 2020s, moving towards a more electronic, synth-driven sound, with their latest album \"No Longer Will We Dream\" drawing on a wide range of influences and instruments. On reviewing their 2024 album, RGM described the record as \"a refreshing mix of acoustic roots and electronic ambition that makes it feel like Dead Orchards are paving a unique path forward.\" Rats on the Run said the album contains \"the very purest form of post punk\".\nDead Orchards have played a number of London venues such as The Water Rats, Hope and Anchor, Half Moon and 229.\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Delta Sleep are a British math rock band, formed in 2010 in Canterbury. They are currently based in Brighton and consist of Devin Yüceil on guitar and vocals, Glen Hodgson on guitar, Dave Jackson on bass and Blake Mostyn on drums. They have so far released 4 EPs and 5 albums.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years, Management, and Twin Galaxies (2010-2017) ===\nDelta Sleep emerged from a band called Sávlön, featuring bass player Maria Sullivan and drummer Adam Brodigan beside Yüceil and Hodgson. They released a self-titled EP in 2010, followed by Management in 2013. Shortly after the release of Management, Sullivan and Brodigan left the band to start a family and focus on other musical projects, respectively. They were replaced by Dave Jackson and Blake Mostyn respectively, both friends of the band. Delta Sleep released their first full-length album Twin Galaxies in January 2015.\n\n\n=== Ghost City, Younger Years and Soft Sounds (2018-2021) ===\nTheir second full-length album, Ghost City, was released in August 2018 to critical acclaim. Ghost City was promoted with tours in Europe, North America and East Asia. During touring for Ghost City, Delta Sleep released their EP Younger Years as a surprise in September 2019.\nFollowing cancelled tour dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Delta Sleep gradually released their compilation album Soft Sounds between May and July 2020. Soft Sounds consists of 9 stripped-down and acoustic live performances that were recorded during touring in France, Japan, the United States and Turkey as well as a new song \"A Casa\", which was later featured on their 2024 album Blue Garden.\n\n\n=== Departure from Big Scary Monsters, Spring Island, and Blue Garden (2021-present) ===\nIn March 2021, Delta Sleep left Big Scary Monsters and started their own independent record label called Sofa Boy Records which is named after their song 'Sofa Boy' from The Younger Years EP. On June 9th, 2021, Delta Sleep released the single 'The Detail' and announced their third album, Spring Island which was planned for release on September 10th, 2021. On August 15th, 2021, Delta Sleep announced that Spring Island was delayed to November 12th, 2021 due to delayed vinyl manufacturing caused by Brexit and COVID-19. On May 7th, 2024, Delta Sleep signed with Wax Bodega in the United States. On August 7th, 2024, Delta Sleep announced their fifth album Blue Garden, consisting of the singles 'Sunchaser', 'Figure in the Dark' and 'Glow' as well as including the studio recording of 'A Casa' from the Soft Sounds compilation album in the tracklist.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nBoth Twin Galaxies and Ghost City are concept albums that follow a protagonist overcoming hardship. Twin Galaxies follows a man whose life was uprooted by a flood on his way to find new hope. In Ghost City, a woman escapes from a dystopian, oppressive city to find a better life more in connection with nature. In contrast, Younger Years was written without an overarching concept in mind.\nDelta Sleep's musical style has been described as math rock and indie rock. Many songs feature odd time signatures and are structured unconventionally.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nTwin Galaxies (Big Scary Monsters, 2015)\nGhost City (Big Scary Monsters, 2018)\nSoft Sounds (Big Scary Monsters, 2020)\nSpring Island (Sofa Boy, 2021)\nBlue Garden (Sofa Boy and Wax Bodega, 2024)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nDelta Sleep (self-released, 2010)\nManagement (Big Scary Monsters, 2013)\nGhost City Rarities (Big Scary Monsters, 2019)\nYounger Years (Big Scary Monsters, 2019)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nCamp Adventure (Full Band Single + Remix) (Big Scary Monsters, 2015)\nThe Detail (Sofa Boy, 2021)\nView to a Fill (Sofa Boy, 2021)\nForest Fire (Sofa Boy, 2021)\nOld Soul (Sofa Boy, 2021)\nAfterimage (Sofa Boy, 2022)\nRe:Forest (Sofa Boy, 2023)\nSunchaser (Sofa Boy, 2024)\nFigure in the Dark (Sofa Boy, 2024)\nGlow (Sofa Boy, 2024)\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nDevin Yüceil – guitar, lead vocals (2010–present)\nGlen Hodgson – guitar, backing vocals (2010–present)\nDave Jackson – bass, backing vocals (2013–present)\nBlake Mostyn – drums, backing vocals (2013–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nMaria Sullivan – bass (2010–2013)\nAdam Brodigan – drums (2010–2013)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDelta Sleep discography at Discogs"

    "text": "Poppy Factory were an English indie rock band from Bradford, England, signed to Chrysalis Records. They released one EP and three singles.  Their debut, the Fabulous Beast EP, met critical acclaim and was played by a number of radio DJs and stations (it was notably thrashed by Rock FM's Tim Lancaster), though its chart performance did not match industry reception. Next came the 7-inch \"Stars\", and then \"7x7\" (composers Cotton/Dale/MacDonald), produced by David Creffield.\nAn album entitled Good Time, which was promoted as 'forthcoming' on the rear sleeve of \"Stars\" never saw the light of day and the band's contract with Chrysalis foundered. They self-released a 12-inch promo, \"Drug House\" before fading into obscurity.\nThe band's frontman Mickey Dale later rose to fame as the keyboard player for Embrace.\n\n\n== References =="

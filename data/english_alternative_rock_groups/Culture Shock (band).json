    "text": "Culture Shock are an English ska punk band formed in Warminster, Wiltshire in 1986 by Dick Lucas, previously of the Subhumans.\n\n\n== Band history ==\nCulture Shock have played hundreds of gigs, including frequent appearances at free festivals, and released six studio albums on the Bluurg record label. Lucas' lyrics were mostly concerned with social and political issues, from cruelty to animals, Northern Ireland, war, and social alienation, but were far from angry rants, often finding a positive and empowering perspective. \nCulture Shock split at the end of 1989, as Bill and Nige both had young families to support. Dick went on to form Citizen Fish with Jasper, the bassist on Culture Shock's final album, and two other former members of the Subhumans. Nige died in 1993.\n\n\n== Reformation ==\nInterest in the band was revived by the release of the Everything CD retrospective in 2012; Culture Shock reformed as a gigging band and have been playing since 2013. The line-up remains the same except with Alex (from Citizen Fish) on guitar.  \n\n\n== Members ==\nDick Lucas – vocals\nBill – drums\nJasper Pattison – bass guitar\nAlex Gordon – guitar\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nPaul Taylor – bass guitar on Go Wild and Onwards & Upwards\nNigel Johnston – guitar, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nGo Wild (1986), Fish 18\nOnwards & Upwards (1988), Fish 20\nAll the Time!

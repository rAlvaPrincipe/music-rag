    "text": "Toploader are an English rock band from Eastbourne, East Sussex, formed in 1997, with over two million album sales and several top-20 hits both home and abroad. Their debut album, Onka's Big Moka, sold over one million units and peaked in the top five of the UK Albums Chart, where it remained for six months; it earned them four nominations at the 2001 Brit Awards. They are best known for their 2000 cover of King Harvest's US hit \"Dancing in the Moonlight\", which became a global hit for them. Their second album, Magic Hotel, reached No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart. The band broke up in 2003, after the release of their second album, but they reformed in 2009 and remain active as of 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings (1997–1998) ===\n\nNamed after a joint-rolling technique, Toploader's career began playing with Coldplay and Muse in small venues across the UK. They later went on to support the likes of Paul Weller, Noel Gallagher, Tom Jones, Robbie Williams, and Simple Minds. On 20 July 2000, they backed Bon Jovi at the original Wembley Stadium, becoming the last British band to play there before it was demolished and redeveloped.\n\n\n=== Commercial success (1999–2001) ===\n\nBy 1998, Toploader had been picked up by S2 Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music, and signed a six-album deal. On 7 May 1999, the band made their first live TV performance on TFI Friday, hosted by Chris Evans. Later that same year, their debut album, Onka's Big Moka, was released on 11 November and became a huge hit. It was produced by Dave Eringa, a longtime collaborator of the Manic Street Preachers. It debuted at number five in the UK Albums Chart and settled at number four. \"Dancing in the Moonlight\" was the top single off the album, eventually reaching number seven in the UK Singles Chart, while \"Achilles Heel\" managed to get to number eight. The band received four nominations at the Brit Awards, though did not win any of them. On 24 June 2000, Toploader played at the Glastonbury Festival, as part of the Saturday lineup.\n\n\n=== Breakup (2002–2003) ===\nIn 2002, the band released a second album, Magic Hotel. It was poorly received by critics and failed to match the success of the first. They struggled with a backlash from the UK music press, and their single \"Time of My Life\" could only make it into the top 20. Due to the negative reception and the album not meeting the same success as the first, the band was dropped by S2. Not long after that, they broke up, in 2003. Julian Deane retired as a musician and in 2007 founded Raygun Music, a Brighton-based management company that serves both as a record label and publisher.\n\n\n=== Reforming and later work (2009–present) ===\n\nIn 2009, Toploader got back together in a lineup that consisted of three of its five original members: Joseph Washbourn, Dan Hipgrave, and Rob Green, with touring and session member Patrick Greenberg (a former touring-bassist with Clean Bandit). They signed a one-record deal with Underdogs Music and released Only Human in June 2011. The first single, \"Never Stop Wondering\", came out on 14 March 2011. Another single, \"A Balance to All Things\" (featuring a remix from Ash Howes), followed on 20 June 2011.\nIn May 2012, Toploader played at Lakefest festival, and in July, they appeared at the Tiree Music Festival in Scotland. During 2012, the band agreed to act as patrons for a UK-based children's charity called Time Is Precious.\nIn 2013, Toploader released a new single, \"Turn It Around\", co-written with Eg White, as part of a four-song EP of the same name. In 2013, they headlined the LeeStock Music Festival in Suffolk and the AmpRocks Festival in Bedfordshire.\nOn 12 May 2017, the band released their fourth album, Seeing Stars; \"Roll with the Punches\" was chosen as its lead single. The record was crowdfunded using an online direct-to-fan music platform called PledgeMusic.\nToploader appeared on Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway on 18 March 2023 as part of the \"Sing-a-long Live\" segment, where they performed \"Dancing in the Moonlight\". They also performed at the 2023 Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 3 October 2023 and the 2023 Labour Party Conference in Liverpool on 11 October.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent\n\nJoseph Washbourn – lead vocals, keyboards, organ, piano, acoustic guitar (1997–2003, 2009–present)\nDan Hipgrave – lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals (1997–2003, 2009–present)\nRob Green – drums, percussion (1997–2003, 2009–present)\nPast\n\nMatt Knight – bass, backing vocals (1997–2003, 2009–2016)\nJulian Deane – rhythm and lead guitars, backing vocals (1997–2003)\nTouring and session members\n\nPatrick Greenberg – bass, backing vocals (2016–present)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nBrit Awards\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nToploader at AllMusic"

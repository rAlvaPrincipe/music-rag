    "text": "Satoshi Ohno (大野 智, Ōno Satoshi, born November 26, 1980) is a Japanese idol, singer, actor, radio host, artist, dancer, and choreographer. He is the lead vocalist and leader of the boy band Arashi, hence his nickname Leader (リーダー, Rīdā).\nOhno began his career in the entertainment industry when he joined the Japanese talent agency Johnny & Associates in 1994 at the age of 13. He started an acting career in 1997 when he was cast to be part of the stage play Kyo to Kyo. In 2008, Ohno became the first and the only artist from Johnny's to hold his own art exhibition, titled \"Freestyle\", and also received his first starring role in a Japanese television drama, Maō, for which he earned a handful of Best Actor awards. Since then, he has continued to star in numerous dramas and movies, receiving a number of awards and nominations for his roles. For his work as an artist, a singer, and an actor in Kaibutsu-kun the Movie, Ohno became one of the recipients of GQ Japan's Men of the Year Award in 2011.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nOhno was born in Mitaka, Tokyo as the youngest child of his family. He has one older sister. During middle school, his mother sent in his application to Johnny & Associates without his knowledge. An invitation to audition was sent back to Ohno, and he subsequently became a trainee in October 1994. To focus on the stage play Kyo to Kyo, which ran from 1997 to 1998 during his trainee days, he withdrew from high school and moved to Kyoto.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFollowing Arashi's hiatus, Ohno had been absent from the public eye, except for a minimum of messages transmitted via the other members. In late April 2024, he provided an interview to a Post Seven reporter, in which he talked about meeting with the others at late night to talk, given the other's busy schedules. Among the things he talked about was Arashi's newly opened company and Ninomiya's independence from Smile-Up. He barely spoke about the hiatus and totally evaded the question of his commercial businesses opening around Miyakojima, Okinawa, including a hotel and a bar. Ohno has been investing in real estate since 2017, with plans to build a tourist resort. Of these, he said \"I don't want to talk about it because it's private\". He also talked about learning to drive. He said that it wasn't because of his needing to drive to Miyakojima, but because he felt it was time he learned, since, before, he had to rely on others to take him wherever he needed to go. About the return of activities as Arashi, Ohno said that nothing has been decided yet, not even a return concert that was rumored to be held in Spring next year.\n\n\n=== Music career ===\n\nBefore his music debut with Arashi, Ohno wanted to resign from Johnny & Associates. However, then-president Johnny Kitagawa asked him to help out with a song recording and to pack up for a trip to Hawaii, which turned out to be the place where the press conference announcing the formation of Arashi was held. With Ohno at the age of 18 at the time, Arashi was officially formed on September 15, 1999 and made their CD debut on November 3, 1999. Since much of his trainee days were spent in Kyoto, he was the least known member during Arashi's early days.\nOhno is the lead vocalist of Arashi. Although his music career is primarily with Arashi, he had a solo concert called 3104 (which can be read as his name Satoshi in Japanese) in 2006 and in 2009, became the first and only member in Arashi to release a solo single. It was a soundtrack for his drama Uta no Onii-san titled \"Kumorinochi, Kaisei\" (曇りのち、快晴) by Yano Kenta starring Satoshi Ohno. Ohno also provided the vocals to the insert song \"Yukai Tsukai Kaibutsu-kun\" (ユカイツーカイ怪物くん), which was released as a single on July 7, 2010 for the drama Kaibutsu-kun and sold around 59,000 copies on the first day.\n\n\n==== Choreography ====\nOhno began his work as a choreographer in 2004 for his solo \"Top Secret\" during Arashi's 2004 Iza, Now Tour and in 2006, began to work as a choreographer for the group. Since then, he has choreographed numerous solo and group dances. Some of his notable choreography work for Arashi includes \"Zero-G\", the live performance for \"Bittersweet\", the interlude for the \"Kokoro no Sora\" music video, \"Tsunagu\", and \"Do You...?\".\n\n\n=== Acting career ===\n\n\n==== Stage ====\nIn 1997, Ohno was a cast member of Kyo to Kyo with Musical Academy (MA) leader Shingo Machida and continued to act in other stage productions such as Koichi Dōmoto's Mask and Shōnentai's Playzone after Kyo to Kyo was over. Since then, he has done a number of stage plays such as True West with Masahiro Matsuoka and West Side Story with bandmates Sho Sakurai and Jun Matsumoto.\nThe Pū (プーシリーズ, Wind) series that Ohno starred in spanned from 2003 to 2008, consisting of Sengokupū (センゴクプー), Bakumatsu Banpū (バクマツバンプー), Tensei Kunpū (テンセイクンプー), and Amatsukaze (アマツカゼ). In Tensei Kunpū, Ohno portrayed a man named Kaoru Kazamine who was accidentally sent back to the Edo period of Japan through a system malfunction.\n\n\n==== Drama ====\nIn 1999, Ohno made his TV drama debut in the volleyball-centered short drama V no Arashi (Vの嵐), which was Arashi's first drama together.\nIn 2008, Ohno was given his first starring role in the suspense drama Maō. He co-starred with Toma Ikuta and portrayed a two-faced lawyer who sought for revenge against the person who murdered his brother years ago.\nIn 2009, he starred in his first comedy drama Uta no Oniisan (歌のおにいさん, Brother of Songs). With Kanjani Eight member Ryuhei Maruyama as his co-star, Ohno played a musician who unexpectedly becomes a singing character for a children's program after being dumped by his girlfriend, kicked out of his band, and labelled useless by his family. Ohno also took part in a television mini-drama project titled 0 Gōshitsu no Kyaku (0号室の客, Guest in Room 0), which aired from October 2009 to April 2010 and starred a select number of different artists from Johnny's. Ohno was the lead actor in the first story of the project called \"Akogare no Otoko\" (憧れの男, Yearning Man), which ran for four episodes in total. The story was about a salaryman and a club hostess visiting a strange \"Room 0\" that can reveal anyone's \"grade\" as a human being.\nIn January 2010, Ohno co-starred with the other members of Arashi in the human suspense drama special Saigo no Yakusoku (最後の約束, Last Promise). Ohno portrayed Satoru Mashiko, a 28-year-old employee of a cleaning company who is caught up in a building hijack. Beginning in April 2010, Ohno starred in the live-action adaptation of the manga and anime Kaibutsu-kun. Ohno played Tarou Kaibutsu, the prince of Kaibutsu Land who is ordered by the king to go to the world of humans for training as he is deemed unfit for the succession of the throne. He then reprised his role of Kaibutsu-kun for the Kaibutsu-kun special which aired on June 26, 2010. Ohno also starred in the second story, Hajime no Ippo (はじめの一歩, First Step), of the Fall 2010 Yonimo Kimyōna Monogatari (世にも奇妙な物語) special that aired on October 4, 2010.\nIn October 2011, Ohno once again reprised his role of Kaibutsu-kun for another Kaibutsu-kun special, leading up to the story of the 3D movie version.\nOn January 3, 2012, Ohno starred in the drama special Mou Yuukai Nante Shinai (もう誘拐なんてしない, I Won't Kidnap Anymore). He played the role of Shotaro Tarui, a freeter who can't forget his childhood dream of being a hero. However, he finds himself planning a fake kidnapping after he receives a request from the daughter of a boss of racketeers, played by co-star Yui Aragaki. Beginning in April 2012, Ohno co-starred with Erika Toda in his first Getsuku drama, Kagi no Kakatta Heya (鍵のかかった部屋, Locked Room). He played the lead character, Kei Enomoto, an employee at a major security firm who has an obsession with keys and locks. Enomoto works with a pair of attorneys, solving mysteries that fall under the \"locked room\" genre, in which seemingly impossible crimes are committed.\nOn August 24, 2013, Ohno starred in the drama special Kyou no Hi wa Sayounara (今日の日はさようなら, Farewell for Today) which aired as part of the annual 24 Hour Television telethon in Japan. Ohno plays a 29-year-old man named Kouta who is diagnosed with malignant lymphoma. Given three months left to live, he makes a resolve to accept his fate and face death properly.\nOn January 3, 2014, Ohno reprised the role of Enomoto Kei for the Kagi no Kakatta Heya special. He also starred in the live-action adaptation of the manga Shinigami-kun beginning in April 2014. Ohno portrayed Shinigami-kun (Shinigami No.413) whose job is to pronounce death to expected people and take their souls to the spiritual world. As a rookie reaper, he tends to make biased decisions towards the human side which always causes him to be reprimanded by his boss.\nBeginning in April 2016, Ohno starred in a drama titled Sekai Ichi Muzukashii Koi (世界一難しい恋, The World's Most Difficult Love). Ohno played Reiji Samejima, a company president in the hotel industry. Despite his success at work, he knows little about love. This romantic comedy follows Samejima as he pursues Misaki Shibayama, his very first love interest.\n\n\n==== Film ====\nIn 2002, Ohno made his motion picture debut in Arashi's first movie together, Pikanchi Life Is Hard Dakedo Happy (ピカ☆ンチ Life is Hard だけど Happy, Pikanchi Life is Hard But Happy). He portrayed Haru, a bizarre high school student who gets swindled during his trip to Harajuku. Two years later in 2004, Ohno reprised his role for the sequel Pikanchi Life Is Hard Dakara Happy (ピカ☆☆ンチ Life is Hard だから Happy, Pikanchi Life is Hard Therefore Happy). Ohno reprised his role as Haru once again in 2014 in a spin-off of the two previous films, titled Pikanchi Life Is Hard Tabun Happy (ピカ☆★☆ンチ Life is Hard たぶん Happy, Pikanchi Life is Hard Maybe Happy).\nIn 2007, the group came together once again to act in their third movie together, Kiiroi Namida (黄色い涙, Yellow Tears), with Ohno acting as an oil painter.\nIn 2011, Ohno returned to the big screen starring as the lead actor in the film Kaibutsu-kun the Movie. His character, Tarou Kaibutsu, is about to be crowned king, but is met with unexpected booing. Trying to escape to the human world, Tarou and his three henchmen accidentally find themselves in a place known as the Curry Kingdom where he is mistaken as a legendary hero. The cast went overseas to India to shoot parts of the film. He became the first member in Arashi to star in a 3D film.\nIn May 2016, it was announced that Ohno will star as the lead actor in the film Mumon: The Land of Stealth (忍びの国), set to premier in summer 2017. Mumon: The Land of Stealth illustrates the epic battle between the Oda clan and the Iga ninja. Ohno plays Mumon, an Iga ninja renowned to be a deadly assassin with unmatched battle strength, but who is also equally lazy and only seeks to earn money to make his wife, Okuni, happy. In preparation for the film, Ohno underwent intensive training in sword fighting.\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nOhno had his own radio show called Arashi Discovery, which aired every weekday from Monday to Friday on FM Yokohama from October 1, 2002, to March 31, 2017.\n\n\n=== Art ===\nWhen Ohno was in the third grade, he was inspired by his classmate's Dragon Ball illustration to start drawing.

A new version of Freestyle, called Freestyle 2020 opened on September 9, 2020, and had pieces from his previous exhibitions, as well as new ones, including the cover art for Arashi's single \"Kite\".\nBecause of his talent in the field of art, Ohno was appointed to host a four episode documentary for NHK entitled \"Jakuchu Miracle World\" starting on April 25, 2011. The documentary focused on analyzing artwork by a famous Edo era artist named Itō Jakuchū. On August 22, 2012, Ohno hosted another documentary for NHK entitled \"Everything Is for the Sake Of Delivering Dreams ~Walt Disney Trajectory of Creation~\".

    "text": "3Deep were a soul-pop music boy band composed of American actors Eddie Cibrian (Sunset Beach, Third Watch) and Joshua Morrow (The Young and the Restless), and Canadian singer CJ Huyer.\nTheir success was mostly in Canada, Europe and Asia as their record label did not release their debut album in the United States.\nTheir first album Yes Yes Yes...No No No was released in 1999 and featured their biggest hit single \"Into You\", a top-10 hit on the Canadian charts. Their second album Can't Get Over You was released in 2001. Among the artists they collaborated with were Michie Mee on a track from their first album and with Howie Dorough on a track from their second.\nAlthough 3Deep were largely unknown in the US (despite Cibrian and Morrow's acting successes), they were one of the more successful Canadian boy bands of the era, with a sizeable young female fan base. \nIn addition to touring, the group performed at events such as Ottawa's Winterlude and appeared on the Juno Awards and at MuchMusic studios.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n2001 News Article on 3Deep[usurped]"

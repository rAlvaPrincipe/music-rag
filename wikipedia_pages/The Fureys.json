    "text": "The Fureys are an Irish folk band originally formed in 1974. The group consisted initially of four brothers who grew up in Ballyfermot, Dublin.\nBrothers Eddie, Finbar, Paul and George Furey are of Irish Traveller heritage. Two of the band's singles have been number one hits in Ireland, and two of their albums charted in the United Kingdom. In collaborations with Davey Arthur, they have also been credited as The Fureys and Davey Arthur.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nPrior to the band's formation, two of the brothers toured as a duo, known simply by their names as Eddie and Finbar Furey. For a while in 1969–1970, the duo performed with The Clancy Brothers and appeared on two of the Irish folk group's albums. The second of these albums contained two songs composed by the Fureys, \"Flowers in the Valley\" and \"Jennifer Gentle\". In the meanwhile, their youngest brother Paul Furey had, together with Davey Arthur and Brendan Leeson, formed a band called The Buskers. Eddie and Finbar and the Buskers appeared together in Germany at the \"Irish Folk Festival\" in 1974, where they performed as The Furey Brothers. The Buskers, now with the addition of George Furey, appeared there again a year later as The Furey Family, when they were joined by their father Ted, a renowned traditional fiddler, who was 73 at that time. Ted Furey had recorded a solo fiddle album Toss the Feathers released by the Outlet label in 1967.\n\n\n=== Band ===\nFinbar, Eddie, and Paul Furey formed a folk group called Tam Linn in 1976 with Davey Arthur. When their brother George joined them later that year, the band changed its name to The Furey Brothers and Davey Arthur. They eventually simplified their name to The Fureys and Davey Arthur (and just The Fureys when Arthur did not perform with them).\nThe band started out playing traditional Irish folk music, but quickly changed their sound, leaving the folk music behind, and turned to mainstream easy-listening songs and ballads.\nIn 1981, The Fureys released their most successful single \"When You Were Sweet Sixteen\", which became a worldwide hit, reaching No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 1 on the Irish Singles Chart and No. 9 on the Australian Singles Chart. \"The Green Fields of France\" (a title commonly but incorrectly given to Eric Bogle's \"No Man's Land\") also gave them an Irish No. 1, remaining in the single charts for twenty-eight weeks. They also had two Top 40 British albums called Golden Days and At the End of the Day.\nOther notable songs include \"Gallipoli\", \"The Red Rose Cafe\", and \"Steal Away\". As of October 24, 2019 the band was still recording and touring. In 2018, the band celebrated their 40th anniversary.\nFinbar left the band to begin his own solo career in 1996, with Eddie, George, and Davey Arthur continuing some touring in Ireland, the UK and the European continent. Paul Furey died suddenly in June 2002.\nAll four of the brothers married and had children. Finbar's son, Martin Furey, is a folk singer and musician with The High Kings. George's son Anthony is the singer with the Young Folk. Eddie's daughter Sarah-Jane is a streamer in the video gaming industry.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Ted Furey and Brendan Byrne ===\nToss The Feathers, Outlet, 1967\n\n\n=== Eddie and Finbar Furey ===\nFinbar and Eddie Furey, Transatlantic, 1968\nThe Lonesome Boatman, Transatlantic, 1969\nThe Dawning of the Day, Dawn, 1972\nFour Green Fields, Pläne, 1972\nA Dream in My Hand, Intercord, 1974\nI Live Not Where I Love, Intercord, 1975\nThe Farewell Album, Intercord, 1976\nI Know Where I'm Going, 1976, (with Paddie Bell)\nThe Town Is Not Their Own, HPE, 1981\nFinbar and Eddie Furey, Harp, 1982\n\n\n=== The Clancy Brothers (with Finbar and Eddie Furey) ===\nChristmas, Columbia, 1969\nFlowers in the Valley, Columbia, 1970\n\n\n=== Finbar Furey ===\nTraditional Irish Pipe Music, Transatlantic, 1969\nThe Irish Pipes of Finbar Furey, Nonesuch, 1972\nPeace & Enjoyment, Love & Pleasure (with Brian McNeill)\nPrince of Pipers, Intercord, 1974\nSweetest Summer Rain\nThe Finbar Furey Songbook\nLove Letters, BMG, 1990\nThe Wind and the Rain, Nora, 1997\nChasing Moonlight, Hybrid, 2003\nNew York Girls, Rough Diamond, 2003, (EP)\nThe Last Great Lovesong, Pinorekk, 2014\n\n\n=== Ted Furey ===\nIrish Folk Music, Arfolk, 1972\n\n\n=== The Buskers ===\nLife of a Man, Rubber Records, 1973\nThe Buskers, Hawk, 1974\n\n\n=== The Fureys and Bob Stewart ===\nTomorrow We Part, Crescent, 1976\nAran: Celtic Gypsy Music, 1999\n\n\n=== The Furey Family ===\nThe Furey Family, Intercord, 1977\n\n\n=== The Fureys and Davey Arthur ===\nEmigrant, Polydor, 1977\nMorning on a Distant Shore, Polydor, 1977\nBanshee, Dolby, 1978\nThe Green Fields of France, Banshee, 1979\nThe Sound of the Fureys and Davey Arthur, Polydor, 1980\nWhen You Were Sweet Sixteen, Banshee, 1982\nSteal Away, Banshee, 1983\nIn Concert, RTÉ, 1983\nGolden Days, K-Tel, 1984\nAt The End of the Day, K-Tel, 1985\nThe First Leaves of Autumn, 1986\nRed Rose Café/Irish Eyes/Sitting Alone, 1987,(EP)\nDublin Songs, 1988\nPoor Man's Dream, 1988\nThe Scattering, 1988\nAlcoholidays\nThe Best of the Fureys and Davey Arthur, 1993\n\n\n=== The Fureys ===\nWind of Change, Shanachie, 1992\nCladdagh Road, 1994\nMay We All Someday Meet Again, 1996\nTwenty One Years On, 1999\nThe Essential Fureys, 2001\nThe Fureys Sing Chaplin, 2001\nMy Father's House, 2003\nI Will Love You, 2003\n25th Anniversary Collection, 2003\nMy Father's House, 2005\nThe Times They Are a Changing, 2014\n40 Years.....to be continued, 2018\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nFinbar Furey\nDiscography at TheBalladeers.com"

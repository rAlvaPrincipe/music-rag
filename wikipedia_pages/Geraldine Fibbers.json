    "text": "The Geraldine Fibbers were an alt-country band founded in 1994 by Carla Bozulich.  Initially, band members included Bozulich, Daniel Keenan, Julie Fowells, William Tutton and Kevin Fitzgerald. While Bozulich had previously been known for noisy industrial music, The Geraldine Fibbers fused American roots music and blues-influenced punk.\nJulie Fowells left the band quite early and was replaced with Bronwyn Adams who played violin on most of the pre-Virgin recordings.\nJust as the group signed to Virgin, Bronwyn Adams departed and was replaced with Jessy Greene who remained until mid-1997.\nThe group always incorporated noise and experimentation into their sound, which has been mis-labeled as Alternative Country. In early 1996, Keenan departed, to be replaced by Nels Cline, the band shifting to an even more noisy, guitar-rock sound.\nJessy Greene stayed with the band until both Virgin albums had been recorded.  Greene was replaced with Leyna Marika P. who, due to prior commitments, could not join immediately.  Jessica Moss was recruited to fill in for Leyna on the Butch tour.  However, in 2017 when Lost Somewhere Between the Earth and My Home was reissued with bonus tracks, it is Jessica Moss playing violin on the new track, \"Thank You for Giving Me Life\".  \nSpin magazine named Lost Somewhere Between the Earth and My Home and Butch to their top albums of 1995 and 1997 lists, respectively.\nMoss joined A Silver Mt. Zion in 2001. The Nels Cline Singers and an enormously diverse biography surround Nels Cline. In 2004 he joined the alternative band, Wilco. Fitzgerald has played with Eleni Mandell, The Circle Jerks and others. William Tutton is now a Los Angeles-based session musician, and has performed live with numerous acts, such as the Grandmothers, Chris Stamey, Glen Meadmore, Los Super Elegantes, El Vez, Badwater Bob, and the Wild Honey Orchestra. Bozulich made her 4th album for her group, Evangelista on Constellation Records.  \nIn April 2017, it was announced that Lost Somewhere Between the Earth and My Home would be reissued on vinyl by Jealous Butcher Records on May 5, 2017. The reissue will be mixed for vinyl by Steve Fisk and include \"Bitter Honey\" and \"234\" from the original sessions, a previously unreleased studio version of \"You Doo Right\" featuring both Keenan and Cline on guitar, and a new song \"Thank You for Giving Me Life\" featuring Bozulich, Tutton, Fitzgerald, Cline and Moss as the lineup.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums and EPs ===\nGet Thee Gone – 10\" EP (1994, Sympathy for the Record Industry)\nThe Geraldine Fibbers – CD EP (1994, Hut)\nThe Geraldine Fibbers – promo CD EP (1995, Virgin) – it doesn't have an actual title, sometimes you can see it listed as G Fibbers or Bitter Honey\nLost Somewhere Between the Earth and My Home – CD (1995, Virgin)\nLive from the Bottom of the Hill – promo CD (1996, Virgin)\nButch – CD (1997, Virgin)\nButch – 2xLP (1997, Sympathy for the Record Industry)\nWhat Part of Get Thee Gone Don't You Understand? – CD (1997, Sympathy for the Record Industry)\nLost Somewhere Between the Earth and My Home – Record Store Day LP reissue with bonus tracks (2017, Jealous Butcher)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Marmalade/Get Thee Gone\" (Live) – 7\" (1994, Hut/Virgin)\n\"Dragon Lady\" – CDS (1995, Hut/Virgin)\n\"Dragon Lady/Birthday Boy\" – 7\" (1995, Sympathy for the Record Industry)\n\"Fancy/They Suck\" – 7\" (1995, Big Jesus)\n\"Marmalade\" – promo CDS (1995, Virgin)\n\"House Is Falling (Remix)\" – promo CDS (1995, Virgin)\n\"California Tuffy\" – promo CDS (1997, Virgin) – 2 different versions exist\n\"California Tuffy/Folks Like Me\" – promo 7\" (1997, Virgin)\n\"Din Din Goes to Space\" (Live) – 7\" (1994, Hut/Philippines)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nThe Poop Alley Tapes – track \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" (1995, WIN Records)\nDefinitivt Beat Nr 10-95 – track \"Get Thee Gone\" (1995, Beat (magazine))\nAll Over Me OST – track \"Dragon Lady\" (1997, TVT)\nAlright, This Time Just the Girls – edited version of \"Toybox\" (1999, Kill Rock Stars)\nDrinking from Puddles: A Radio History – live version of \"Butch\" (1999, Kill Rock Stars)\nJackson's Jukebox – track \"Butch\" (2000, Kill Rock Stars)\nRoot Damage – track \"She's a Dog\" (2003, Sympathy for the Record Industry)\n\n\n=== Videos ===\n\"Dragon Lady\"\n\"California Tuffy\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAshare, M.

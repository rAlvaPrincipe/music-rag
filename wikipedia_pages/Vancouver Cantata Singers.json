    "text": "The Vancouver Cantata Singers (VCS) is an auditioned Canadian choir in Vancouver, British Columbia, founded in 1959 by organist and conductor Hugh McLean.\nVancouver Cantata Singers was first formed under the name the Philharmonic Choir in 1958 as a non-auditioned community chorus. The first performance took place on February 6, 1959 at Christ Church Cathedral with the choir performing Bach’s Mass in B Minor. Positive reviews from music critics and successful appearances on CBC Radio eventually inspired the chorus to become an auditioned semi-professional ensemble in the early 1970s when James Fankhauser began to lead the group, winning the Healey Willan Grand Prize in 1984 and a Juno Award nomination for Best Classical Album (Vocal or Choral Performance) in 1994. From 2002 to 2012 the choir was headed by conductor Eric Hannan, who led the group to win the Healey Willan Grand Prize both in 2008 and 2011. In 2013, long-time VCS member Paula Kremer became artistic director, and in 2019 she led the group to several awards in the National Competition for Canadian Amateur Choirs, again including Canada Council's Healey Willan Prize.\nAlthough the ensemble's name implies focus on music of the Baroque period, the Vancouver Cantata Singers also perform contemporary music, working frequently with local Canadian composers such as Jocelyn Morlock, Peter Hannan, Kristopher Fulton, Imant Raminsh, Stephen Chatman, Jordan Nobles, Craig Galbraith, and they also perform pieces arranged by members of the choir.\n\n\n== Conductors ==\n2013–present: Paula Kremer\n2002–2012: Eric Hannan\n2001-2002: Peter Butterfield\n1995-2000: Tony Funk, Assistant Conductor - Associate Conductor, 2000/2001\n1973-2000: James Fankhauser\n1966-1973: John Wiebe\n1957-1966: Hugh McLean\n\n\n== Composers in residence ==\n2018–present: Craig Galbraith\n2014–2017: Kristopher Fulton\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nChristmas Reprise XVIII (2021)\nKristopher Fulton: The Twilight Cities (2015)\nRethink Forever (with musica intima, works by Peter Hannan), Winner of the Western Canadian Music Awards Outstanding Classical Recording 2011 (2011)\nVancouver Cantata Singers 50 (2011)\nA Christmas Reprise (2005)\nRheinberger: Sacred Music, Vol. 5 (1999)\nA 1640 Venetian Mass (1998)\nVenetian Vespers of 1640 - 1994 Juno Award Nominee; Association of Canadian Choral Conductor's 1994 National Choral Award: Outstanding Choral Recording (1994)\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n2019: National Competition for Canadian Amateur Choirs\n\nWinner of the Canada Council for the Arts Healey Willan Prize\nFirst Place: Mixed-Voice Adult category\nSecond Place: Contemporary category\nBest Performance of A Canadian Work in Any Category\n2011: National Competition for Canadian Amateur Choirs\n\nWinner of the Healey Willan Grand Prize\nFirst Place: Chamber Choir category \n2010: National Competition for Canadian Amateur Choirs\n\nFirst Place: Contemporary category \n2008: National Competition for Canadian Amateur Choirs\n\nWinner of the Healey Willan Grand Prize\nFirst Place: Chamber Choir category\n1984: CBC National Radio Competition for Amateur Choirs\n\nWinner of the Healey Willan Grand Prize \n1994: Juno Nominee Best Classical Album (Vocal or Choral Performance), Venetian Vespers of 1640\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\n\n\n=== Spinal Chord ===\nFrom 2009 to 2016, Vancouver Cantata Singers and the International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries held collaborative annual fundraisers (\"Spinal Chord\") to benefit spinal cord research and the arts through both non-profit organizations.

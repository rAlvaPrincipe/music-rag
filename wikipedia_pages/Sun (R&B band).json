    "text": "Sun is an R&B, soul, disco, and funk band that was formed in the mid-1970s and recorded prolifically for Capitol Records from 1976 to 1984. The band was founded by Byron Byrd in Dayton, Ohio, in 1976. Additional members included Kym Yancey, Chris Jones (later of Dayton), Gary King, John Wagner, Hollis Melson, and Shawn Sandridge.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter being signed to Capitol by Larkin Arnold, Sun was faced with an immediate problem: an incomplete band. The gap was in the rhythm section, so Byron Byrd recruited Roger Troutman and Lester Troutman (of Zapp) and paid them to do some studio sessions so he could finish the album. Lester laid drum tracks with Roger on bass, then Roger overdubbed guitar for four songs on the album, including  \"Live On, Dream On.\"  It was on \"Wanna Make Love (Come Flick My BIC)\" that Roger contributed his signature talk box embellishments.\nAs the first single from the debut LP, Live On, Dream On (1976), \"Wanna Make Love\" became Sun's first hit, peaking at #31 on Billboard’s R&B chart.\nWith the release of their second album, Sun Power (pressed on orange vinyl in 1977), Sun sprang into a ten-piece configuration of multi-instrumentalists and vocalists that consisted of Byron Byrd, John Hampton Wagner, Christopher D. Jones, Hollis Melson, Dean Hummons, Kym Yancey, Shawn Sandridge, Bruce Hastell, Gary King and Ernie Knisley. The album also contained the songs “Conscience” and \"Time Is Passing” (sampled by many rap artists, including Dr. Dre) plus the instrumental “We’re So Hot,” which has been used in sports telecasts.\nSun had people from NASA do the cover animation for their fifth album, Sun Over The Universe (1980).\n\n\n== Original group members ==\nByron M.

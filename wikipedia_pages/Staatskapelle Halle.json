    "text": "The Staatskapelle Halle is a German symphony orchestra based in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Part of the umbrella organisation Theater, Oper und Orchester GmbH Halle, the orchestra performs symphonic concerts, and also serves as the orchestra for the Oper Halle.  \n\n\n== History ==\nThe historical precursor ensemble was the Hallische Stadtorchester, formed in 1852.  Separately, Max Richards founded the Stadttheater-Orchester, and later in 1907, the Hallesche Orchester-Vereinigung. The theatre orchestra evolved into the Handel Festival Orchestra by 1957.\nIn 1934, Bruno Vandenhoff became the first Generalmusikdirektor (GMD) in Halle. In 1946, Arthur Bohnhardt established the Hallische Volkssinfonieorchester, but left for West Berlin in 1949. This ensemble received the new name Staatliches Sinfonieorchester Halle in 1954.  \nIn 2006, the current Staatskapelle Halle was formed from the merger of the Philharmonischen Staatsorchesters with the Handel Festival Orchestra.  Karl-Heinz Steffens was the first Generalmusikdirektor of the orchestra under its present name, from 2008 to 2013. Josep Caballé Domenech was the next chief conductor, from 2013 to 2018. \nIn September 2018, the orchestra announced the appointment of Ariane Matiakh as the new Generalmusikdirektorin of the Theater, Oper und Orchester GmbH Halle, effective with the 2019-2020 season.  Matiakh was the first female conductor ever to be named to the posts.  In January 2020, by mutual agreement, Matiakh resigned from the company.\nIn May 2022, the orchestra announced the appointment of Fabrice Bollon as its next GMD, effective with the 2022-2023 season, with an initial contract of 5 years.  Bollon and the Staatskapelle Halle have recorded commercially for such labels as Naxos. \n\n\n== General Music Directors ==\nKarl-Heinz Steffens (2008–2013)\nJosep Caballé Domenech (2013–2018)\nAriane Matiakh (2019–2020)\nFabrice Bollon (2022–present)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial German-language homepage of the Staatskapelle Halle\n'Aus alter Last wird neue Lust', NMZ website"

    "text": "Emory Brace Remington (1892–1971) was a trombonist and music teacher.  His unique method made him one of the most well-known and influential trombone educators in history. He was a member of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra from 1923 to 1949, and on the faculty of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, NY from 1922 until his death in 1971.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Rochester, New York on December 22, 1892, Emory Remington began his musical studies in the Boys' Choir of an Episcopal Church.  His Father, Fred Remington, a brass instructor who played cornet and trumpet, presented young Emory with a trombone at the age of 14.  By the age of 17 he was a member (and regular soloist) with the Rochester Park Band.\nAs a young trombonist, Remington studied with Gardell Simons, Principal Trombonist of the Philadelphia Orchestra. \nIn 1917 Remington joined the United States Navy and was assigned to the orchestra at a training station near Chicago.  One of his bunkmates in the Navy orchestra was comedian/violinist Jack Benny whom he spoke of with admiration.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nUpon returning from the Navy, Remington joined the Eastman Theater Orchestra in Rochester, also becoming a faculty member at the Eastman School of Music in 1922. His performing career was marked by lengthy tenure as Principal Trombonist with both the Rochester Philharmonic and the Eastman-Rochester Orchestra, an amalgamation of the Philharmonic and the Eastman School of Music. He would remain on faculty there for the rest of his life. As a trombone teacher, he was affectionately known to his students as \"The Chief\". He developed a system of legato warm-up exercises (now immortalized by Donald Hunsberger in his book, The Remington Warm-Up Studies (ISBN 0-918194-10-5)) which have had major influences on trombone practicing up to the present time.\nRemington was fond of singing, and during his lessons, he would sing along with the student's trombone sound. He also encouraged his students to look for music to play that was outside of the common literature for trombone, especially music that would improve the singing characteristics of their trombone playing. His emphasis, whether in warm-up or in practice, was on relaxation and playing in a \"conversational\" and \"singing\" manner. This was quite different from the more traditional trombone methods of the time which focused on more marcato and regimented technical studies such as the Arban Method.\n\nAnother of Remington's contributions was the Eastman Trombone Choir formed in 1941. A large ensemble of trombonists would gather to play music written for multiple trombones or transcribed from other sources, such as the chorales and fugues of Johann Sebastian Bach. Separating the different musical parts (i.e. SATB: soprano, alto, tenor, bass) into sections of trombonists, and transposing the music into the proper registers for the trombone. Remington encouraged his students to transcribe music for this ensemble, amassing a large library of \"new\" works for it. The music of J. S. Bach became the backbone of the ensemble. Remington used this great music as a tool to train his students in the art of ensemble performance. Ralph Sauer has made a fine reputation with his beautiful transcriptions of the music of Bach. Donald Hunsberger's transcription of Bach's Passacaglia and Fugue is considered one of the first of the great Bach transcriptions for trombone choir.\nSelected sections from his method include exercises designed around sustained long tones, security in the high register, legato tonguing, flexibility or \"lip-slurs\", and \"pattern scales\" (which would create a trombonist equally adept in all the keys).\nIn 1954, Remington completed work in conjunction with C.G. Conn Ltd. in developing the C.G. Conn 88H tenor trombone. The unique tone color and dynamic range of the instrument have made it popular amongst trombonists and contributed to its continuous production from its debut in 1954 to the present. Conn also manufactured a \"Remington\" tenor trombone mouthpiece which was available in either silver or gold plate. Remington encouraged his first-year students to switch to this mouthpiece, as it produced a beautiful clear sound with moderate effort. The effect of the 88H combined with the Remington mouthpiece produced a very uniform sound in the Trombone Choir and trombone sections in the large ensembles. As students progressed, they would be encouraged to switch to other mouthpieces to refine their sounds depending on performance conditions.\nRemington taught at the Eastman School for 49 years, teaching countless students, some of whom rank among the finest trombonists in history. He died on December 10, 1971. On October 20, 1979, Room 310 at the Eastman School of Music was formally named the Emory B. Remington Rehearsal Room.\nRemington (band) was named after Remington's son, David Remington (1926–2007). His daughter, Janet Remington was Principal Harpist with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra for many years.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRemington was married to Laura W. (née Wilbur) Remington (1891–1966) a professional organist and pianist. Together, they had three children, David, Emory Jr., and Janet.\nDavid (1926–2007), the eldest, was a jazz trombonist, had his own big band in Chicago, toured, and made some recordings. Emory Jr. worked for Eastman Kodak. Janet was a world-class harpist, having studied with Eileen Malone. She became the Principal Harpist with the Pittsburgh Symphony under William Steinberg.\n\n\n== A Partial List of Emory Remington's Students and their Principal Career Positions (in alphabetical order) ==\n\nTrombonists who studied with Emory Remington at the Eastman School of Music:\n\nEarly Anderson – Jazz artist; New York City Broadway productions and recordings\nEdwin Anderson – Cleveland Orchestra, Indiana University\nHerbert (Sonny) Ausman – Los Angeles Philharmonic, recording engineer\nEd Bahr – Delta State University, Erie Philharmonic, Montgomery Symphony (AL), and the Great Lakes Chamber Orchestra (MI)\nCharles Baker – New Jersey Symphony Orchestra\nJames Bates – U.S. Army Band arranger, National Gallery Orchestra, L.A. freelance arranger, AMTRAK troubleshooter\nThomas Beversdorf – Indiana University, Saddler Well Ballet, Pittsburgh Symphony, Houston Symphony, Rochester Philharmonic.\nRoger Bobo – Rochester Philharmonic, Royal Concertgebouw, Los Angeles Philharmonic (Bobo studied briefly with Remington at Eastman)\nAlan Bomwell – District Manager (retired) Conn-Selmer, New York music teacher\nFred Boyd – Syracuse Symphony Orchestra, South Carolina Philharmonic, Chautauqua Symphony (Bass Trombone & Tuba), Private Low Brass Teacher\nRobert Boyd (BM '43) – Cleveland Orchestra\nRobert Brawn –\nKen Bruce –\nDouglas Burden (BM '75) – National Arts Centre Orchestra, McGill University, University of Ottawa, Queen's University, Capital BrassWorks\nLarry Campbell – United States Coast Guard Band (Ret.) and Louisiana State University (Ret.)\nGordon Cherry (BM '71) – Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, CBC Radio Orchestra, University of British Columbia, National Arts Center Orchestra, Cherry Classics Music publishing\nM.

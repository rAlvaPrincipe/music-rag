    "text": "The Margarines were a J-Pop group made in 2014, at the time Japan was going through a debt crisis. So the creators of the group saw an opportunity to offer a job for about 500 struggling women. The point of the Margarines was to provide jobs to girls which would help them resolve their debts worth about 800,000 US dollars. From a former member Marie Krause, “We learnt that the group lost even more money instead of gaining more.” The group had been featured in many shows, but as expected the group was taken more as of entertaining group which got old quickly instead of being loved and taken seriously. Marie Krause had also shared even more of her trauma in that group. The girls had been hit a lot for entertainment and the host would make them undress too. And Marie shares they were not paid from all of this. \n\nThe Margarines were a Japanese idol girl group.\n\n\n== Concept ==\nThe Margarines was founded with the purpose of clearing their members' debts of about ¥127 million and the idea that \"people with big debt have big dreams.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

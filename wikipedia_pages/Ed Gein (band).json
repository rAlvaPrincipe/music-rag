    "text": "Ed Gein was an American grindcore band, based in Syracuse, New York. The band consisted of Graham Reynolds (guitar, vocals), Aaron Jenkins (bass, vocals) and Jesse Daino (drums, vocals). The band takes its name from the American murderer of the same name. The band is best known for its second album, Judas Goats and Dieseleaters (2005). The follow-up record, titled Bad Luck, was released in 2011.\nEd Gein's music has been labeled as grindcore, metalcore, mathcore and noise rock, featuring influences from thrash metal.\nOn their third album, Bad Luck, the band shifted from their previous technical grindcore in favor of a more hardcore punk-influenced sound. The band's lyrics, primarily written by bassist Aaron Jenkins, are politically charged and features social commentary, on topics including racism in the United States, sexism, homophobia and bureaucracy.\nOn April 11, 2018, it was announced the band had split up and the members would be forming a new band called Shadow Snakes.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nGraham Reynolds – guitar, vocals\nAaron Jenkins – bass, vocals\nJesse Daino – drums, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nIt's a Shame That a Family Can Be Torn Apart by Something as Simple as a Pack of Wild Dogs (2002)\nJudas Goats and Dieseleaters (2005)\nBad Luck (2011)\nEPs\n\nEd Gein (2002)\nSmoked (2016)\nCompilations\n\nIt's a Shame (2005)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

Both the album and DVD debuted at № 1 on Oricon's DVD and album chart in the same week.\nIn September 2010, Avex Entertainment announced plans to suspend all of JYJ's Japanese activities.

Entertainment and Avex ==\nIn mid-2009, Jaejoong, Yoochun and Junsu (then-members of group TVXQ) filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment, arguing that the 13-year length and structure of their exclusive contracts as well as the terms of profit distribution were unilaterally and unfairly disadvantageous towards the artists and should be invalidated. The Seoul Central District Court in October 2009 ruled in their favor affirming their right to independently engage in entertainment activities and granted them injunction suspending the SM contracts; its ruling emphatically pointed out it was a \"subjugating contract\" with terms that are grossly incompatible with Korean labor and contract law. The three members of JYJ continued their activities in Japan for over half a year after the filing of the injunction until their Japanese agency, Avex, unilaterally suspended their activities in 2010 and gave its support to the remaining two members of the original group. JYJ then filed an injunction to terminate their exclusive contract with Avex.\nOn February 17, 2011, the Seoul Central District Court dismissed SM Entertainment's injunction against the three members, filed in April 2010 for damage compensation. In September 2012, the final decision on the case was postponed indefinitely by Seoul Central District Court for mediation under the justice department.\nOn November 28, 2012, during a voluntary arbitration at the Seoul Central District Court, SM Entertainment and JYJ reached a mutual agreement to terminate all contracts between the two parties and not to interfere with each other's activities in the future. This concluded the three years and four months long exclusive contract lawsuit in Korea.\nOn January 18, 2013, Tokyo District Court ruled against Avex in their claims of an exclusive contract in the management of JYJ in Japan and ordered Avex to pay 660 million yen as damages to JYJ’s Korean management company C-JeS Entertainment and 1 million yen as damages to the representative of C-JeS for defamation charges. Avex has filed for an appeal.\nOn February 16, 2014, C-JeS Entertainment and AVEX's long legal battle has been resolved. C-JeS Entertainment wrote on their official homepage, \"C-JeS (JYJ) and AVEX has agreed to end all the legal battles we have had. C-JeS (JYJ) and AVEX will no longer meddle in each other's affairs.\"\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nJYJ commemorated their inaugural group tour, The Beginning Showcase World Tour 2010, by donating the profits (about 44,000,000 KRW) from the Seoul showcase to World Vision International.

    "text": "Cartoons, also known as Cartoons DK, are a Danish Eurodance band, best known for their song \"DooDah\" and their cover of the 1958 novelty song \"Witch Doctor\", both hits released in 1998.\nThe group wears outlandish plastic costumes and wigs in live performances as caricatures of 1950s American rock and roll stars.\n\n\n== History ==\nCartoons started out as the Scooters in the late 1980s, playing rockabilly music from the 50s and 60s. In 1994, the Scooters released the album Live at Woodstock, and in 1997, they changed their name to Cartoons. Their musical style switched from rockabilly to \"technobilly\", their own expression of rock and roll mixed with Eurodance; many of their songs are remakes of old rockabilly hits that they covered as the Scooters. The group was first signed to FLEX Records, moving later to EMI Denmark. \nTheir most notable single to date is their cover version of Ross Bagdasarian's novelty song \"Witch Doctor\", which reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart.\nIt features a combination of the original's \"oo-ee-oo-ah-ah, ting-tang, walla-walla, bing-bang\" chorus (albeit lacking the record's double-speed playback of the chorus), driving dance beat and occasional guitar breaks. The group had further success in the UK with the Top 10 hit \"DooDah\" (a cover version of the American folk song \"Camptown Races\", albeit with completely different lyrics), the Top 20 hit \"Aisy Waisy\", which was performed on Jim Davidson's Generation Game, and a Top 20 debut album, Toonage (later rereleased with extra tracks as More Toonage).\nThe group's second album, Toontastic, did not match the success of its predecessor, but several notable hits were released from it, including \"Diddley-Dee\", \"Little Red Ridinghood\", \"Big Coconuts\", Lally Stott's \"Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep\" and a reworked cover of Les Humphries Singers' \"Mama Loo\". The group was one of several artists to contribute to the soundtrack of the 2000 animated film Help! I'm a Fish, with the track \"Wobble-Di-Bubble-Di-Doo\".\nIn 2001, Cartoons disbanded for unknown reasons. Toonie and Sponge later revealed on a Danish TV interview that they were due to tour in the US, but these plans were put to rest at the advent of the September 11th attacks. In 2005, the group made a brief comeback to promote their Greatest Toons release. It includes a new single, \"Day Oh\", both released by CMC Entertainment. They performed a number of shows throughout Europe, including at Bonbonland and the Jelling Musikfestival.\nIn July 2016, Karina Jensen died of cancer, which she was diagnosed with in 2012. She was survived by her husband and two children. In 2018, the group returned once again to perform at the \"We Love the 90s\" festival in Aalborg, Denmark. The following year, another compilation album, De Bedste, was released by Warner Music Group and X5 Music Group; it included a remix of their cover version of the Police's \"De Do Do Do De Da Da Da\" by Sponge. In April 2019, Erling Jensen died of lymphoma; he was 50 years old.\nIn 2020, the group returned to the studio with original producer Kenneth Bager to record a new single, \"Shots\", which was released in 2023. Later that year, they collaborated with Marnage to produce a faster version of \"DooDah\", titled \"DooDah 2K23\". As of 2024, Jesper Dukholt is the sole original member.\n\n\n== Members ==\nTrue to their name, the personnel of Cartoons has cartoon-inspired nicknames. The line-up is:\n\nToonie – lead vocals and backing vocals\nSponge – saxophone, keyboards and bass vocals\nShooter – lead guitar and backing vocals\nBuzz – double bass\nPuddy – backing vocals\nBoop – backing vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\n\n\n==== Compilation albums ====\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As main artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nCartoons at Bubblegum Dancer\nProfile of The Cartoons at eurodanceusa.com Archived 16 March 2012 at the Wayback Machine"

    "text": "PPK (Russian: ППК) is a Russian trance duo based primarily in Rostov-on-Don. The group consists of Sergey Pimenov and Alexander Polyakov. The name 'PPK' is the abbreviation of founding members' initials; K was for short-time member DJ Kordj (Roman Korzhov).\n\n\n== Career ==\nPPK became known internationally due to their single \"ResuRection\", which was available to download for free on mp3.com. The track had a few million downloads, which led to PPK signing a contract with Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label. The track was used to celebrate the New Year 2003 in Warsaw,  Poland (seen on Sky News Active, 31 December 2002).\nThe melody of \"Reload\" is based on the original melody «Поход» (\"Crusade\") written by Eduard Artemyev for the 1979 Soviet movie Siberiade.\nOn this music was based the melody of \"Zodiak\" from the album Disco Alliance by Latvian electronic rock band Zodiaks.\nThe group finally broke up in 2011 after reuniting for a small concert tour in Russia in 2010.\nOn 23 February 2016, former member Roman Korzhov died from cancer.\nOn 5 May 2022, PPK announced the release of \"Inspiration\" on their official VK page.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nЧувствуйте неспать!

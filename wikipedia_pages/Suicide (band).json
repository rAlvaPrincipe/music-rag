    "text": "Suicide was an American musical duo composed of vocalist Alan Vega and instrumentalist Martin Rev, intermittently active between 1970 and 2016. The group's pioneering music used minimalist electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers and primitive drum machines, and their early performances were confrontational and often ended in violence. They were among the first acts to use the phrase \"punk music\" in an advertisement for a concert in 1970—during their very brief stint as a three-piece including Paul Liebegott.\nThough never widely popular among the general public, Suicide have been recognized as among the most influential acts of their era. Their debut album Suicide (1977) was described by Entertainment Weekly as \"a landmark of electronic music\", while AllMusic stated that it \"provided the blueprints for post-punk, synth pop, and industrial rock.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1969, Alan Bermowitz became involved with the publicly funded MUSEUM: A Project of Living Artists—an artist-run 24-hour multimedia gallery at 729 Broadway in Manhattan. Producing visual art under the name Alan Suicide, Bermowitz graduated from painting to light sculptures, many of which were constructed from electronic debris. He gained a residency at the OK Harris Gallery in SoHo where he continued to exhibit until 1975. Barbara Gladstone continued to show his work well into the 1980s.\nLater that same year, Bermowitz saw The Stooges perform at the New York State Pavilion; an epiphany for Bermowitz. He would later say, \"It showed me you didn't have to do static artworks, you could create situations, do something environmental. That's what got me moving more intensely in the direction of doing music. Compared with Iggy, whatever I was doing as an artist felt insignificant.\" \nAfter this, in 1970, Alan Vega and Martin \"Rev\" Reverby met through the [Art Workers' Coalition. With Rev, Bermowitz began experimenting with electronic music, and formed Suicide, along with guitarist Paul Liebgott. According to a 2002 interview of Alan Vega, the name of the band was inspired by the title of a Ghost Rider comic book issue titled \"Satan Suicide\". He further explained, \"We were talking about society's suicide, especially American society. New York City was collapsing. The Vietnam War was going on. The name Suicide said it all to us.\"\nTheir first show was June 19, 1970 at the Project of Living Artists in lower Manhattan. They soon began billing themselves as \"punk music\". Liebegott left at the end of 1971, and they continued as a duo. By that point, Vega was no longer playing any instruments, and began performing only vocals. Rev stopped playing drums and blowing whistle by early 1975. Suicide emerged alongside the early glam punk scene in New York, playing with the likes of the New York Dolls and the Fast. They began to court a reputation for confrontational live shows inspired by Iggy Pop. Many of the band's early shows were at the Mercer Arts Center, alongside bands such as the New York Dolls and Eric Emerson and the Magic Tramps. During an early show at the Mercer Arts Center David Johansen played harmonica with Suicide. Vega and Rev both dressed like 'arty street thugs', and Vega was notorious for brandishing a motorcycle drive chain onstage. Vega once stated, \"We started getting booed as soon as we came onstage. Just from the way we looked, they started giving us hell already.\" After the collapse of the Mercer Arts Center in 1973, Suicide played at Max's Kansas City and CBGB (before being banned), often sharing the bill with emerging punk bands. Their first album was reissued with bonus material, including \"23 Minutes Over Brussels\", a recording of a Suicide concert that later deteriorated into a riot.\nTheir first release was \"Rocket U.S.A.\", which was included on the 1976 Max's Kansas City compilation. The following year, they recorded and independently released their debut album.Suicide (1977), on Red Star Records. Although initial press reviews were divided (with Rolling Stone in particular giving it a scathing review), media recognition has changed over the years. Nick Hornby writes, \"'Che', 'Ghost Rider'—these eerie, sturdy, proto-punk anthems rank among the most visionary, melodic experiments the rock realm has yet produced.\" Of note is the ten-minute \"Frankie Teardrop\", which tells the story of a poverty-stricken 20-year-old factory worker pushed to the edge. Critic Emerson Dameron writes that the song is \"one of the most terrifying, riveting, absurd things I’ve ever heard.\" Hornby, in his book 31 Songs, describes the track as something you would listen to \"only once\".\nThey played their first overseas shows in 1978, supporting Elvis Costello and the Clash in the UK and Western Europe. After a tour opening for the Cars, Alan Vega received a call from Michael Zilkha of Ze Records asking if he could sign Suicide to his label. They subsequently recorded their sophomore album Suicide: Alan Vega and Martin Rev with Ze at the Power Station studios. While the album was a critical success, it was not a commercial success, Alan Vega felt that \"nothing big for us happened\" after the second album was released in comparison to the first album.\n\n\n=== 1980s and beyond ===\nAfter the second album's release, Suicide would sporadically release new music, mostly to mixed critical and commercial reception, releasing their last album, American Supreme, in 2002. During this time, they both became involved in their own projects. In 1986, Alan Vega collaborated with Andrew Eldritch of The Sisters of Mercy on the Gift album, released under the name of The Sisterhood. In 1996, Vega collaborated with Alex Chilton and Ben Vaughn on the album Cubist Blues. Vega and Rev have both released solo albums.\nIn 2005, SAF Publishing put out Suicide No Compromise, a \"docu-biography\" by David Nobahkt, which featured extensive interviews with Vega and Rev as well as many of their contemporaries and fans.\nIn 2008, Blast First Petite released Alan Vega 70th Birthday Limited Edition EP Series—a monthly, limited-edition series of 10\" vinyl EPs and downloads by major artists, honoring Alan Vega's 70th birthday. Among those paying tribute were Bruce Springsteen, Primal Scream, Peaches, Grinderman, Spiritualized, The Horrors, +Pansonic, Julian Cope, Lydia Lunch, Vincent Gallo, LIARS, and The Klaxons. The label also released Suicide: 1977–1978, a 6-CD box set, the same year.\nIn September 2009, the group performed their debut LP live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series.\nIn May 2010, the band performed the entire first album live at two London concerts, double billed with Iggy & The Stooges performing Raw Power. The band performed their final concert at London's Barbican Centre on 9 July 2015. Billed as 'A Punk Mass', the show featured solo sets by both Rev and Vega before a headlining Suicide performance. Henry Rollins, Bobby Gillespie, and Jehnny Beth made guest appearances. The concert received positive reviews.\nThey played their final shows in 2015, canceling Shows scheduled for the following year due to Vega's declining health and eventual death. Alan Vega died in his sleep on July 16, 2016, at the age of 78. His death was announced by musician and radio host Henry Rollins, who shared an official statement from Vega's family on his website.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nRev's simple keyboard riffs, which were initially played on a battered Farfisa organ combined with effects units, before changing to a synthesizer, were accompanied by primitive drum machines. This provided a pulsing, minimalistic, electronic backdrop for Vega's murmuring and nervy vocals. It was the first band to use the term punk to describe itself, which the band had adopted from an article by Lester Bangs. Some of the band's earliest posters use the terms \"punk music\" and \"punk music mass\".\nThe duo was influenced by musicians such as Elvis, Roy Orbison, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, Johnny Burnette, Lou Reed, Captain Beefheart, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Fats Domino, The Stooges, John Coltrane, Albert Ayler, Question Mark & the Mysterians,  and Silver Apples. Additionally, Martin Rev was a student of Lennie Tristano.\nThey were also influenced by films and directors such as Alejandro Jodorowsky’s El Topo, David Lynch, and John Waters.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nMusicians who have listed Suicide as an influence include, among others, Television, Chrome, Wire, Public Image Ltd, Gary Numan, Richard Hell, Pere Ubu, Patti Smith, Talking Heads,  Cabaret Voltaire, Steve Albini (from Shellac, Rapeman, and Big Black), Head of David (covered \"Rocket USA\"), Gang Gang Dance, Kap Bambino, Spacemen 3, Spiritualized, Angel Corpus Christi (covers of \"Dream Baby Dream\" and \"Cheree\" with Alan Vega guest vocals), Michael Gira of Swans, MGMT, Sky Ferreira, Sonic Boom, Loop, The Fleshtones (both of whom have recorded cover versions of \"Rocket USA\"), Ric Ocasek of The Cars, Mi Ami,  Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, Bono Vox, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Bauhaus, The Sisters of Mercy, Soft Cell, Sigue Sigue Sputnik, The Scientists, The Birthday Party, Joy Division, New Order, Nick Cave, D.A.F., Erasure, the music of Giant Haystacks, The KLF, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, OMD, Rocket from the Tombs, Cassandra Complex (and covered \"Frankie Teardrop\"), Mudhoney, Ariel Pink, Nitzer Ebb, Depeche Mode, R.E.M.

A total of 3,000 copies were pressed and released on March 30, 2009.\n\"Ghost Rider\" was covered by the garage punk band The Gories, and released on the album Cheapo Crypt Sampler No. 2. In April 2011, the influential dance-punk band LCD Soundsystem used a snippet from \"Ghost Rider\" during the song \"Losing My Edge\", and covered the Alan Vega solo effort \"Bye Bye Bayou\" during their final concert, held in a sold-out Madison Square Garden. The song was also covered by British duo The Last Shadow Puppets at New York City's Terminal 5, as a tribute to Alan Vega, shortly after his death in 2016. \nIn April 2012, Neneh Cherry released a cover of the song \"Dream Baby Dream\", which appeared on her album The Cherry Thing.

As of 2021 the band's most recent release is 2017's Anonymous Holes LP, which credits Ian Preston Cinnamon as the sole member.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2008, Sasha Grey began an industrial music collaboration with Pablo St. Francis. They later added Anthony D' Juan and Ian Cinnamon. The project's first EP, aVigillant Carpark was released in 2009 by Pendu Sound on 7-inch vinyl. Grey also contributed vocals to the Current 93 album Aleph at Hallucinatory Mountain.\n\nIn 2010, aTelecine released its first LP, ...And Six Dark Hours Pass, and followed it up with the first of three A Cassette Tape Culture compilations. Grey described aTelecine as \"experimental noise\", The Village Voice suggested it is electronic / ambient / minimal, and Todd \"Pendu\" Brooks called it dark ambient and death-dub. In 2011, aTelecine's first full-length album, The Falcon and the Pod, was released. Paul Maher Jr. compared Sasha Grey with Cathy Ames in John Steinbeck's novel East of Eden, described the ambient tracks of aTelecine as aural wrecking balls, stated that Grey's artistic temperament comes close to that of the Marquis de Sade as \"a proponent of freedom tethered to its furthest extremities, yet untethered by laws, morality or religion\", but admired her courage and audaciousness.\nIn 2012, Grey covered Nico for the X-TG album Desertshore. The first live concert of aTelecine took place on October 20, 2012, in Kraków at the Unsound Festival. \nIn July 2013, Sasha Grey announced her departure from the group. Ian Cinnamon and a new vocalist, Sveio, were the only remaining full-time members.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nThe Falcon and the Pod (2011)\nSounds That Gods Fear (2012)\nEntkopplung (Dais Records, 2012) \nThe Origin of the Obsolete Robot (2013)\nThe Inverse Of Square (Soundtrack) (2014)\nThe Burden Of Memory (Soundtrack) (2015)\nAnonymous Holes (2017)\nAnalog Sounds For Unknown Films (2021)\nI Remember Halloween (2023)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\naVigillant Carpark (2009)\nDer Baum Der Bosen E.P.

    "text": "The Manufactured Superstars are an electronic dance music DJ/production duo from Denver, Colorado consisting of Bradley Roulier and Shawn Sabo.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== DJ ===\nAs DJs, their performance style is high-energy, accessible and technically challenging. Their trademark stage costumes are matching NASA spacesuits and often share the stage with a six-foot-tall teddy bear. Sabo and Roulier have stated that their core philosophy is, \"We just wanna play great tunes and be the funnest DJs out there!\"\nTheir DJ performances have been described as \"mash-up\" or \"open-format\" by many in the music press. It is not unusual for the pair to play in excess of 100 tunes in the span of a two-hour DJ set, and those sets often traverse from mainstream pop to underground prog-house to urban-infused electro and beyond. The duo are expanding their radio mixshows and podcasts, and their club mixes can be heard on terrestrial, satellite and webradio stations worldwide.\nManufactured Superstars have played on the mainstage at outdoor festivals including Identity Festival, Nocturnal Wonderland, Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, the Beatport Pool Party during Miami Music Week, Red Rocks/Global Dance Festival and Lief Festival. They also have club residencies at XS night club inside The Encore in Las Vegas and Beta Nightclub in Denver, the latter of which Roulier is the owner. Other clubs they have also played at include LAVO, Pacha and Greenhouse in New York; Fluxx and Voyeur in San Diego; Playhouse in Los Angeles; Arkadia and LIV in Miami.\n\n\n=== History ===\n\n\n==== 2006 ====\nFormed in 2006, the Manufactured Superstars started on the American club scene of the late 1990s. Both are experienced producers; Roulier was also a leading club promoter in Colorado, and SABO traveled the U.S. as a drum-and-bass DJ and had had 20 commercial vinyl drum-and-bass releases.

    "text": "Ronald Frank Aldrich (15 February 1916 â€“ 30 September 1993) was a British easy listening and jazz pianist, arranger, conductor and composer.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born Ronald Frank Aldrich on 15 February 1916 in Erith, England, the only son of a store manager. He started playing the piano at three years old and was educated at the Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone and learned violin at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He travelled to India in the late 30s ahead of World War Two to play jazz and first gained fame in the 1940s as the leader of a Royal Air Force band called The Squadronaires who had a twenty-year-long career before they disbanded in 1964.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nAldrich was educated at The Harvey Grammar School, Folkestone, and taught violin at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Before the Second World War, he went to India to play jazz and first gained fame in the 1940s with the Squadronaires, which he led from 1951, when the band was then billed as Ronnie Aldrich and The Squadronaires, up until their disbanding in 1964.\nAldrich was noteworthy for the recording development of playing two pianos in his recordings (the Decca Phase 4 Stereo series). He recorded for the Decca Record Company Ltd in the 1960s and 1970s, moving to Seaward Ltd (his own company) licensed to EMI in the 1980s. He also regularly broadcast on BBC Radio 2 with his own orchestra as well as with the BBC Radio Orchestra and the BBC Scottish Radio Orchestra, based at BBC Glasgow. Aldrich also recorded special tracks that were released by Reader's Digest. All the Decca recordings have been released on CD format by Vocalion. Many of his sessions for radio stations have been released by Apple iTunes in m4a format.\nHe was appointed musical director at Thames Television, and thus was widely known as the musical director for the television programme The Benny Hill Show. \nHe was married twice and had a daughter from his first marriage. At the time of his death, he was married to Edith Mary Aldrich (1919-2006), his wife for more than 30 years. In later years he moved to the Isle of Man where he lived with his wife in Strathallan Castle, formerly the Clifton Hotel, in Port St. Mary, but he continued to work in London, where he remained a member of the local Branch of the Musicians Union. He died of prostate cancer at age 77 on 30 September 1993 in Clatterbridge, Cheshire.  He found his final rest at St. Luke's Churchyard, Baldwin Braddan, Middle, Isle of Man.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nRonnie Aldrich and the Squadcats\n\nAll Time Hits of Jazz, Ace of Clubs (ACL 1020) 1960 Remastered and re-released 13/10/09 as \"All Time Jazz Hits\", on double CD with \"Top of the World\".\nDecca Discography \"Ronnie Aldrich And His Two Pianos\"\n\nMelody and Percussion for Two Pianos, Decca Phase 4 PFS34007 (SP-44007) 1961\nRonnie Aldrich and His Two Pianos, Decca Phase 4 PFS4019 (SP-44018) 1962\nThe Magnificent Pianos of Ronnie Aldrich, London Phase 4 SP-44029 1963\nThe Romantic Pianos of Ronnie Aldrich, London Phase 4 SP-44042 1964\nChristmas with Ronnie Aldrich, London Phase 4 SP-44051 1964\nThe Magic Mood of Ronnie Aldrich, Decca Phase 4 PFS4064 (SP-44062) 1965\nThat Aldrich Feeling, Decca Phase 4 PFS4076 (SP-44070) 1965\nAll-Time Piano Hits, London Phase 4 SP-44081 1966\nWhere The Sun Is, Decca Phase 4 PFS4106 1966\nTwo Pianos in Hollywood, Decca Phase 4 PFS4108 (SP-44092) 1967 (*)\nTwo Pianos Today!, Decca Phase 4 PFS4132 (SP-44100) 1967\nFor Young Lovers, Decca Phase 4 PFS4141 (SP 44108) 1968\nThis Way \"In\", Decca Phase 4 PFS4152 (SP-44116) 1968\nIt's Happening Now, Decca Phase 4 PFS 4159 (SP-44127) 1969\nDestination Love, Decca Phase 4 PFS4179 (SP 44135) 1969\nTogetherness, Decca Phase 4 DDS 2, 1970\nHere Come the Hits!, London Phase 4 SP-44143 1970 (**)\nClose to You, London H-17156 1970 (**)\nLove Story, Decca Phase 4 PFS4222 (SP-44162) 1971\nGreat Themes To Remember, Decca Phase 4 1971\nInvitation To Love, Decca Phase 4 PFS4242 (SP-44176) 1972\nCome to Where the Love Is, Decca Phase 4 PFS4264 (SP 44190) 1972\nThe Phase 4 World of Burt Bacharach, Decca Phase 4 SPA193, 1972\nSoft And Wicked, Decca Phase 4 PFS4268 (SP-44195 H-17195) 1973\nTop of the World, London Phase 4 SP-44203, 1973\nThe Way We Were, Decca Phase 4 PFS4300 (SP 44209) 1974\nIn the Gentle Hours, Decca Phase 4 PFS 4329 (SP-44221), 1975\nLove, Decca Phase 4 PFS4361 (SP 44253) 1975\nReflections, Decca Phase 4 PFS4377 (SP-44264) 1976\nWebb Country, Decca Phase 4 PFS4397 (SP-44278) 1977\nWith Love & Understanding, Decca Phase 4 PFS4406 (SP-44286) 1977 (Evergreen USA)\nMelodies from the Classics, Decca Phase 4 PFS 4424(SP-44300) 1978\nEmotions, Decca Phase 4 PFS4436 (SP-44310) 1978\n(PFS is the Decca (UK) original catalogue number; SP is the London label (USA) version) /\n(*) Also issued as \"Romantic Screen Themes\" in Japan (London SLC4484) /\n(**) Togetherness (UK double-disc set) was issued as two separate albums in the USA\nDecca (Polygram) Discography (One Piano)\n\nTomorrow's Yesterdays, Decca PFS4436 1979\nFor The One You Love, Decca SKL5319 1980\nAmberjack Discography (One Piano)\n\nOne Fine Day, Amberjack 902, 1981\nImagine, Amberjack 1981\nBeautiful Music, Amberjack 1982\nSilver Bells/Winter Wonderland, Amberjack\nSeaward Music recordings licensed to EMI (One Piano)\n\nNight Birds, EMI MFP 1982\nSea Dreams, EMI MFP 1984\nFor All Seasons, EMI MFP 6016 1987\nRonnie Aldrich, his Piano and Orchestra, EMI CC220 1988 (compilation album)\nSeaward also issued a vinyl LP, The Wonderful World of Man, which contained recordings of the sounds of the Isle of Man, where Ronnie Aldrich lived from the 1960s onwards.

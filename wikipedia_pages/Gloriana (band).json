    "text": "Gloriana was an American country music group founded in 2008 by Cheyenne Kimball (vocals, mandolin), Rachel Reinert (vocals), and brothers Tom Gossin (vocals, guitar) and Mike Gossin (vocals, guitar). Prior to the group's foundation, Kimball recorded as a solo artist. The original lineup recorded one self-titled album for Emblem/Reprise Records in 2009, which included their first chart hit, \"Wild at Heart\". Kimball left before the release of the band's second album A Thousand Miles Left Behind, which produced their highest-charting single, \"(Kissed You) Good Night\", along with the top 20 \"Can't Shake You\". After a third album, Three, Reinert left as well, effectively disbanding the group.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBrothers Tom and Mike Gossin were born in Utica, New York. They both took classical piano lessons from age 5.  At 10, Tom began studying jazz with a local jazz musician and at 12, he began to play the guitar. Tom, along with third Gossin brother Stephen, founded their own band \"Oblique\" in high school. Stephen and Tom later moved to Wilmington, North Carolina together, where they attended University of North Carolina at Wilmington, with Tom majoring in guitar. After a professor suggested that he pursue songwriting and performing, Tom dropped out of the university and started playing music and selling independent records at gigs he played.  Mike learned drums at age 8 and, like Tom, started playing guitar at 12.  He moved to Wilmington after high school to join Tom there.  He joined a group with Tom and Stephen during which time they filmed a reality series that did not last long. Tom and Mike moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where they began performing as a duo.\nRachel Reinert was born in Sarasota, Florida, and lived in Marietta, Georgia before moving to Santa Ana, California with her family at age 6. She attended the Orange County School of the Arts, a charter performing arts school, where she studied musical theatre from 7th to 10th grade. She started playing the guitar and turning her poetry into songs at age 14.  With a teacher's help, she began recording demos, and was signed to a publishing deal out of Nashville at age 15. She graduated high school through independent study and moved to Nashville when she turned 16, and was working on her songwriting skills when she met the Gossins, who found her through her MySpace page.\nThe group's fourth and final member, Cheyenne Kimball, was born in Jacksonville, North Carolina but raised in Frisco, Texas. A performer by age 10, she entered the television talent show America's Most Talented Kid, and won the show's top honor at age 12.  One year after her win, Kimball recorded a solo album on Epic Records. This album included songs that she had written with John Rich of Big & Rich, whom she met after a trip to Nashville. When Cheyenne was in her late teens she had a reality show on MTV that lasted one season. She joined the Gossin brothers and Reinert after meeting them in a nightclub, and the four members began writing songs and performing together.\n\n\n=== 2008–2010: Gloriana ===\nOnce the four members of Gloriana were in place, they began recording demos, and sent one to Emblem Records, a label owned by Matt Serletic, a record producer who has worked with Matchbox 20. The four members worked with Serletic, and Nashville songwriters such as Jeffrey Steele, Brett James and Wayne Kirkpatrick, among others. By February the group had signed with the label but had not yet come up with a name.\nIn early 2009, the group released its debut single \"Wild at Heart\", which Serletic wrote with Josh Kear and Stephanie Bentley, another former Epic artist.

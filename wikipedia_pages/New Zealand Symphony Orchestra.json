    "text": "The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra (NZSO) is a symphony orchestra based in Wellington, New Zealand. The national orchestra of New Zealand, the NZSO is an autonomous Crown entity owned by the New Zealand Government, per the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra Act 2004. It is currently based in the Michael Fowler Centre and has frequently performed in the adjacent Wellington Town Hall before it was closed in 2013. It also performs in Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin.\n\n\n== History ==\nA national orchestra for New Zealand was first proposed with the founding of the Radio Broadcasting Company in 1925, and broadcasting studio orchestras operated in major cities from the late 1920s. A national orchestra was formed in 1939 for New Zealand's Centennial Exhibition in 1940.\n\nThe orchestra became permanent in 1946 in the aftermath of World War II as the \"National Orchestra of the New Zealand Broadcasting Service\" (by Oswald Cheesman and others); the inaugural concert took place on 6 March 1947. It was managed as a department of the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, which later became Radio New Zealand, as the NZBC National Orchestra.\nThe orchestra was renamed the NZBC Symphony Orchestra in 1963, and in 1975 renamed again to the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. In 1988, the orchestra became fully independent of Radio New Zealand, and began operating as an independent Crown-owned company.  Even after the formal separation of the orchestra from Radio New Zealand, NZSO performances continue to be recorded, broadcast and archived by Radio New Zealand Concert. Auckland Town Hall, Wellington Town Hall and Michael Fowler Centre performances are broadcast live-to-air and streamed online, and performances in other centres or overseas cities are usually recorded and broadcast at later dates.\nIn 2022 the orchestra performed a special 75th anniversary concert, conducted by Gemma New.\n\n\n== Performances ==\n\n\n=== Touring ===\nThe NZSO has always had a heavy touring schedule within New Zealand. It performed in Christchurch as early as 1947. It performs its core series of 12 programmes in Wellington and Auckland, about half of those in Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin, and visits several provincial cities each year. It has several times toured overseas, notably in 2005 to the BBC Proms, the Snape Maltings, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and the World Expo at Aichi in Japan.\n\n\n=== Conductors ===\nFranz-Paul Decker was the last NZSO conductor to have the title of chief conductor, and had the title of Conductor Laureate until his death in May 2014. The first conductor to have the title of Music Director of the NZSO was James Judd, from 1999 to 2007. Judd is now the orchestra's Music Director Emeritus.\nIn May 2007, Pietari Inkinen was named the NZSO's second Music Director, and he formally took up the post in January 2008.  Inkinen concluded his NZSO tenure in 2015 and subsequently took the title of honorary conductor. In June 2015, the NZSO announced the appointment of Edo de Waart as its next music director, with his first concerts in March 2016. De Waart's last concert as Music Director was in November 2019. In 2020 he became NZSO Conductor Laureate. NZSO Associate Conductor Hamish McKeich was appointed NZSO Principal Conductor in Residence from January 2020. Gemma New was appointed the orchestra's artistic director and principal conductor in 2022, the first woman to hold the position.\nThe orchestra's affiliated conductors to date include:\n\nAnderson Tyrer (1947–1950)\nMichael Bowles (1950–1953)\nWarwick Braithwaite (1953–1954)\nJames Robertson (1954–1957)\nJohn Hopkins (1957–1963)\nJuan Matteucci (1964–1968)\nFranz-Paul Decker (1991–1996, chief conductor)\nJames Judd (1999–2007, music director)\nPietari Inkinen (2008–2015, music director)\nEdo de Waart (2016–2019, music director)\nHamish McKeich (2016–2019, associate conductor; 2020–present, principal conductor in residence)\nGemma New (2022, principal conductor)\n\n\n=== Recordings ===\nThe NZSO has recorded several LPs and many CDs, several with internationally known soloists such as Alessandra Marc and Donald McIntyre.

The NZSO recorded part of Howard Shore's score for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, notably the \"Mines of Moria\" sequence, as well as an alternate version of the cue \"The Breaking of the Fellowship\".

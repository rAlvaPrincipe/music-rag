It was played in Miss World 1998 during the runway pass of a group of contestants, and also in Miss Universe 2002, this last one a different version of the song during the swimsuit competition.

Clark.\n\"Straight... to Number One\" was also featured in some advertisements, including one for Apple Computer's iTunes.

    "text": "The Groundhogs were an English blues and rock band founded in late 1963 in London. Named after John Lee Hooker's song \"Ground Hog Blues\", they were part of the burgeoning British rhythm and blues scene, backing Hooker on his album ...And Seven Nights. They were predominantly a power trio of Tony McPhee (singer, guitarist, song-writer), Peter Cruickshank (bass) and Ken Pustelnik (drums), with Clive Brooks replacing Pustelnik in 1972 until the band split in 1974. They issued seven albums via Liberty/UA, including the UK Top 10 Thank Christ for the Bomb (1970, #9), Split (1971, #5) and Who Will Save the World? (1972, #8).\nMcPhee resurrected the name with a different rhythm section in 1975 for two more studio albums, and again in 1982 to 2003 for a further two studio albums. A re-union of the early 1970s trio in 2003 ended Mcphee's run, with Cruickshank and Pustelnik continuing as The Groundhogs Rhythm Section. McPhee resurrected the name again in 2007 through to 2014, although only for live performances.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early years, 1962–1967 ===\nThe band were originally formed as the Dollar Bills in New Cross, London, in 1962 by brothers John and Peter Cruickshank (born in 1943 and 2 July 1945 respectively in Calcutta, West Bengal, India). Tony McPhee (born 23 March 1944, died 6 June 2023), the lead guitarist in the instrumental group the Seneschals, joined the group later that year. McPhee steered them towards the blues and renamed them after the John Lee Hooker song \"Ground Hog Blues\".\nAt John Cruickshank's suggestion, they became John Lee's Groundhogs when they backed Hooker on his 1964 UK tour. They later supplemented Little Walter, Jimmy Reed and Champion Jack Dupree when they toured the UK. McPhee featured on Dupree's From New Orleans to Chicago (1966) alongside Eric Clapton. Groundhogs issued \"Shake It\" backed with \"Rock Me\" on the Interphon record label in January 1965.\n\n\n=== Success with Liberty Records, 1968–1974 ===\nThe line-up on their first album, Scratchin' the Surface, produced by the 19-year-old head of A&R for Liberty Records, Mike Batt, and released in November 1968, consisted of McPhee as singer and guitarist, bassist Peter Cruickshank, Ken Pustelnik (born 13 March 1946 on a farm near Blairgowrie, Angus, Scotland) on drums and Steve Rye (born 8 March 1946 in London – died 19 July 1992, in London) on harmonica.\nRye left the band leaving them as a power trio to record Blues Obituary (September 1969), titled after McPhee \"realised that the audience for 12-bar blues was dwindling\". A single from the album \"B.D.D.\" (Blind Deaf Dumb), flopped in the UK but peaked at number one in Lebanon.\nThe group's next three studio albums, Thank Christ for the Bomb (May 1970), Split (March 1971) and Who Will Save the World? The Mighty Groundhogs (March 1972) were commercial and critical successes, reaching the Top 10 in the UK Albums Chart. Thank Christ for the Bomb,, titled by manager Roy Fisher who was hoping for some post-Lennon controversy, was promoted with BBC Radio 1 appearances on the  In Concert programme from Paris Cinema on 14 May, and a radio session for Mike Harding on 21 July.\nSplit peaked at number 5 and spent 27 weeks in the UK Albums Chart and achieved gold record status. The first side of the album was a four part suite inspired by McPhee having \"a mental aberration... a panic attack that lasted a few months\". They supported the Rolling Stones on their The Rolling Stones UK Tour 1971 in March at the request of Mick Jagger and their performance at Leeds University was recorded and later released in 1984 as part of the Hoggin' the Stage double album and subsequently re-released as Live at Leeds in  1998. The single \"Cherry Red\" released from the album was featured on BBC Television's Top of the Pops programme on 15 April, and the group performed studio sessions for BBC Radio 1's  Mike Raven's R&B show on 17 February, John Peel programme on 29 April,  and Mike Harding show on 29 March and 26 July.\nWho Will Save the World? The Mighty Groundhogs was promoted in 1972 with BBC Radio In Concert broadcast on 24 February, and session on 29 February at Maida Vale 4 for John Peel.\nPustelnik left during 1972 and Clive Brooks from the band Egg joined on drums for Hogwash, released in November. The group made their first tour of North America, but a horse riding accident suffered by McPhee ended their visit early. They made another appearance on the In Concert programme from Paris Theatre on 7 December.\nThe Solid album of 1974 saw a last return to the charts. A further live concert from Playhouse Theatre on 23 May was broadcast on the BBC Radio 1 In Concert programme .\nThe group broke up later in 1974, although the trio of McPhee, Cruickshank and Pustelnick recorded one final session for BBC Radio 1's John Peel show on 6 March 1975 at Maida Vale studios.\n\n\n=== New line-up, 1975–1976 ===\nMcPhee resurrected the name in 1975 with a new line-up of Martin Kent and Mick Cook on bass and drums respectively, and a second guitarist of either Dave Wellbelove or Rick Adams. Two albums, Crosscut Saw and Black Diamond, were released in 1976 by UA.\n\n\n=== New line-up, 1982–2003 ===\nMcPhee put together a new trio with Alan Fish on bass and Wilgar Campbell on drums, and after Mick Kirton had replaced Campbell issued the studio album Razor's Edge (1985), and the live album No Surrender recorded during the tour of the album was given a belated release in 1988.\nA new rhythm section of bassist Dave Anderson and drummer Mick Jones recorded Back Against the Wall (1986) at Anderson's Foel Studio and released on his Demi Monde label, and this trio also issued the live album Hogs On The Road recorded during a tour of Germany in December 1987.\nThe group's personnel continued to be changed; a live album Who Said Cherry Red? was recorded with Pete Chymon (bass) and Dale Iviss (drums) at a \"secret location\" in 1996, and two studio albums with Eric Chipulina and Pete Correa, Hogs in Wolf's Clothing (1998) in tribute of Howlin' Wolf and The Muddy Waters Song Book (1999) in tribute of Muddy Waters were released, being the last studio recordings issued as The Groundhogs.\nIn 2003, original manager Roy Fisher put together a short-lived 'original line-up' to celebrate their fortieth anniversary. McPhee left the band to pursue an acoustic career, embarking on a major tour in 2004 with Edgar Winter and Alvin Lee and issued an acoustic blues album Blues at Ten.\n\n\n=== The Groundhogs Rhythm Section, 2004–2014 ===\nAfter McPhee's dparture from the 2003 re-union, Cruickshank and Pustelnik continued forming The Groundhogs Rhythm Section with invited frontmen, latterly with Eddie Martin. The Groundhogs Rhythm Section's last recruits, Bob Bowles (guitar, vocals) and Jon Buckett (guitars, keyboards, vocals), joined Pustelnik and Cruickshank in February 2011.\n\n\n=== Final line-up, 2007–2014 ===\nMcPhee put together a new band in 2007, with long-time Groundhogs bassist Dave Anderson (ex-Hawkwind) and Marco Anderson on drums. This trio toured the UK in 2008 with Focus and Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash. The 2009 line-up of Tony McPhee's Groundhogs comprised McPhee, Anderson and previous long-term drummer Mick Jones.  As of 2011, the new Groundhogs' line-up consisted of McPhee, Anderson, Joanna Deacon (vocals), and Carl Stokes (drums) from the death rock band Cancer.\nDue to McPhee's ongoing health issues relating to a stroke in 2009, Tony McPhee & Groundhogs retired in January 2014, although McPhee and Stokes have since worked with David Tibet's Current 93. McPhee died on 6 June 2023.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\n\nGroundhogs initially formed as a blues band, but subsequently began incorporating elements of rock, psychedelic, progressive music and space rock into their sound. Prog magazine wrote, \"the four albums they recorded between 1970 and 1972 – Thank Christ for the Bomb, Split, Who Will Save The World? and Hogwash – saw the band become increasingly ambitious, both compositionally and conceptually, with the deployment of Mellotron and synth helping to create an exciting progressive/blues rock hybrid\". The band was also described as a \"shapeshifting blues/acid-rock power trio\".\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Members ===\n\nFormer members\n\n\n=== Lineups ===\n\n\n=== The Groundhogs rhythm section ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nas Groundhogs:\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nScratching the Surface (December 1968)\nBlues Obituary (September 1969)\nThank Christ for the Bomb (May 1970) – UK Number 9\nSplit (March 1971) – UK Number 5\nWho Will Save the World?

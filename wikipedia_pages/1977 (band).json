Kendall and Hough, who are married, formed 1977 in 2004 to perform and record these songs.\nIn 2009, the band released its self-titled nine-track debut album, Nineteen Seventy-Seven, which was a nominee for Adult Alternative Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2010. That year Kendall also performed alone as part of the Pitter Patter Festival in Toronto.\nIn 2011, they independently released the EP So Is the Sea; on it, they were backed by drummer Jordan Bruce and bassist Owen Marchildon, members of Hough's band Bellevue, and the album was recorded in the family's barn. That year 1977 performed took part in Canadian Music Week in Toronto.\nOn October 9, 2015, 1977 released their fourth album Twister.\nThe band went quiet in 2015. As of 2021, 1977 is being presented as 'Julie Kendall, an independent artist'.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nRock N' Roll (2008)\nNineteen Seventy-Seven (2009)\nSo Is the Sea (EP), (2011)\nTwister (2015), Fontana North\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

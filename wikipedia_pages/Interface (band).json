    "text": "Interface is an electronic music group based on Long Island, New York. It was founded in 1993 by Eric Eldredge (keyboards, sequences, and vocals). Its career has been lined with a steady output of songs and dance remixes for other artists and several lineup shifts. Each of its three albums to date display a blend of various styles of electronic music, most notably trance, synthpop, electro-industrial and aggrotech, with a strong sense of melody and songwriting.\n\n\n== Band history ==\nThe project became a serious entity when Eldredge left another group, Valve, in 1997. The band's inaugural lineup also included Joseph Destry (guitar, vocals) and Mike Cummings a/k/a DJ ANGZTEK (drums). In total Interface released four demo tapes between 1993 and 1998, with little interest from record labels or the music press. DJ ANGZTEK (Mindsett, Absolution) and Destry left Interface in 1998, leaving Eldredge as its sole member.\nInterface self-released the first LP The Artemis Complex in January 1999. New Brunswick, New Jersey based label Tinman Records signed the group, picked up the album and released it that summer. A rather ordinary sampling of Industrial and EBM aesthetics of the time, it did win Interface a small cult following, helped immensely by the mp3.com music website. The onstage lineup expanded to Eric's brother Evan Eldredge (guitar, keyboards, vocals) and Jon Billian (keyboards) that summer.\nThe second release, July 2002's Angels In Disguise, proved to be Interface's breakthrough into the dark electronic world. Besides a vastly improved overall sound, singles like \"Wasted Time\" and the title track saw heavy club, indie radio, and webcast play throughout North America and Europe. The higher profile landed them better remix work and live support slots (such as a 2003 show with The Human League). Despite the album's runaway success, Tinman fell into financial trouble, washing out a follow-up remix companion to Angels. Tinman finally shut down in 2005, just as the group announced a new album was in the works.\nIn 2005, after recording the album, titled Beyond Humanity, Interface began an exhaustive search for a new label, finally landing with Nilaihah Records, a Columbus, Ohio-based label founded by Kristy Venrick of The Azoic. Finally released in March 2006 as an expanded edition with extra tracks added on, the album once again solidified the group's songwriting and production ability. The album's tracks \"Age of Computers\" and \"Doubts and Fears\" found their way onto top compilation CDs (Cryonica Tanz 4 and The State of Synthpop 2005, respectively).\nEvan Eldredge left the group in 2006 to pursue other interests.\nIn 2006, the band collaborated with fellow New Yorker Viral Consciousness on a remake of Depeche Mode's \"Never Let Me Down Again\" for the Cryonica tribute album Bright Lights, Dark Room.\n2007 saw the debut of the band's most current touring lineup at the Black Sun Festival in August, now adding J. Joseph Dobise as an additional keyboard player and drummer Justin Parker. In addition, they finally recorded a cover of \"Land Of Confusion\" by Genesis for the Sigsaly Media compilation Machines Against Hunger (according to the Interface website, they have performed it live since 2003 and it was a fan favorite at concerts).\nThe Cryonica Tanz V5 compilation was announced on March 28, 2008 as including a new Interface song called \"Destination\", as remixed by Mindless Faith. On a Myspace blog on December 24, 2007 the band announced that a new album Destination Focus will be out in 2008, preceded by an EP called Modern Life. However, these names appeared reversed upon the release of Destination Focus as the EP on October 28. Visions Of Modern Life was released February 24, 2009 on Nilaihah. The first 200 copies sold from Nilaihah's mail order site also included a free copy of the Transit EP via digital download card.\nInterface has spent much of 2009 and 2010 with more tour dates and festival appearances as well as the release of an EP for the song \"Body Flow\", making it the third single pulled from Visions of Modern Life.\n\n\n== Members ==\nEric Eldredge - lead vocals, programming/sequencing, production, keyboards\nJonathan Billian - live keyboards, live guitar, programming/sequencing, sampling, vocoder\nJustin Parker - live electronic drums\n\n\n== Former members ==\nEvan Eldredge (1999–2006) - guitars, keyboards, backing vocals, additional production\nJoseph Destry a/k/a DJ CYN (1997–1998) - guitars, vocals, keyboards\nMichael A.

It is unclear how many of them are duplicates, or how many were one-off acts or projects that are currently still active.\nHollywood, California based producer/remixer/sound designer Julian Synne contributed several remixes to Cleopatra Records throughout the 1990s, with many of them being called an \"Interface Remix\". Many of these are available on the label's  extensive line of tribute compilations. Several websites have incorrectly attributed many of these tracks to \"this\" Interface.\nA jungle DJ/producer in England goes by the name Interface.\nUK sound engineer and music producer Mark Summers began as a DJ whose sound evolved and career expanded.  In 1993-1995 he produced three or more 12\" vinyl Tuch Wood Records as \"Interface\" with other aliases for other tracks.  He produced and remixed many Chrysalis Music artists and their offshoot dance label Tuch Wood/Tuchwood Records, co-owned by DJ-producer Dave Lee (Joey Negro).\nhardcore legend Interface (aka Mike Ash)\nInterface was the name of an Italo disco group active in the late 1980s). They produced 2 notable singles, \"Plastic Age\" and \"Like Puppets\". The Last FM website has mistakenly merged them with the above incarnation.\nA Christian rock group made by members of a seminary in Fort Myers, Florida goes by the name Interface.\nA metal act from Lucerne, Switzerland emerged under the name, but usually adds \"Lucerne\" to avoid confusion.\nA one-off improvisational project released one album called Swank under the name in 2001, but have not done anything since.\nActive since early 2010s, a rock-pop band from Madrid, Spain goes by the name \"Interfaces\".\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Interface homepage\nNilaihah records page\nInterface's MySpace\nInterface's Yahoo Group\nInterface on Discogs.com"

    "text": "Wild was a five-piece classical female group. It was often compared to Bond because of the very similar makeup and style of both groups.\nAlthough most of the band was English, Iva Cojic and Andjelka Ristic were born in Serbia.\n\n\n== History ==\nWild played a range of different genres on their debut album Time, and their music ranged from Latin beats to Celtic inspired. Wild also played the main theme of the TV Show, 'Robinson Crusoe', exclusively at their concerts. Their album, Time, featured a version of the song \"The Eve of the War\" from Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds, which was produced by Wayne himself.\nWild made their debut in 2005, when they were the ambassadors for the Spring Racing Carnival in Melbourne, Australia. Their music was constantly used on Channel 7.\nThe band also toured Malaysia in 2005.\nThe group has since split up. Two of the members are now part of Escala, a similar four-piece classical group who supported McFly in 2005 and appeared on Britain's Got Talent in 2008.

    "text": "The Bryan Ferry Orchestra is a retro-jazz ensemble founded and led by Bryan Ferry. They exclusively play his work in a 1920s jazz style. Ferry formed the orchestra out of a desire to focus on the melodies of his songs, and \"see how they would stand up without singing\".  Their album, The Jazz Age, was released on 26 November 2012 as a 10in vinyl folio edition and on 12in vinyl, CD and digital download, on BMG Rights Management  Ferry neither plays nor sings with the orchestra; BBC reviewer Chris Roberts called it a \"peculiar concept then, with Ferry now, almost Warhol-like, sagely mute to one side while collaborators silkscreen his own icons. As fascinating as it is perplexing, anything but obvious, and therefore to be applauded.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Performance ===\nColin Good - Piano & Arrangements\nEnrico Tomasso - Cornet & Trumpet\nMalcolm Earle-Smith - Trombone\nRichard White - Alto & Bass Saxophones, Clarinet & Bass Clarinet\nRobert Fowler - Tenor Saxophone & Clarinet\nAlan Barnes - Alto & Baritone Saxophones, Saxinet\nMartin Wheatley - Banjo & Guitar\nJohn Sutton - Drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Jazz Age (26 November 2012)\nMusic from Baz Luhrmann's Film The Great Gatsby (6 May 2013)\n\"Love Is the Drug\" (with Bryan Ferry)\n\"Crazy in Love\" (with Emeli Sand√©)\nA Selection of Yellow Cocktail Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film The Great Gatsby (The Great Gatsby Jazz Recordings) (10 May 2013)\nBabylon Berlin (Music from the Original TV Series) (2017)\n\"Dance Away\"\n\"Reason or Rhyme\"\n\"Bitters End\"\n\"Alphaville\"\n\"Chance Meeting\"\nBitter-Sweet (Bryan Ferry album) (30 November 2018)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Bryan Ferry website"

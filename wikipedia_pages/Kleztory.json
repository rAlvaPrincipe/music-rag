    "text": "Kleztory is a klezmer and world music ensemble founded in 2000 and based in Montreal, Quebec,  Canada. While remaining respectful of the rich heritage of klezmer, Kleztory takes the liberty of arranging parts of the traditional repertoire.  This gives their music their own personal uniqueness and flavor.  Kleztory is influenced by many sources of inspiration including jazz,  classical, gypsy, country, folk and blues. The ensemble were awarded both the Opus Prize in 2007 as the best Jazz / World Music album of the year in Québec for Nomade, and the Fürth Klezmer Prize at the 3rd International Jewish Music Festival in Amsterdam in 2012.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCurrent members include Elvira Misbakhova (violin), Airat Ichmouratov (clarinet, bass clarinet, duclar), Mark Peetsma (double bass), Raphaël D'Amours (guitar) and Melanie Bergeron (accordion).

    "text": "Harris & Ford are an Austrian DJ duo consisting of the two DJs, music producers and songwriters Kevin Kridlo and Patrick Pöhl.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in January 2011.\nLegendär, Das geht Boom and Tick Tack were the first musical successes of the duo. All three songs were able to place themselves in the official Austrian charts. Das Geht Boom stayed in the single charts for eight weeks and also reached number one in the DJ Charts Austria.\nWhile their productions were initially classified as pop dance, their current productions and releases can be classified as hardstyle, psytrance and big room. Harris & Ford have been under a contract with Kontor Records since early 2019.\nIn May 2019 they reached number 88 in the official German single sales charts with their song Freitag Samstag (feat. Finch Asozial). As a result, various international collaborations emerged. Also in May 2019, they released a single God Save the Rave along with Scooter. The single, Break the Beat followed in September, with the Italian DJ/producer team VINAI. In November 2019, they released an official remix of the Scooter single Devil's Symphony. In December, they released a remix of the track Hardstyle Girl from the project 'Hard But Crazy'. The remix peaked at number one on the Beatport Hard Dance.\nIn January 2020, they released the song Mutter together with the Dutch rapper Jebroer. The title is based on the Berlin Gassenhaur Mutter, der Mann mit dem Koks ist da from the late 19th century. In March 2020, Fight Back, together with Ummet Ozcan was released through Spinnin' Records. In April 2020, Harris & Ford, along with Norwegian DJ and producer team Da Tweekaz, released a new remix version of the song Moscow by Dschinghis Kahn. The song premiered at the World Cup Dome Winter Edition in Düsseldorf in January 2020. Another remix, He's a Pirate, was released in April 2020. In May 2020, the song Spotlight was released together with Dutch DJ and producer Sander van Doorn on Spinnin' Records.

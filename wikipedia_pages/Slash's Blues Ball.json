The band members comprised lead guitarist Slash, lead vocalist Teddy \"Big Bag Zig Zag\" Andreadis, bassist Johnny Griparic, drummer Alvino Bennet, rhythm guitarist Bobby Schneck and saxophonist Dave McLaurin. \nThey were formed by Slash after his departure from the group Guns N' Roses due to creative and personal disagreements. Andreadis had already worked with Slash in Guns N' Roses as an instrument technician and occasional live keyboardist or harmonica player. Slash's Blues Ball were a cover band, performing various hard rock, R&B and blues rock songs by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, B.B. King, Bob Dylan, and Fleetwood Mac.\nThe band was active for two years, and did not release any albums but various live recordings have circulated among fans. Andreadis and Griparic later collaborated with Slash on his 2024 album Orgy of the Damned and played in Slash's touring band for his S.E.R.P.E.N.T. Festival Tour. \n\n\n== Band members ==\nSlash – lead guitar\nTeddy Andreadis – lead vocals, harmonica, keyboards\nAlvino Bennet – drums\nJohnny Griparic – bass\nDave McLaurin – saxophone\nBobby Schneck – rhythm guitar\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Goldene Sieben (\"Golden Seven\") was a German jazz ensemble.\nThe Goldene Sieben was created in 1934 as the house band for the Berlin-based label Electrola. Henri René picked its initial members from noted local ensembles, but by 1935 the group was led by Georg Haentzschel. The group was broadcast on radio, though its contract forbade them from performing live. They appeared in the 1937 film Heimweh and recorded extensively.\n\n\n== Members ==\nTrumpet\nKurt Hohenberger\nTrombone\nWilly Berking\nErhard Krause\nGuitar/Banjo\nHenri René\nClarinet\nErnst Höllerhagen\nFranz Thon\nSaxophone\nEddie Brunner\nKurt Wege\nPiano\nWilly Stech\nPeter Igelhoff\nGeorg Haentzschel\nDrums\nFreddie Brocksieper\n\n\n== References ==\nRainer E.

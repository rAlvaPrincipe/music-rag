    "text": "Tommy is a 1972 album by the London Symphony Orchestra and English Chamber Choir, conducted  and directed by David Measham, performing arrangements by Wil Malone of The Who's 1969 album Tommy with additional arrangements by James Sullivan. The project was conceived and produced by Lou Reizner, initially with Rod Stewart singing Roger Daltrey's main role. As Pete Townshend and Daltrey became more involved, Stewart's role was reduced to singing \"Pinball Wizard\".\nThe studio version of the orchestral Tommy was issued in boxed-set LP format. It featured original artwork and photography, which used a pinball as its main motif, was designed by Tom Wilkes and Craig Braun and won the Best Album Package Grammy in 1974. The art was by Richard Amsel, Robert Heindel, Jim Manos, Alex Gnidziejko, Wilson McLean, Doug Johnson, David Edward Byrd, Robert Grossman, Charles White III, Richard Harvey and Mark English.\nThough it yielded no hit singles, the album fared well on Billboard's Top Pop Albums chart, debuting on 9 December 1972, peaking at #5, and remaining on the chart for 38 weeks.\n\n\n== Track list ==\n\n\n== Guest soloists in order of appearance ==\nNarrator: Pete Townshend\nNurse: Sandy Denny\nLover: Graham Bell\nFather: Steve Winwood\nMother: Maggie Bell\nHawker: Richie Havens\nAcid Queen: Merry Clayton\nTommy: Roger Daltrey\nCousin Kevin: John Entwistle\nUncle Ernie: Ringo Starr\nLocal Lad: Rod Stewart\nDoctor: Richard Harris\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References =="

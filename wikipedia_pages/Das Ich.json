    "text": "Das Ich is a German dark wave/gothic-industrial band formed in 1989. The group, fronted by Stefan Ackermann and Bruno Kramm, were one of the prominent founders of and contributors to \"Neue Deutsche Todeskunst\" (New German Death Art) a musical movement in the early 1990s. The band is known for having a classically-inspired gothic-industrial style, for their on-stage theatrics, and their almost exclusive use of German-language lyrics. The German term Das Ich makes reference to the Freudian concept James Strachey translated as \"ego\" (lit. \"The I\").\n\n\n== History ==\nBruno Kramm and Stefan Ackermann met in Bayreuth, Germany in 1989 at a nightclub called the \"Crazy Elephant\". Bruno had already been involved in several band projects, and after some hours of socializing the two decided to begin a project together.\n\nIn 1989, the members of Das Ich founded the Danse Macabre record label which released their first EP, Satanische Verse, and their first album, Die Propheten. Die Propheten was released in Germany in 1991 and was reissued in the US in 1997, selling over 30,000 copies. Their second album, Staub, was released in 1994 and charted in Germany for 11 weeks. 1994 also saw the release of the Stigma EP which featured a more industrial-dance sound with remixes of the album track \"Von der Armut.\" The band played many live shows in Europe but made its first US tour in June 1995 and a second, longer US tour of 13 shows, in 1997.\nIn 1998, the album Egodram, saw the group moving towards a more rhythmic, industrial dance-oriented sound, resulting in the club singles \"Kindgott\" and \"Destillat\". The album was followed by a tour in 1998 in the US and Mexico. Later in 1998, the band released their next album, Morgue, a concept album with lyrics based on the poems of expressionist writer Gottfried Benn.\nIn 1999, they released a remix album, Re-Laborat, that included Das Ich songs remixed by popular electro-industrial bands including And One, Funker Vogt, Wumpscut, and VNV Nation. The album ranked #31 on the German Alternative Chart's Top 50 Albums chart for 1999, while the U.S. re-issue peaked at #7 on the CMJ RPM Charts in 2001. Bruno Kramm released his solo spin-off Coeur in 2000. \nIn 2002, Das Ich released the album Antichrist, which is a critical reflection on world politics post-9-11. In 2003, the best-of album Relikt was released.\nIn 2004, they released the double album Lava, made of:\nLava:Glut: Disc with more instrumental than industrial tracks.\nLava:Asche: Disc with dance versions of songs from Lava:Glut.\nLava:Addendum: Bonus DVD packaged with some versions of the release.\n\nIn 2006, they released an additional dual album:\nCabaret: Disc with circus style songs, like the name implies, and more instrumental.\nVarieté: Disc with versions of songs from Cabaret remixed by bands including Stillste Stund, Metallspürunde, FabrikC, etc. In the same year, they released a new DVD, Panopticum.\nAfter 2010, the band underwent a short hiatus due to the health problems suffered by lead singer Stefan Ackermann, but the band had a revival with their performance at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen in 2013.\nIn 2017, the band remastered and re-released their first EP, Satanische Verse, as a limited-edition (500 copies) vinyl with additional tracks.\nIn 2018, an announcement about creating new album appeared on official website, originally scheduled for release in 2017 or 2018, that has yet to be released.\nIn March 2023 the band announced a South American tour — the seventh of their career — beginning in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nStefan Ackermann – lead vocals\nBruno Kramm – keyboards, synthesizers, programming, backing vocals\n\n\n=== Live band members ===\nStefan Siegl (Sissy) (2006)\nKain Gabriel Simon (2000–2006, 2016)\nDaniel Galda (1994–1999)\nChad Blinman (1994–1996)\nJakob Lang (1998–1999)\nMichael Schmid (1999–2000)\nRingo Müller (2006)\nDamian \"Plague\" Hrunka (2000–present)\nMartin Söffker - keyboards, backing vocals (2008–present)\n\n\n== In film ==\nMusic by Das Ich made up the soundtrack of the movie Das Ewige Licht (\"The Eternal Light\"), directed and produced by Hans Helmut Häßler.

    "text": "Rodney-O & Joe Cooley, consisting of rapper Rodney Oliver, also known as \"Rodney O\", DJ Joe Cooley (August 15 1965) and Jeffrey Page, also known as \"General Jeff\", is an American rap group from Southern California. Rodney O, from Riverside, and Joe Cooley, from Compton, and General Jeff, from Los Angeles. Best known for tracks such as \"Everlasting Bass,\" \"Cooley High,\" and \"This is for the Homies.\" At the height of their popularity, the group toured with MC Lyte, N.W.A, Kool Moe Dee and Grandmaster Flash. The group would gain more popularity in South Florida than their native Southern California, giving them a pioneering role in Miami bass.\nIn 2015, Rolling Stone named “Everlasting Bass” as one of the 20 greatest West Coast Rap Songs released prior to N.W.A's 1988 album Straight Outta Compton. After over a decade of silence, the group announced that they were planning a new album in 2011. The album was tentatively titled Joe And Me, but only the single \"That Supa Radio\" materialized.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1988 Me And Joe (Egyptian Empire) U.S. No. 187\n1990 Three the Hard Way (Atlantic) U.S. No. 128\n1991 Get Ready to Roll (Ichiban Records)\n1993 Fuck New York (Psychotic)\n1995 Everlasting Hits: The Best Of Rodney O & Joe Cooley (React)\n1998 The Final Chapter (React America)\n1999 Veteran's Day (Kritical)\n\n\n=== Charting singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\naudio Interview with Rodney-O & complete Biography on westcoastpioneers"

They formed a band together and in 2010, added Luke Davison and Gideon Bensen, calling themselves The Preachers.\nIn 2012, they changed the spelling of their name to the Preatures to avoid legal complications with other bands using similar names.

It was uploaded to Triple J Unearthed.\nIn 2013, they released their second extended play, Is This How You Feel?, which was preceded by two singles, \"Is This How You Feel?\" and \"Manic Baby\". \"Is This How You Feel?\" attracted considerable success, winning the $50,000 Vanda & Young Global Songwriting Competition, receiving a nomination for an ARIA Award for Best Pop Release, and being voted ninth in Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2013.\nThe band's debut studio album, Blue Planet Eyes, was released on 30 September 2014, peaking at No. 4 on the ARIA Albums Chart. At the 2015 ARIA Awards, the group were nominated in three categories.\nBensen left the band on good terms in March 2016. Their second studio album, Girlhood, was released on 11 August 2017 by Island Records. It was nominated for an ARIA Award for Best Rock Album. The single \"Yanada\" was co-written with Darug musician Jacinta Tobin. Along with the release of the single, the Preatures launched a campaign to help the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies raise money to maintain the documentation of Indigenous languages.\nFollowing a prolonged period of inactivity, Manfredi confirmed the end of the Preatures in 2021. She pursued a solo career, while Davison began playing drums for Australian artists Delta Goodrem and Dean Lewis. Moffitt pursued a career in production as well as playing guitar with Tyne-James Organ.

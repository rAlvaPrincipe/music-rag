    "text": "Metric is a Canadian indie rock band founded in 1998 in Toronto, Ontario. The band consists of Emily Haines (lead vocals, synthesizers, guitar, tambourine, harmonica, piano), James Shaw (guitar, synthesizers, theremin, backing vocals), Joshua Winstead (bass, synthesizers, backing vocals) and Joules Scott-Key (drums, percussion). The band started in 1998 as a duo formed by Haines and Shaw with the name \"Mainstream\". After releasing an EP titled Mainstream EP, they changed the band's name to Metric.\nThe band's first studio album, Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?, was released in 2003. Live It Out, released in 2005, was nominated for the 2006 Polaris Music Prize for the \"Canadian Album of the Year\" and for the 2006 Juno Awards for \"Best Alternative Album\". Their third studio album, Grow Up and Blow Away, was recorded in 2001; it was initially planned as their debut album, but was delayed for many years and finally released, with some changes, in 2007.\nMetric's fourth album Fantasies was released in 2009. It was shortlisted for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for \"Canadian Album of the Year\", and won the \"Alternative Album of the Year\" at the 2010 Juno Awards. Metric also won the 2010 \"Group of the Year\". The fifth Metric studio album, Synthetica, was released in 2012. The band won two awards at 2013 Juno Awards: \"Alternative Album of the Year\" for Synthetica and \"Producer of the Year\" for Shaw. The art director/designer/photographer Justin Broadbent also won an award for \"Recording Package of the Year\" for Synthetica. Metric's sixth album, Pagans in Vegas, was released in 2015, and their seventh album, Art of Doubt, was released in 2018. Their eighth full-length record, Formentera, was released on July 8, 2022. Their ninth LP, Formentera II, was released on October 13, 2023 via their label MMI and Thirty Tigers.\nIn 2023, Metric ranked 41st on Rolling Stone's The 50 Greatest Canadian Artists of All Time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early years ===\nHaines was born in New Delhi, India, to American-born parents, and was raised in Fenelon Falls, Ontario. She grew up as a dual citizen of both Canada and the United States. Her father, poet Paul Haines (best known for his lyrical collaboration with Carla Bley in the 1971 jazz opera Escalator over the Hill), often made cassettes of rare and eclectic music for his daughter to listen to, and her early influences included Carla Bley and Robert Wyatt.\nHaines attended Etobicoke School of the Arts. There she met Amy Millan (future member of Stars and Broken Social Scene), and Kevin Drew (future member of Broken Social Scene). Haines and Millan briefly formed their first band around 1990 while at ESA. Haines attended the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in 1992–1993, at Toronto in 1995, and at Concordia University in Montreal in 1995–1996. She distributed in 1996 an early album titled Cut in Half and Also Double with a limited number of copies. The album included songs written and recorded during her student years.\nShaw, who was born in England and raised in Ontario, was attending a Boston music school when he befriended singer Torquil Campbell and Chris Seligman, both future members of the band Stars. Campbell convinced Shaw to apply to Juilliard Music School and the two moved to New York City. After a three-year classical music education at the institution, Shaw decided that his musical interests lay elsewhere; Shaw and Campbell returned to Toronto.\nIn the summer of 1996, Haines and Shaw met at Toronto’s Horseshoe Tavern.  Bonded over a mutual distaste of the music scene, they began dating and writing songs together. In 1997, Shaw released the studio album Life on the Clock which featured Haines singing on some songs. Shaw also moved to Montreal where Haines was living. In 1998, calling themselves Mainstream, the pair self-released the five-song Mainstream EP with an overall downtempo and electronic feel.\n\nAt some point in 1998, they changed the band's name to Metric, which was originally the name of a sound that Shaw had programmed into his keyboard while working on a song.\nIn the fall of 1998, Shaw, Haines, Campbell, and Seligman moved back to New York City, where they shared a loft in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Struggling financially during their two-year stay at the loft, Haines and Shaw were erstwhile roommates with future members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Liars and TV on the Radio.\nThat same year, the band signed a development deal with Warner Bros. Records. A producer in London listened to the demos they recorded in this period and offered to bring Metric to the United Kingdom for a possible record deal. Eager to escape from the crowded conditions of the loft, Haines and Shaw set off to London in early 2000 and signed a publishing deal with Chrysalis Records.\nWith the help of the producer Stephen Hague, Metric recorded a set of new wave/synthpop drum machine paced songs. The pair tired of recording demos, and in November 2000 returned to their Brooklyn loft to put a band together; they recruited Joules Scott-Key (a native of Flint, Michigan) as their drummer and Jarrett Mason as their bassist.\n\n\n=== Grow Up and Blow Away (2001–2002) ===\n\nMetric continued to work on their debut album in the first few months of 2001. Now dubbed Grow Up and Blow Away, they developed a more musically layered and mature sound than the earlier Mainstream EP. Haines and Shaw completed the album in April and by this time had found a new label for their release, the Los Angeles indie label Restless Records. However, the album, produced by Shaw, was delayed for years by the label. It was finally released in 2007 on Last Gang Records.\nGrow Up and Blow Away included the uptempo songs \"Grow Up and Blow Away\", \"Raw Sugar\", and \"Soft Rock Star\", as well as downtempo songs \"White Gold\", \"The Twist\", and \"Rock Me Now\" (which included falsetto singing by Shaw and spoken-word vocals by Haines in a manner reminiscent of \"The Mandate\", and had an overall jazzy vibe). \"Parkdale\", featuring trumpeting by Shaw and a fanfare intro, concerned the Parkdale, Toronto neighborhood. When the track titled \"Rock Me Now\" was reworked, it had been stripped of its intro \"bubble\" sounds, as well as an additional vocal part was added to the bridge. The title track was also reworked during the chorus, in which, Haines vocalizes \"If this is the life, why does it feel so good to die today?\" and the synths get a more \"heavier\" feel.\nIn the same year, the band released Static Anonymity, a five-song EP which they sold only at Metric performances and on their official site. Three tracks from the EP were also included on Grow Up and Blow Away.\n\nMetric up to this time had been for the most part a studio band; live shows could not reproduce the synthesizer-centered and drum machine-driven sound of the recordings. After recruiting a drummer to allow a stronger, more engaging live presence, Metric performed in New York in early spring and late summer 2001. They handed out handmade CD-R copies of their unreleased music to fans at shows and by mail, and later gave away the music on the internet.\nIn August 2001 the television commercial \"Be Afraid\", advertising Polaroid's I-Zone Pocket Fortune film, used music from the song \"Grow Up and Blow Away\", with the line \"Why does it feel so good to die today?\" changed to \"Why does it feel so good to fly today?\".\nIn March 2002, Metric performed at Canadian Music Week. The band's performance was criticized in an article in University of Waterloo's newspaper Imprint, where the reviewer referred to the band's music as \"derivative, pretentious, boring pap at its most mediocre\".\nBy the end of 2002, Metric had gained another bandmate: the bassist Joshua Winstead (a native of Texas), who was in town performing with long-time friend Scott-Key in the local music scene.\n\n\n=== Old World Underground, Where Are You Now? (2003–2004) ===\n\nIn 2003, Metric released their first official studio album Old World Underground, Where Are You Now? on Everloving Records and shortly thereafter it appeared on the !earshot National Top 50 radio chart. The album was produced by Michael Andrews and recorded at Elgonix Labs, Los Angeles.  The band then moved to Los Angeles, where they performed locally, often playing at Silverlake Lounge and Spaceland. Old World Underground, Where Are You Now? received generally positive reviews. In December 2005, the album was certified gold in Canada.\nThe songs \"Combat Baby\" and \"Dead Disco\" were released as singles. \"Combat Baby\" was featured as a free single on iTunes in 2004. Six music videos were created to promote the album and accompany \"Calculation Theme\", \"IOU\", \"Combat Baby\", \"Succexy\", and \"Dead Disco\" respectively.\nMetric was featured as themselves in the 2004 independent French film, Clean, directed by Olivier Assayas and starring Maggie Cheung. The band performed the song \"Dead Disco\" in the film and also acted in a short sequence. The film, which also featured songs by Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, and Tricky, was nominated for the Palme D'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n=== Live It Out and Grow Up and Blow Away (2005–2007) ===\n\nOn October 4, 2005, Metric released their second studio album, Live It Out, on Last Gang Records. The album, produced by Shaw, was well received by critics and fans, and eventually went twice platinum in Canada, selling over 200,000 units.\nThree singles supported the album' sales: \"Monster Hospital\" (number 55 on UK singles charts), \"Poster of a Girl\" and \"Empty\". \"Monster Hospital\" was selected as NME Track of the Week and was number 12 on NME Tracks of 2006. Live It Out as well as number 38 on NME Recordings of 2006.\nDuring this time, Metric opened for the Rolling Stones, whose tour coincided with theirs in New York City. The band did a UK-wide tour supporting Bloc Party as well as performing at Reading and Leeds Festival, The Great Escape in Brighton, Wireless Festival at Hyde Park in London and club dates throughout the UK. The band toured the world extensively for several years playing concerts in France, Germany, Iceland, Brazil, Greece, Italy, Turkey, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, United States, Canada, Venezuela, Mexico and Japan to promote Live it Out.\nOn June 26, 2007, Last Gang Records released Metric's 2001 album Grow Up and Blow Away, with an altered track listing compared to the unofficial version. There were added the songs \"London Halflife\" and \"Soft Rock Star\" (Jimmy vs. Joe mix) from the 2001 EP Static Anonymity and removed the songs \"Torture Me\", \"Fanfare\" and \"Parkdale\". The tracks were reordered and some songs (including the title track and \"Rock Me Now\") were slightly reworked.\nThroughout the summer of 2007, four new songs were road-tested by the band, tentatively named \"Black Sheep\", \"The Hooks\", \"Stadium Love\", and \"Up in Flames\". On October that year Metric played a live webcast show on Myspace's \"Hey Play This\" programme, playing requests sent in by fans. Along with old material, they performed several new songs, including \"Freddie\" (aka \"Black Sheep\"), \"Standing in Line\", \"Gimme Sympathy\" (aka \"The Hooks\"), \"Twilight\", \"Joyride\" and \"Stadium Love\".\nOn November 13, 2007, Last Gang Records released a trailer on YouTube for a Metric DVD showcasing a live concert at the Metropolis Theatre in Montreal, as well as all three music videos from Live It Out. The DVD Live at Metropolis was released on February 12, 2008. A three-track EP was released on iTunes in December, featuring the live tracks \"The Police and the Private\", \"Too Little Too Late\" and \"Patriarch on a Vespa\" from the DVD, as well as the DVD trailer.\n\n\n=== Fantasies (2008–2011) ===\n\nThe band performed in 2008 in Canada, Mexico and Brazil while continuing to record their upcoming fourth album. They performed at the 2008 Coachella Festival, and at the 2008 Ottawa Bluesfest in addition to playing at the inaugural Pemberton Music Festival in Pemberton, British Columbia in July and All Points West Music & Arts Festival in New Jersey in August.\nDuring December 13–23, 2008, Metric toured across Canada with Tokyo Police Club, The Dears, and Sebastien Grainger and The Mountains, to raise money for various charities under the name \"Jingle Bell Rock\" tour. \"Help, I'm Alive\" was released as the lead single from the upcoming album on iTunes on December 23, 2008 in Canada and January 1, 2009 elsewhere.\nTheir fourth record, Fantasies, was self-released on April 7, 2009 through Last Gang Records in Canada, and their own label, Metric Music International. The album was produced by Gavin Brown and by Shaw; it was recorded at the band's Giant Studios in Toronto, and Electric Lady Studios, New York. Fantasies was issued in a standard edition (featuring 10 tracks), a deluxe edition (including 4 more tracks), a deluxe edition UK edition (including 10 more tracks), and later, an Expanded Edition (a second disc with 10 tracks).\nA fusion of new wave and loud rock, Fantasies was generally well received by critics and fans. By 2012 it had sold 500,000 copies, the band's best selling album so far. Haines and Shaw had performed all ten tracks acoustically the previous September at Union Pool in Brooklyn.\n\nThe music video for \"Gimme Sympathy\" was released on Myspace on March 16, 2009. Haines and Shaw completed a mini tour of acoustic shows across Canada, with stops in Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, and Victoria in late April with cooperation from local radio stations.  The band finished a Europe tour in May 2009 and toured the US (with Sebastien Grainger and The Mountains and Smile Smile), UK, and Canada at music festivals during the summer. They then headed to Australia for their first Australian tour in early October, and performed a show in Tokyo.\nIn August that year Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park fame began streaming a remix of the track \"Gold Guns Girls\"  through his website. The track was the theme for his art exhibition Glorious Excess (Dies), and later became part of a compilation album set up by Linkin Park's Music for Relief for victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\nIn October 2009, Metric released a five-track EP called Plug in Plug Out containing acoustic versions of songs from Fantasies, which was available on Amazon for 30 days. In December that year the band produced a charity T-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project to raise funding to promote musical education across Canada. The T-shirt bears the slogan 'Keep the dream tight' - a lyric from their song, \"Hustle Rose\".\nHaines and Shaw performed an acoustic version of \"Help I'm Alive\" on January 22, 2010 for the Canada for Haiti telethon. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Metric, along with several other Canadian music acts, came together in Vancouver to re-record K'Naan's song \"Wavin' Flag\" to benefit Haiti in a movement called Young Artists for Haiti. Haines and Shaw also performed at a Neil Young tribute event alongside their friends in Broken Social Scene. It was at this event that Haines met Lou Reed, leading to later collaborations between the two of them.\nThe track \"Black Sheep\" was released on August 10, 2010, and became available on the band's Myspace page. The song is on the soundtrack for the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. In the movie, the song is sung by Brie Larson, who portrayed Envy Adams in the film. Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O'Malley said he was inspired by concert photos of Haines while originally drawing Envy's singing poses.\nThe band toured in Western USA, before playing shows in the Canadian Maritimes and Eastern Ontario for most of March 2010.

The songs were then submitted online to Indaba and the band chose the winning remixes for the album. An unofficial album Electrified Fantasies featuring 14 remixes of songs of the album \"Fantasies\" appeared in January 2012. The tracks were selected from 1767 remixes that arose from the official remix contest and are licensed under a Creative Commons license.\n\n\n=== Synthetica and Cosmopolis (2012–2014) ===\n\nThe band's fifth studio album, Synthetica, was released on June 12, 2012 on the band's own label, Metric Music International, and received generally positive reviews.

Sounds generated by synthesizers are prominent in their songs.\nTheir sound evolved from the mellow/downtempo style of their early EPs and Grow Up and Blow Away album, to the new wave style of Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?, then more hard rock on Live It Out, then to the accessible indie rock of Fantasies, and to the more grandiose of Synthetica, and then the electronic of Pagans in Vegas, later fusing this with their gothic rock and new wave styles for Art of Doubt. Some of their songs (like \"IOU\", \"Succexy\", \"Combat Baby\", \"Monster Hospital\") include anti-war messages.\nThe band also recorded many covers from artists like Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, Pet Shop Boys, The Church, Death from Above 1979, Brenda Lee, Tom Waits, Neil Young, Blondie, The Strokes, Morrissey, Tame Impala and Elliott Smith. They also released many acoustic versions of some of their own songs on deluxe versions of some of their albums.\n\n\n== Touring ==\n\nMetric has toured extensively in North America, South America and Europe, but also have toured through Australia, The Philippines, and Japan.\nDuring Metric live performances, Haines sings and plays two synthesizers and occasionally plays a tambourine or a guitar. One of the two synthesizers is a Sequential Circuits Pro-One, which she has played at every live performance with the whole band since the Grow Up and Blow Away era. Her other keyboard is a Nord Wave with a custom built stand. James Shaw plays guitar and Winstead plays bass. Both Shaw and Winstead occasionally play a synthesizer each, and also sing backing vocals. Joules Scott-Key plays drums.\nThe band is also known for their acoustic performances as a duo, with Haines singing and/or playing various instruments (piano, harmonica, tambourine) and James Shaw playing the acoustic guitar and occasionally singing.\nMetric has performed at music festivals around the world, including Coachella, Osheaga, Bluesfest, Pemberton, All Points West, Glastonbury, Bumbershoot, Virgin Festival, Download Festival, Pukkelpop, Squamish, SXSW, Sasquatch!, La Route Du Rock, The Great Escape, Edgefest, Reading and Leeds Festival, Rock Werchter, Wireless, Splendour in the Grass, Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, and the Hillside Festival.

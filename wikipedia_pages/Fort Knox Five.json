    "text": "Fort Knox Five is a Washington, D.C., based musical group consisting of Steve Raskin, Rob Myers and Sid Barcelona. Jon Horvath was a member of the group until his death in 2015. The musical collective releases music through their self-run label, Fort Knox Recordings. Their music style mixes elements of funk, reggae, hip hop and electronic music.\n\n\n== History ==\nFort Knox Five was formed in 2003 by Steve Raskin, Rob Myers, Sid Barcelona and Jon Horvath. The group chose their name \"because our studio has always been called Fort Knox,\" though there were only four members in the group. The members hail from various side projects and previous outfits: Steve Raskin was originally part of Edsel and Raskal as well as ESL Music groups Liftoff and Thunderball; Rob Myers played sitar and guitar with Thievery Corporation and International Velvet and guitar in See-I; Jon Horvath recorded music with both DJ Dan and Raskal; and Sid Barcelona was also a part of Liftoff and Thunderball, like Raskin. The band formed their record label, Fort Knox Recordings, to release their music, and the label is now distributed by Washington, D.C.'s Dischord Records.\nIn 2005, Fort Knox Five opened for Gwen Stefani's Harajuku Lovers Tour throughout North America, playing numerous shows alongside Stefani and the Black Eyed Peas. The band was selected by Urb Magazine for their annual \"Next 100\" artists to watch.\nIn 2007, Fort Knox Five was selected to remix two Bob Marley songs, which were released on Roots, Rock, and Remixed. The band also selected as the resident DJ at the Eye Candy Sound Lounge at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.\nIn 2008, Fort Knox Five released their debut studio album, Radio Free DC, which features all four members of the band on production as well as numerous guest vocalists and musicians.\nIn 2009, Fort Knox Five began the year with a tour of Australia. Fort Knox Recordings then hosted a special inaugural event called The Funk 4 Peace Ball, which featured Afrika Bambaataa, 2Tuff and Nappy Riddem. In January, the group was featured on the soundtrack for EA's Skate 2 video game. The band also released Volume 1 of Radio Free DC Remixed in February 2009.\nFort Knox Five member Jon Horvath died on August 21, 2015.\nIn 2020, Fort Knox Five received the WAMMY (Washington Area Music Award) for Best Electronic/Techno Artist or Group\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nRadio Free DC (2008)\nPressurize the Cabin (2015)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nDodge City Rockers (2003)\nThe Big Score (2003)\nBlowing Up the Barrio (2004)\nThe Brazilian Hipster (2004)\nRadio Free DC (2005)\nThe Spirit of '75 (2007)\nBob Marley Remixed (2007)\nRadio Free DC Remixed Vol 1 (2009)\nRadio Free DC Remixed Vol 2 (2009)\nRadio Free DC Remixed Vol 3 (2009)\nRadio Free DC Remixed Vol 4 (2009)\nRadio Free DC Remixed Vol 5 (2009)\nRadio Free DC Remixed Vol 6 (2009)\nRadio Free DC Remixed Vol 7 (2009)\nRadio Free DC Remixed Vol 8 (2009)\nRadio Free DC Remixed Vol 9 (2009)\nRadio Free DC Remixed Vol 10 (2009)\nThe New Gold Standard Vol 2 (2010)\nShift Remixed EP (2010)\nBhangra Paanch Remixed EP (2010)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nThe New Gold Standard (2006)\nReminted (2007)\nRadio Free DC Remixed (2009)\nThe New Gold Standard 2 (2010)\n10 Years of Fort Knox Five (2013)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nRodney Hunter - Electric Lady (2004)\nDr. Rubberfunk - The Owner (2004)\nDynamo Productions - Get It Together (2004)\nJeff Settle - The Whistle Song (2005)\nTower of Power - This Type of Funk (2005)\nMo' Horizons - Drum 'n' Boogaloo (2005)\nRex Riddem - Salvador Diaspora (2005)\nTorpedo Boyz - Are You Talking To Me!??

    "text": "Rak-Su are an English R&B group, formed in Watford. In 2017, they won the fourteenth series of The X Factor, becoming the first male group to do so. The group is made up of Ashley Fongho, Jamaal Shurland and Myles Stephenson; Mustafa Rahimtulla, left the group in November 2020. They finished 2022 with a headline slot at Seal Bay Resort in Selsey, United Kingdom.\n\"Dimelo\", which features Naughty Boy and Wyclef Jean, was released as their winner's single, and marked the first time a winner's single was written by the winner. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number two, behind Ed Sheeran's \"Perfect\". Their self-titled debut extended play, Rak-Su, was released on 16 February 2018.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2016–2017: Formation and The X Factor ===\nRak-Su are a four-piece group consisting of childhood friends Ashley Fongho, Jamaal Shurland, Myles Stephenson and Mustafa Rahimtulla, from Watford. Fongho and Stephenson had been best friends since the age of 11, recording their freestyles together in their houses. Shurland emigrated from Barbados to Watford at the age of 12 and attended the same school with Stephenson and Rahimtulla. Shurland and Rahimtulla began performing together at the age of 14, and Fongho met and began performing with Rahimtulla at age 16. In their early twenties, Fongho met Shurland at a party after hearing him sing, and the two began recording and performing together, with Stephenson and Rahimtulla attending their recording sessions and live performances. By 2016, the four had decided to form their own music group and soon decided to audition for The X Factor in hopes of gaining exposure for their original material.\nIn 2017, Rak-Su auditioned for The X Factor in front of judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh, Sharon Osbourne and Nicole Scherzinger. Following producers' earlier advice against singing their original material, they began performing \"Señorita\" by Justin Timberlake until they were stopped by Cowell, who was unimpressed and requested a different song. They then performed an original song called \"I'm Feeling You\", and received four \"Yes\" votes from the judges, who praised the group for their originality, and Cowell noted that they would not have passed their audition on their first song alone.\nAfter the first bootcamp challenge, the group continued to perform their original material, reaching the six-chair challenge in the \"Groups\" category, mentored by Cowell. They passed the six-chair challenge with their original song \"Change Your Mind\" and after they performed their song \"Palm Tree\" at the judges houses' round in front of Cowell, and his assistant and former X Factor judge Cheryl. Cowell proceeded to put them through to the live shows.\nDuring the live shows, they continued to perform mainly original material, with two cover versions with additional raps by Fongho and Stephenson. They were runners-up of the Prize Fight in week 1 against Grace Davies and week 2 against Kevin Davy White, and were eventually voted as winners of the Prize Fight in week 4 against Davies, leading to a songwriting session with American songwriter Ali Tamposi as the reward. With the eliminations of Jack & Joel in week 3, Sean and Conor Price in the quarter-final and The Cutkelvins in the semi-final, Rak-Su became Cowell's remaining act in the competition. They made it to the final on the weekend of 2 December 2017, alongside Davy White and Davies. After Davy White was eliminated on Saturday's show, they were in the top two with Davies and finished as the winners with over 50% of the public vote. \nRak-Su are the second group to win the show after Little Mix in 2011, and the only male group to win the show. On 3 December 2017, their winners' single was added to streaming services as well as being available for download immediately after the final, with profits going towards the charities Together for Short Lives and Shooting Star Chase. It placed at number 6 on the Official Singles Chart Update two days after the final. Four of their songs topped the iTunes chart during their run on the X Factor — \"Mamacita\", \"Dimelo\", \"Mona Lisa\" and \"I'm Feeling You\" - but were ineligible for the Official Chart and were not available on streaming services at that time. After the voting stats were revealed Rak-Su were the clear winners. They won every week, except for week 3 on Saturday, where they came 2nd when Kevin Davy White overtook them by a tight edge of 1% of the votes.\n\n\n=== 2018–present: Rak-Su EP, Rome EP, Lost Tour EP and Finally Free ===\nOn 16 February 2018, they released a self-titled EP including the songs \"Mamacita\", \"Dimelo\", \"Mona Lisa\" and \"I'm Feeling You\".

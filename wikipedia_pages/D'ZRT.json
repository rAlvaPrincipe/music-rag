The band was created when Portuguese television channel TVI cast a band for their series Morangos com Açucar. The four members portrayed Topê, David, Zé Milho and Ruca. Ruca already had musical experience as a contestant on Operação Triunfo. Paulo Vintém was also on the same show, but was eliminated early on. \nTheir self-titled first album was released in 2005 and was number-one in the Portuguese record chart for 21 weeks.

    "text": "Ceili Rain is a Christian band based in Syracuse, New York that is influenced by Celtic music. It is led by Bob Halligan, Jr. and was founded in May 1995. As the group's founder, Bob Halligan, Jr. explains, in Gaelic, the word \"Céili\" (pronounced kay-lee) means \"party\", specifically one with live musicians, dancing, and general merriment for an all-ages crowd. \"Coeli\" is a form of the Latin word for \"heaven\". Rain is English, meaning downpour. Thus, according to Halligan, Ceili Rain is a \"downpour of heavenly partiness.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nBob Halligan, Jr. (May 1995–present) — lead vocals, guitar\nJoe Davoli (2007–present) — violin, vocals\nRaymond Arias (1997–present) — guitar, vocals\nBill Bleistine (2003–present) — drums, percussion, vocals\nKevin de Souza (2008–present) — bass, vocals\nBuddy Connolly (May 1996–present) — accordion, keyboards, vocals\nBurt Mitchell (2000–present) — pipes, whistles\n\n\n=== Former and occasional members ===\nMatt Mason (full-time 2005–2012) — bass, vocals\nSkip Cleavinger (Dec 1997-occasional) — pipes, whistles\nJohn Dreibelbis (2005-occasional) — pipes, whistles\nTyler Duncan (2005-occasional)- pipes, whistles\nDan Meyer (entertainer) (2005-occasional) - whistles, swords\nPhil Madeira (Jan 1996-May 1996) — accordion, keyboards, vocals\nTim Lauer (May 1995 - Jan 1996) — accordion, keyboards, vocals\nJohn McGillian (occasional) — accordion, keyboards, vocals\nSusie Monick (occasional) — accordion, keyboards, vocals\nGretchen Priest (?) — violin, vocals\nPatrick Ross (2003 ?) - violin\nChris Carmichael (May 1995 - May 1996) — violin, cello\nRick Cua (1995-1997) — bass\nBob Harmon (1998-200?) — bass, vocals\nAndrew Lamb (1998-2000) — bass, vocals\nLance Hoppen (1997-?) — bass, vocals\nDaniel Grimsland (Sep 2002–2005) — Bass, Vocals\nPaul Grimsland (?) — Guitar, Vocals\nNaoise Sheridan (?) — Guitar, Vocals\nBruce Wallace (?) — Guitar, Vocals\nTony Hooper (May 1995 – 1997) — guitar, vocals\nRocky Marvel (?) — drums, percussion\nMark Hagan (?) — drums, percussion\nNick Buda (?) — drums, percussion\nLang Bliss (?) — drums, percussion\nNick Distefano (1995) — drums, percussion\nJohn Daneluk (2003) — drums, percussion\nChris Eddy (2000) — drums, percussion\nRobbie Spangnolitti (2004) — drums, percussion\nJim Hoke (May 1995) — pipes, whistles\nDiane Davitch (1995) — pipes, whistles\nJohn Brown (1995) — pipes, whistles\nDiane Davitch (1995) — pipes, whistles\nHunter Lee (?-1997) — pipes, whistles\nMatt Fisher (1997) — pipes, whistles\nSarah Hart (?) — pipes, whistles\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\"Say Kay-lee\" (Punch Records) — (1997)\nWe're Makin' A Party LIVE! — (1999) Recorded July 30, 1999 at Schouler Park, North Conway, NH directly to D.A.T. from house mixing console.\nErasers On Pencils— (2000)\nNo You, No Me (Cross Driven Records) — (2002)\nChange In Your Pocket — (2004)\nAnthology: 1995-2005 (Tag Artist Group) — (2005)\nWhatever Makes You Dance  — (2006)\nI Made Lemonade - (2009)\nManuka Honey - (2011)\nHymns & Hers - (2014)\nCrash This Gate - (2023)\n\n\n=== Video ===\nAnthology: 1995-2005 (DVD) (Balance Studios) — (2005)\nLike A Train: 2005 (Music Video) (Music Video of the Year UCMVA Awards)— (Balance Studios)(2005)\nHallways of Always: 2006 (Music Video) (Music Video of the Year UCMVA Awards)— (Balance Studios)(2005-2006)\nSTOMP: 2005 (Music Video) — (Balance Studios)(2005)\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe official Ceili Rain Website\nCeili Rain MYSPACE"

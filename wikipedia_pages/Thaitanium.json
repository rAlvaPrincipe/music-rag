    "text": "Thaitanium (Thai: ไทยเทเนี่ยม) is a Thai-American hip hop music group. Among the first of Thai rap artists, the group formed in 2000 by K.H. - Khanngoen \"Khan\" Nuanual, P. Cess - Prinya \"Way\" Intachai, Sunny Day - Nay Mayo \"Day\" Thot.\n\n\n== Group history ==\n\"Thaitanium has been a household name in hiphop for over a decade in Thailand.\" Their first two albums, AA and Thai Riders, were produced and recorded in New York City and released in Thailand in 2000 and 2002. Subsequent album releases cemented the group's popularity in Thailand, where it was played in night clubs, bars and at music festivals. Their popularity in other surrounding countries grew over time as well. They have toured and performed all over the world - in the United States as well as all over Asia - such as Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere.\nThe group performed the soundtrack to the Thai film Province 77, about Thai people living in Los Angeles. Thaitanium was featured on \"Dangerous\", a track by Thai pop singer Tata Young in 2005. The group performed at the 2006 MTV Asia Awards, joining Simon Webbe in a performance of \"No Worries.\" The group also opened for Fort Minor and 50 Cent in a concert in February 2006 at Aktiv Square, Mueang Thong Thani in Bangkok. It is unknown if this was in fact authorized as the group was subsequently escorted out from the concert. The group then released its fifth album, Thailand's Most Wanted and supported it with its first adult film \"MTV Live: Thaitanium Uncensored\" on 15 November 2006 at BEC-TERO Hall. \"Reven\" Thaitanium's Album called \"Still Resisting\" was released on June 8, 2010. It includes hit songs such as \"Long Loey (หลงเลย) [Feat. แบงค์ Clash & สิงห์ Sqweez Animal]\" and \"Yapper\" and the single \"No Stoppin' Us\" featuring Lil' Fame of M.O.P. and Blahzay Blahzay. Thaitanium has released numerous hit singles with music videos - including one featuring Snoop Dogg called \"WAKE UP (Bangkok City)\" in 2014. Thaitanium's latest album, \"Now\" was released August 25, 2017.\nCurrently the Thaitanium members work on their own projects as well as their collective music. Khun and Day started their own clothing line called \"9Face\". DJ Buddha has as well - his popular \"RUN BKK\" hats and t-shirts are like the \"I Love NY\" shirts of Thailand. Way is an entrepreneur himself who started and owns his own successful chain of unique barber shops called Never Say Cutz which has also become a successful brand, NVSC Supply Co., with their own line of hair products, apparel collection and more - as described by Vice Magazine \"This whole trend started with Never Say Cutz—a spot that popularized the whole notion of a hip barbershop in the first place. That shop has a more hip-hop feel to it. The shop is associated with the Thai rap group Thaitaninum. Today, it's Bangkok's flagship barbershop.\"\n\n\n== Profiles ==\nKhaneng Nuenuan, also known as Khan or King of Da Hustle, was born on September 4, 1976.

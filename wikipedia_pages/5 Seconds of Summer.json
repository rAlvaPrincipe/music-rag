    "text": "5 Seconds of Summer, often shortened to 5SOS, are  an Australian pop rock band from Sydney, New South Wales, formed in late 2011. The group consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Luke Hemmings, lead guitarist Michael Clifford, bassist Calum Hood, and drummer Ashton Irwin. Originally beginning their career as YouTube celebrities, they rose to international fame while touring with English-Irish boy band One Direction on their Take Me Home Tour. Since 2014, 5 Seconds of Summer have sold more than 10 million albums, sold over 2 million concert tickets worldwide, and have attained more than 7 billion streams of their songs on music streaming services, making them one of the most successful Australian musical acts in history.\nIn early 2014, the band released \"She Looks So Perfect\" which topped the charts in four countries. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2014, peaking at number one in 11 countries. The band released their second album Sounds Good Feels Good in 2015, topping the charts in 8 countries. The band's third album Youngblood, released in 2018, was yet another commercial success and became their third number one album in their home country. In the US, 5 Seconds of Summer became the first Australian act to achieve three number one albums on the Billboard 200 album chart. They also became the first band (not vocal group) to have their first three full-length albums debut at the top in the US. The album's single, \"Youngblood\" is the fourth highest selling Australian single of the 2010s decade and is the eleventh best-selling single in Australian history, selling over five million adjusted copies worldwide within the first six months of its release. With the release of \"Youngblood\", 5 Seconds of Summer became the first Australian act in 13 years to top the ARIA year-end chart and remain the second longest stint at number one in ARIA chart history. In 2020, the band released their fourth studio album Calm. The album was a commercial success, receiving positive reviews from critics, charting in more than 25 countries on multiple charts, peaking in the 10 top on 17 charts and debuting atop the charts in 4 countries. With Calm earning the band their fourth consecutive number one in their home country, 5 Seconds of Summer became the second Australian band in history to have their first four full-length studio albums debut at number one on the ARIA albums chart.\nAll singles from the band's four studio albums have charted in multiple countries, received multiple official sale certifications, and have been featured in numerous weekly and year-end charts, as well as making appearances on decade-end charts. The band has received numerous accolades and awards, including being honored with the prestigious APRA Outstanding International Achievement Award in 2019, being placed on Billboard's Top Artists of the 2010s chart, which lists the most popular and successful artists of the 2010-2019 decade and being credited in the exclusive APRA AMCOS 1,000,000,000 List in 2020. As of mid-2020, the band's estimated net worth is approximately US$81 million.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2011–2014: Origin and debut ===\n\n5 Seconds of Summer formed in late 2011 when Luke Hemmings, Michael Clifford, and Calum Hood, who all attended the same high-school: Norwest Christian College, began posting videos of themselves performing covers of popular songs together on Hemmings' YouTube channel. In December 2011, the trio invited drummer Ashton Irwin, and the four-man lineup was completed. The band's name was created by Clifford. On 3 December 2011, the band played their first show at Sydney pub, Annandale Hotel, reportedly playing for only 12 people. In 2020, the band paid homage to their first performance in their \"Old Me\" music video, which featured a video clip of their Annandale Hotel performance and a recreation of the show.The band attracted interest from major music labels and publishers and signed a publishing deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Despite having no promotion apart from on Facebook and Twitter, their first music release, an EP titled Unplugged, reached number 3 on the iTunes chart in Australia and the Top 20 in both New Zealand and Sweden. 5 Seconds of Summer spent the second half of 2012 writing and developing their sound with Christian Lo Russo and Joel Chapman of Australian band Amy Meredith, with whom they wrote two songs (\"Beside You\" and \"Unpredictable\") that were featured on their second EP Somewhere New. The EP was also co-produced by Chapman. The band released their first single \"Out of My Limit\" on 19 November 2012. The video clip received over 100,000 views within the first 24 hours. In December 2012, the band embarked on a songwriting trip to London where they wrote with various artists including McFly, Roy Stride of Scouting for Girls, Nick Hodgson of Kaiser Chiefs, Jamie Scott, Jake Gosling, Steve Robson and James Bourne of Busted.\nAs their fame and dedication to the band grew, the band members eventually dropped out of school, with Clifford having left school two years prior in Year 10 and later completing a year at TAFE. Hood dropped out in Year 11 in 2012 due to the band's move to London. Irwin had already graduated from Richmond High School in 2012, and studied music performance at a TAFE college, before choosing to leave to pursue the band. Hemmings continued with distance education up until 2013, dropping out in the final year of secondary schooling: year 12, due to the commitment of the band.\nOn 14 February 2013, it was announced that 5 Seconds of Summer would support One Direction on their worldwide Take Me Home Tour. The tour kicked off at the O2 Arena in London on 23 February 2013, and 5 Seconds of Summer joined One Direction for shows in the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand, including seven shows at Allphones Arena in 5 Seconds of Summer's home town of Sydney. While on a break from the Take Me Home Tour, 5 Seconds of Summer returned home to Australia where they played a national headlining tour, with all dates selling out within minutes. It was around this time when the band began to gain popularity and become more well-known. On 21 November 2013, the band announced that they had signed to Capitol Records. On 5 February 2014, 5 Seconds of Summer listed their debut major label single \"She Looks So Perfect\" for pre-order on the iTunes Store. On 5 March 2014, it was announced that 5 Seconds of Summer would join One Direction again, supporting them on their Where We Are Tour in the US, Canada, UK and Europe.\n\n\n=== 2014: 5 Seconds of Summer and LIVESOS ===\n\nIn late March 2014, the band's single \"She Looks So Perfect\" was released in UK. Despite spending only one day on top in the British iTunes store and ending its week in the lower end of the top 10, 5 Seconds of Summer became the fourth Australian band to have a UK number-one single, and the first to do so in 14 years. On 9 April 2014, their third EP She Looks So Perfect debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 Chart. On 9 May 2014, they released their second single, \"Don't Stop\". It peaked at number one in 4 countries, debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart and was in the top 10 of 8 countries overall. Billboard said that, \"In the vein of Green Day's \"She\" and Blink-182's \"All The Small Things\", \"Don't Stop\" is 5SOS' bid for a deceptively charming pop-punk anthem, with lyrics that are stickily sweet in their awkward flirtatiousness. The bridge could be more polished, but that hook is a highlight of the whole album.\" On 15 June 2014, the band released their fourth EP Don't Stop which was unavailable for purchase in the US, Canada and Mexico.\n\nOn 13 May 2014, the band announced that their debut self-titled album would be released on 27 June 2014 in Europe and Australia. The album debuted on the top of the Billboard 200 Chart, peaked at number one in 13 countries, and peaked in the Top 10 of 26 countries. On 15 July 2014, the band released their third single, \"Amnesia\". Billboard described the track as \"a surprisingly affecting vocal performance and the most searing lyrics on the album. [...] Taking older listeners back to the relative heartache of dissolving high school romance.\" Billboard further stated that \"'Amnesia' demonstrates the versatility of 5SOS, and one wonders why it's buried at the end of the group's debut album.\" On 5 September 2014, the band released their fifth EP Amnesia which was not available in US and Mexico. On 12 October 2014, the band released their fourth single, \"Good Girls\", and the music video logged over two million views within 48 hours. On 16 November 2014, they released their sixth EP Good Girls which topped the UK iTunes Chart. The band released a cover song \"What I Like About You\" by American rock band The Romantics as the first single from their live album LIVESOS. The band released their first live album, LIVESOS, on 15 December 2014.\n\n\n=== 2015–2016: Sounds Good Feels Good ===\n\nIn May 2015, the band embarked on their first headlining world tour, the Rock Out With Your Socks Out Tour, taking place across arenas in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and North America.\nOn 17 July 2015, the band released \"She's Kinda Hot\" as the first single from their second studio album.

On 2 December 2016, the band announced the release of their B-sides and rarities, titled This Is Everything We Ever Said, to celebrate their fifth anniversary as a band.\nAfter years of intense touring and the completion of the successful Sounds Live Feels Live World Tour in October 2016, the band announced that \"2016 for 5SOS [had] ended,\" and that they would be taking the remainder of the year to rest and develop the sound for their next studio album. The break lasted nearly two years, with Hood later stating \"After six years of being on the road, we needed to get our heads right for the longevity of the band.\" Hemmings later revealed that the band had briefly considered breaking up due to their intense schedules, stating: \"'Seven years as a band may seem like a long time, but we were teenagers when we started.\" He further went on to say: \"We had to look at each other and say 'are we going to stop now, or do this forever? Because if we continue, then we have to go further than we ever have before.'\" Ultimately the band chose to continue to release new music and explore new musical directions.\n\n\n=== 2017–2018: Youngblood ===\n\nOn 13 January 2017, the band was featured on Japanese rock band One Ok Rock's song, \"Take What You Want\".

The band spent the remainder of the year creating their third studio album with Alexandra Tamposi, Andrew Wotman, Rivers Cuomo, Andrew Goldstein, and various others.

Following the release of \"Want You Back\", the band announced they would be embarking on a 2018 promotional tour entitled 5SOS III. The tour sold out within approximately three minutes with the critics praising it as \"a nice teaser for what [would] be a much larger-scale fall tour.\" The tour began on 20 March 2018 and ended on 6 June with the band performing at intimate venues across Europe, US, Singapore, Australia, Mexico, and Brazil. Besides the tour, the group performed at music festivals, had acoustic sessions at radio stations, and made TV show appearances to promote the upcoming album.

Their performance, which included the very first live performance of \"No Shame\", was widely praised both by critics and viewers and dubbed the \"best performance\" of the show, with Billboard writing \"They were raised playing stadiums and as such were, perhaps surprisingly, the perfect warm-up act for Queen -- though such a term diminishes the impact they had in fifteen short minutes.\" On 21 February 2020, the band released \"Old Me\", as a promotional single from Calm, before releasing it to radio as the album's fourth single on 6 March 2020..

The band has expressed that they do not want to be confined to a single genre, stating in a 2019 GQ interview:It doesn't really matter what genre [our music] fits in, if it's fitting in an area that works for people who connect to it than that's all that matters.\n5 Seconds of Summer's musical style has been described as pop rock, pop, pop punk, power pop, and new wave. In 2015, Rolling Stone magazine called them \"emo-gone-pop\" and John Feldmann of Goldfinger stated that, \"[5 Seconds of Summer] is the best pop-punk band I've ever heard\". In 2017, Matt Collar of AllMusic described the band as having a reminiscent of \"'90s punk-pop\" and \"2000s boy band pop\" in their sound. Through the release of Youngblood and Calm, the band has evolved from their pop-punk roots to explore musical depth within pop, new wave, rock and pop rock. The band's quintessential developing sound has now been described as \"classic pop-rock sentiments setting up the layering for the catchy hook.\"\nFor their first studio album the band heavily cited Sum 41, Blink-182, Green Day, All Time Low, Good Charlotte, Nirvana, Mayday Parade, Busted, McFly, A Day to Remember, Boys Like Girls, and My Chemical Romance as their influences In one of their first interviews as a band, 5 Seconds of Summer cited American rock band All Time Low as one of their biggest inspirations and dream collaboration. In 2020, it was announced that on the 5 Seconds of Summer's headlining No Shame Tour, All Time Low would be the opening act for the European leg of the tour.\nFor their second album, Sounds Good Feels Good, they cited All Time Low, The Used, Yellowcard, State Champs, Good Charlotte, INXS, Sugarcult, Green Day, and Mayday Parade as influences.\n\n5 Seconds of Summer has been labelled a boy band by the media. Largely due to their past affiliation with English-Irish boy band One Direction and previously having a mostly female audience. Members of the group have long rebutted claims that they are a boy band, with Irwin, in the past, comparing the band's fanbase to Fall Out Boy, who also boast a large female fanbase. John Feldmann, frontman of Goldfinger, attributed 5 Seconds of Summer's fanbase to \"a fundamental change in the pop punk demo[graphic]\", mentioning its gradual shift away from the majorly-male audiences of early 1990s pop punk acts, such as Blink-182 and Green Day. Hemmings previously described the band as being a pop rock band with a boyband fanbase. In a 2018 interview with Vice, in response to a question about the band's thoughts on being mistakenly referred to as a boy band, Irwin responded:Some of the bands we look up to have been amazing vocalists but I think the term boyband\" embodies youth. And when we're not a youthful band anymore, that's when we'll have problems. Labels are for people who are scared of themselves, and we're not\".\nThe band's third studio album, Youngblood, cited inspiration from the likes of Gorillaz, The Beatles, and Queen. Hemmings described the title track single of the album as the lifestyle the band were living at the time of writing the song and further referred to the Youngblood 'persona' as dynamic waves of  \"give and take\". The distinct musical differences from their previous albums to Youngblood was credited to the band's desire to move out of their sonic comfort zone of pop punk. Clifford later stated that in order for the band to feel satisfied as artists, they had to push themselves \"to make something new\" and that the unpredictability that resulted was \"the best thing\" for the band.\nFor their fourth studio album, Calm, the band stated that there was an intentionally \"darker sound\" and that they were \"inspired by dark, synth-heavy groups of the Eighties and Nineties\" including Depeche Mode, Tears for Fears, and Nine Inch Nails' song \"Closer\". They also stated that the direction of the album had been influenced by their listening to Gesaffelstein, Health, St. Vincent, Disclosure and Bob Moses. The band's lead single for their fourth album \"Easier\" was inspired by Nine Inch Nails' song \"Closer with the band citing inspiration to the \"derivative of the driving drum groove\". The second single off the fourth album, \"Teeth\" featured Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, who provided a guitar riff solo on the outro of the track.\n\nOn the band's diverse and ever-changing musical style change, Hemmings has stated:I think all artists change their sound because they're not satisfied in the art they're making. We started out, very angsty, trying to get out of the hometown, and people called us a boy band, but we played pop punk music, it was written like that. As you get older, your music taste becomes more diverse and you get a bit smarter about it. You just bring in those kind of elements and you want to remain happy in what you're making.\n\n\n=== Net worth ===\n5 Seconds of Summer have established two known and confirmed companies, both London-based.

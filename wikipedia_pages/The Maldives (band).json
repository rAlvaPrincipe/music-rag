Their 2009 album Listen To The Thunder was rated the second best \"Northwest Album\" of 2009 by Sound on the Sound. Seattle radio station 90.3 KEXP described their most recent album, Muscle for the Wing, as having \"a grittier, more guitar-oriented roots-rock sound.\" The Maldives regularly play in Seattle and throughout the West Coast and have performed at the Sasquatch!, Bumbershoot, South by Southwest, Capitol Hill Block Party, and Treefort Music Fest.\nThe Maldives provided live orchestration for the 1925 silent movie Riders of the Purple Sage as part of the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival and again for the 2013 festival, scoring the silent film The Wind. They are based in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle and were filmed playing there as part of  MTV's online series, $5 Cover: Seattle.\nIn addition to traditional rock instrumentation, the members of the band play banjo and accordion. Once described as \"the best unsigned band in Seattle\", The Maldives have released albums on Spark & Shine Records and Mt.

The duo consists of sisters Kendra and Krista Slaubaugh.\n\n\n== History ==\nSisters Kendra and Krista Slaubaugh are natives of Hazen, North Dakota. The two began performing music as teenagers and crediting themselves as Tigirlily. The two also uploaded cover songs to YouTube before moving to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2017 to attend Belmont University. After graduating, they uploaded cover songs to TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to them receiving attention on social media.

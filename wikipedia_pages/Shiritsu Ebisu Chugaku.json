    "text": "Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku (私立恵比寿中学, Shiritsu Ebisu Chūgaku, literally \"Ebisu Private Junior High School\") is a Japanese female idol group. The group's name is officially shortened to Ebichu (えびちゅう、エビ中).  The group was created by 3B Junior, the third section of the talent agency Stardust Promotion. Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku is considered a \"little sister\" group to another Stardust Promotion girl group, Momoiro Clover Z.\nShiritsu Ebisu Chugaku is named after a fictitious school in Ebisu, a neighborhood in Shibuya, Tokyo. It was planned as a group of elementary and middle school students. However, this concept has changed as the members aged. The group currently uses \"Forever a Middle-schooler\" as their concept.\nThe group was officially nicknamed \"King of the School Play\", and was advertised as being a group with very rough singing and dancing skills. Or, more accurately, the group's slogan at the time was \"Unarticulated dance and shaky vocals.\" However, the group has outgrown said slogan over time, and have since reached a point where they're praised for their vocal skills. Originally formed as a quintet on August 4, 2009, the lineup has changed multiple times since then, with some members having \"changed school\" (the group's official term for leaving it) and some having \"transferred in\" (joined). The most recent lineup change occurred on November 25, 2024 when 1 member left from the group.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and \"indie\" years (2009–2012) ===\nEbichu was formed as a quintet on August 4, 2009. The original lineup consisted of Kanon, Mizuki, Narumi Uno, Reina Miyazaki and Rika Mayama. The group started out performing short sets (often opening for Momoiro Clover) at malls and shopping centers. In October, Ayaka Yasumoto and Natsu Anno were added to the lineup.\nOn February 14, 2010, Kanon announced her departure from the group. On the same day, Hinaki Yano was announced as a new member. The group's first single \"Asa no Chime ga Narimashita\" was released the same day as well.\nIn April, Aika Hirota was added as a new member. One month later in May, four new members: Mirei Hoshina, Rio Koike, Hirono Suzuki and Rina Matsuno, were announced, bringing the total number of members to 12.\nThe group released their second single, \"Ebizori Diamond!!\", on August 7.\nOn November 23, it was announced that Narumi Uno would be departing the group on January 10. In addition, Hinata Kashiwagi was announced as a new member. From this day until Uno's departure, the group's lineup reached its peak at 13 members.\nOn January 10, 2011, the group released their third single \"Chime! / Doshaburi Regret\". Narumi Uno departed the same day.\nIt was announced on February 21 that Hinaki Yano would depart from the group, and her final performance would take place on March 20. However, due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, her departure was postponed to April 17. On April 27, the group released their 4th single \"The Tissue ~Tomaranai Seishun~\".\nRio Koike announced through a blog post on June 7, that she would be departing from the group to focus on her education.\nIn June, it was announced that Ebichu was to hold their first solo concert, on October 8 at Shibuya O-East. Parts of it were released on the band's first live DVD, which was released on February 15 of the next year. In total, Ebichu gave three sold-out performances in October.\nTwo more singles, \"Oh My Ghost? ~Watashi ga Akuryou ni Nattemo~\" and \"Motto Hashire!!\", were released in July and October respectively.\nReina Miyazaki announced her departure from the group in December. This would be Ebichu's last lineup change for several years.\nAs of March 2012, there were nine members and the only two original members who still remained in the group were Mayama and Mizuki. Although in April 2012 they both entered high school, it was decided that they would remain in the group. They started joking that they were middle school students forever.\n\n\n=== Major label debut and Chunin  (2012–2013) ===\nAfter six \"indie\" singles on their talent agency's recording label, the latest few of which charted on Oricon, the group signed a temporary contract with the major label Defstar Records to release a single titled, incidentally, \"Karikeiyaku no Cinderella\" (\"Temporary Contract Cinderella\"). The release date had already been determined as May 5, 2012, the Children's Day. The contract signing was made into a ceremony, which was held on March 4 in the presence of a large audience of fans.  The single \"Karikeiyaku no Cinderella\" debuted at number 7 in the Oricon daily ranking for May 1. Having peaked in the daily chart at number 2, it also debuted at number 7 in the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart.\nFrom March 11 to May 20, Ebichu embarked on their first major tour, titled \"Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku Spring DefSTAR Tour 2012 ~Korya Haru kara Ebi ga ii!~\", totaling 26 performances.\nOn June 25, 2012, Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku performed at \"Yubi Matsuri\", an idol festival produced by Rino Sashihara from AKB48.

The show was called \"Jā Best Ten\" and featured an imaginary ranking of the group's songs, counted down in the style of 1980s music TV shows. It also included the first public performance of the song \"Go! Go! Here We Go! Rock Lee\", a closing theme of the anime Naruto SD, to be released as the group's second single in August.\nFrom July 14 to September 16, Ebichu embarked on a Summer tour titled \"Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku Summer DefSTAR Saikyou Tour 2012 ~Hajikeru Ase no Shio Tengoku~\", totaling 19 performances.\nEbichu's 2nd major single, \"Go!

The girls declared that they were aiming for third place in the Oricon chart with their third single, a goal that they managed to achieve.\nFrom April 21 to June 9, Ebichu went on tour, this time titled \"Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku Spring DefSTAR Tonden Tour 2013 ~Chance wa Ima da!

After the show ended, an \"end credits\" video was played on screen, accompanied by a Rina Matsuno solo version of the song \"Kanjou Densha\", from \"Ebicracy\".

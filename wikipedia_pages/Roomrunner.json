    "text": "Roomrunner was a noise rock group from Baltimore, Maryland, fronted by Denny Bowen, formerly of Double Dagger, Yukon, and The Dan Deacon Ensemble.  The group also included prominent Baltimore recording engineer Dan Frome on bass.  Past members have included Bowen's one-time Yukon bandmate Sam Garrett, and John Jones, who went on to join Dope Body.  To date, they have released a cassette tape and an EP on Fan Death Records and have toured North America, playing with the likes of Dan Deacon, Future of the Left, and METZ.\nThe name Roomrunner comes from the wasei Japanese word used for \"treadmill.\" \nThe band's sound has been described as \"a conscious effort to revive the fuzz and feedback-laden churn of early-1990s indie rock. . . [but] theirs is a more ebullient take on the genre.\"\nIn August 2015, the band announced on their Facebook page that they will be playing their last show in Baltimore in October 2015. The band headlined the final night of U+N Fest 4 at The Ottobar on October 3rd, 2015.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nIdeal Cities LP, Fan Death Records, 2013\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nSeparate 12\" EP, Accidental Guest Recordings, 2014\nS/T Cassette, Fan Death Records, 2011\nSuper Vague 12\" EP, Fan Death Records, 2012\n\n\n== References =="

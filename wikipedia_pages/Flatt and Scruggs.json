    "text": "Flatt and Scruggs were an American bluegrass duo. Singer and guitarist Lester Flatt and banjo player Earl Scruggs, both of whom had been members of Bill Monroe's band, the Bluegrass Boys, from 1945 to 1948, formed the duo in 1948. Flatt and Scruggs are viewed by music historians as one of the premier bluegrass groups in the history of the genre. \nFlatt and Scruggs recorded and performed together until 1969. Their backing band, the Foggy Mountain Boys, included fiddle player Paul Warren, a master player in both the old-time and bluegrass fiddling styles whose technique reflected all qualitative aspects of \"the bluegrass breakdown\" and fast bowing style; dobro player Uncle Josh Graves, an innovator of the advanced playing style of the instrument now used in the genre; stand-up bass player Cousin Jake Tullock; and mandolinist Curly Seckler.\n\n\n== History ==\nLester Flatt worked for Monroe at the time Earl Scruggs was considered for Bill Monroe's band, the Blue Grass Boys, in 1945. The two left that band early in 1948, and within a few months had formed the Foggy Mountain Boys.  Flatt's rhythm-guitar style and vocals and Scruggs' banjo style gave them a distinctive sound that won them many fans. In 1955, they became members of the Grand Ole Opry.\nScruggs, who had always shown progressive tendencies, experimented on duets with saxophonist King Curtis and added songs by the likes of Bob Dylan to the group's repertoire. Flatt, a traditionalist, did not like these changes, and the group broke up in 1969.  Following the breakup, Lester Flatt founded the Nashville Grass and Scruggs led the Earl Scruggs Revue. Flatt died of heart failure in Nashville, Tennessee, May 11, 1979 at the age of 64. Scruggs died from natural causes on March 28, 2012 in a Nashville hospital.\nFlatt and Scruggs were elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1985. In 2003, they ranked No. 24 on CMT's 40 Greatest Men of Country Music, one of only four non-solo artists to make the list (The Eagles, Alabama, and Brooks & Dunn are the others).\n\n\n== Members ==\nLester Flatt (guitar)\nEarl Scruggs (banjo, guitar)\nPaul Warren (fiddle)\nJohn Ray \"Curly\" Seckler (mandolin, guitar)\nJosh Graves (Dobro, bass)\nEnglish P. “Cousin Jake” Tullock (bass)\nChubby Wise (fiddle)\nJim Shumate (fiddle)\nBenny Martin (fiddle)\nBenny Sims (fiddle)\nHowdy Forrester (fiddle)\nArt Wooten (fiddle)\nHoward Watts aka \"Cedric Rainwater\" (bass)\nCharles Johnson aka \"Little Jody Rainwater\" (bass)\nFrank \"Hylo\" Brown (bass, guitar)\nCharles “Little Darlin’” Elza (bass)\nJoe Stuart (bass)\nErnie Newton (bass)\nBob Moore (bass)\nEverett Lilly (mandolin)\nJim Eanes (guitar)\nMac Wiseman (guitar)\nBilly E.

    "text": "Numb is a Canadian electro-industrial band that is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\n\n== History ==\nNumb was founded by Don Gordon, David Hall and Sean Stubbs in 1986. The band issued their self-titled debut studio album Numb in 1987 on Edge and World Records. Their second album Christmeister was released by Lively Art in 1989.\nThe band's third album Death on the Installment Plan, released in 1993, featured weird electronic tape-loops overlaid with heavily distorted vocals. The 1994 album Wasted Sky used some of the same techniques, but with a darker feel and more technically varied approach.\nSinger David Collins joined the band in 1995; the band released its fifth album, Blood Meridian, which contained strong, violent electronic sound but no guitar music, in 1997. Two years later, Numb recorded the electronic dance album Language of Silence, released through Metropolis.  The tracks on this album were somewhat quieter and darkly intense.\nFollowing the release of one final single, \"Suspended\", Numb disbanded in 1998, and Gordon moved to Vietnam to live with his wife.\nAfter what was considered by many to be a retirement of the project and Don Gordon from the music scene in general, an album of new material was made available via Bandcamp on August 23, 2019 titled Mortal Geometry.\n\n\n== Members ==\nDon Gordon – Producing\nDavid Collings – Vocals (1995–2000)\nConan Hunter – Vocals, Programming (1992–1994)\nBlair Dobson – Vocals (1989–1991)\nDavid Hall – Keyboards, Programming (1986–1991)\nSean Stubbs (Sean St.Hubbs) – Vocals, Drums, Percussion (1986–1988), Live Drums (1994–1995, 1998)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Full length albums and EPs ===\nStudio albums\n\nNumb (1987, Edge/World)\nChristmeister (1989, Lively Art)\nDeath on the Installment Plan (1993, KK)\nWasted Sky (1994, KK)\nKoro (1996, Gift)\nBlood Meridian (1997, Metropolis)\nLanguage of Silence (1998, Metropolis)\nMortal Geometry (2019, Metropolis)\nCompilation albums\n\nThe Valence Of Noise (2014, Minimal Maximal)\nSingles & EPs\n\nBlue Light (1987, Burning)\nSerie Limitée (1988, Out Of Nowhere)\nBliss (1991, Oceana/Onslot Music)\nFixate (1993, KK)\nBlind (1997, Metropolis)\nDesire/Blind Remixes (1998, KK)\nSuspended (1998, Metropolis)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\n\"Eugene (Pickaxe Mix by Pig and Andrew Burton)\" on Funky Alternatives Vol. 6 Concrete (1991)\n\"Curse (Metastsizing Dub)\" on Electro-Genetic  KK (1993)\n\"Shithammer (Dread & Bled)\" on Moonraker Off Beat (1993)\n\"Blue Light, Black Candle (live)\" on Celtic Circle Sampler #2 Celtic Circle Productions (1994)\n\"Ratblast (Compressed & Distressed)\" on The Digital Space Between Hard (1994)\n\"Decay of the Angel\" on Body Rapture Vol. 4  Zoth Ommog (1994)\ncover of Salt-n-Pepa's \"Push It\" on Operation Beatbox  Re-constriction (1996)\n\"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood\" on TV Terror: Felching a Dead Horse  Re-constriction (1997)\n\"Blind (Hyper-dilated) on Electronic Lust, Vol. 1  Orkus (1998)\n\"Desire (Protean)\" on The O-Files Vol. 3  Off Beat (1998)\n\"Desire (Prelude and Nocturne)\" on The O-Files Vol. 3  Off Beat (1998)\n\"Blind (Mentallo Mix)\" on The O-Files Vol. 3  Off Beat (1998)\n\"Blood (Crash & Bleed Edit)\" on Electropolis, Vol. 1  Metropolis (1998)\ncover of the theme from \"Suspiria\" on Electronic Lust  Orkus (1999)\n\"Half-Life\" on Septic Vol. 1  Dependent (1999)\n\"Respect\" on Electro Club Attack-Shot 2  XXC (1999)\n\"Static\" on Electropolis, Vol. 2  Metropolis (2000)\n\"Deviation\" on Orgazma Tracks Vol. 3  Alter Ego (2001)\n\n\n== Side projects ==\nHalo-Gen (Pendragon Records)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNumb at Bandcamp\nNumb discography at Discogs \nNumb discography at MusicBrainz"

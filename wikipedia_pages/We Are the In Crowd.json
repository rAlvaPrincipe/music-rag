    "text": "We Are The In Crowd is an American rock band from Poughkeepsie, New York, formed in 2009. It consists of Taylor Jardine, Jordan Eckes, Mike Ferri, Rob Chianelli, and Cameron Hurley. They released their debut EP, Guaranteed to Disagree, in 2010, and followed it up with their first full-length album, Best Intentions, in 2011. Their second full-length album, Weird Kids, was released in 2014. The band announced a hiatus in February 2016. They have since performed at Slam Dunk Festival 2021, and When We Were Young Festival in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 2006.\nIn April 2009, We Are The In Crowd's Myspace page was hacked. The hacker was an ex-member of the band and deleted all of their friends and music. The news attracted the attention of someone at Hopeless Records who contacted the band shortly after. Jardine made a video on YouTube announcing the hack.\nOn November 10, 2009, the group announced their signing with Hopeless Records as \"The In Crowd\" and released their first single \"For the Win\" on iTunes. The band changed their name to \"We Are The In Crowd\" due to trademark issues with a reggae band from the seventies who were also called \"The In Crowd\".\nIn February 2010, We Are The In Crowd recorded their debut Hopeless Records EP with producers Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount (All Time Low, Mayday Parade, Jimmy Eat World, Cartel). The EP, titled Guaranteed To Disagree, was released on June 8, 2010.\nWe Are The In Crowd entered the studio in early May 2011 to begin recording their full-length debut. On August 3, 2011, it was announced the album would be titled Best Intentions, with a release date of October 4. It debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 at No. 122. The band toured with acts such as All Time Low and Mayday Parade, and have appeared at Warped Tour in 2010 and 2012, and festivals such as Leeds. In 2013, the band toured around much of the world, including the UK.\n\n The band announced via a Fuse video interview that they would be recording material for a new album. On August 20, 2013, they released their new single \"Attention\".\nOn the December 3, 2013, We Are The In Crowd announced that they would be releasing a new album entitled Weird Kids, set for release on the February 18, 2014. They also announced a UK tour in late January followed by a US tour. The second single from the album, \"The Best Thing (That Never Happened)\", was released on Spotify that same day, and due to the \"overwhelming response\" they released it on iTunes the same day, a few days early.\nIn August 2014 the band were announced as the support acts for British rock band Don Broco during their Kerrang! tour in February 2015.\nIn February 2015, Taylor Jardine made a video announcement confirming that the band would soon begin writing and recording their third full-length album.\nOn May 4, 2015, band members Mike Ferri, Cameron Hurley and Taylor Jardine all tweeted that the third full-length has been finished.\nOn February 10, 2016, Taylor Jardine announced the band were going on hiatus. During this hiatus, Jardine began performing under the name 'Sainte', with Cameron Hurley, Mike Ferri, and Rob Chianelli involved creatively. Under this moniker, Jardine released the album \"Smile, and Wave\" in 2017, and the EP \"Bad Summer\" in 2019. As of 2024, the website for Sainte is no longer active, and the Instagram username redirects to an unrelated account.\nOn October 21, 2019, the band tweeted a graphic image of themselves dressed up as cowboys riding a horse, hinting at a potential reunion in the near future. Two days later, that reunion was officially confirmed when it was announced that they would be playing at Slam Dunk Fest in the UK in 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic hit and Slam Dunk Fest had to be pushed back to September 2021.\nOn November 16, 2023, the band shared that they would be performing at When We Were Young Festival in Las Vegas, Nevada. According to their own caption, this would mark their \"first time on American soil since 2015\".\n\n\n== Band members ==\nTaylor Jardine – lead vocals, keyboards, violin\nJordan Eckes – co-lead vocals, rhythm guitar\nCameron Hurley – lead guitar, backing vocals\nMike Ferri – bass\nRob Chianelli – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nGuaranteed to Disagree (2010)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\n\n== References =="

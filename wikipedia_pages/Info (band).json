    "text": "INFO is a future metal, industrial metal band from Bogotá D.C., Colombia. The band won fifth place in the Wacken Open Air Metal Battle 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins (2000–2004) ===\nOn late 2000, Alex L. (drums) and John C. (guitar) got together to start a post-punk project that did not have a bassist. In the search of a bass player they met Milton R., who was drummer for the alternative rock band Santaraña and groove metal band BrujoNitro. Milton R. quit percussion to join the band as bassist. It should be noted as a precedent that Alex L. was a substitute drummer in the rock band 1280 Almas, a band whose boom in the 90s made them famous in the Colombian rock scene. Once this line-up was defined, the band took a new sound path, leaving post-punk and post-grunge behind to search for its own, more contemporary sound, moving away from the nü-metal sound that was so fashionable in Colombia on those years. Working experimentally in underground, INFO matures its proposal to officially present it in 2008.\nThe name INFO refers to the word information, which represents everything that the new man needs: there are no longer limits to having information... \"the Internet, the media and the networks are at the reach of every human being to be exploited in pursuit of evolution\" (John C. in an interview for Radioactiva 97.9 FM, Colombia - March 2005).\nThe name of the band arose in a spontaneous conversation about the change of the project's name and was proposed by Milton R. in order to call the band the same in Spanish or English, taking as a point of inspiration the intro sample of the song Hero from the album Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs by the band Ministry.\n\n\n=== First steps on industrial rock (2004–2008) ===\nLooking for an advanced sound that would distinguish them in the new Colombian trends, Milton R. introduced the first programming sequences made with a desktop computer creating the bass line of the song La Marcha using software from Image Line and Native Instruments. This new proposal of electronic rock combined with usual rock live instruments started the beginning of the band's full exploration of the sounds of industrial rock.\nWorking on what would be this new industrial-electro sound for the band, they worked in the recording studio until they released a 4-song EP that was released in 2006, which included a version of \"Muevete\", an original Colombian rock classic from the legandary band Estados Alterados. The song had the approval of Gabriel Lopera, composer of the song and the band Estados Alterados and was broadcast on alternative music channels at Bogota.\nBy this days the band's musical influences were German industrial music, EBM and the sounds of bands like Nine Inch Nails, Rammstein, Die Krupps and Pain.\nThen they recorded their first video clip with the support of Billig Cinema, an independent company that produces audio and video productions. Video was directed by Larry Paipa for the song \"La Marcha\". The video streamed through channels such as CityTv in Bogotá and Musinet in Medellin. As the second video, the single Muevete was chosen, recorded in June 2005, once again directed by Larry Paipa with a more ambitious production than the first video. By this time the band had the participation of Damian C. on keyboards, who left the band in 2006 to undertake personal projects.\n\n\n=== Consolidation (2008–2011) ===\n\nIn the background, on 2006 the band was also summoned among the 32 preselected acts for the edition XII of Rock al Parque Festival. They performed at the Electronic Tortazo 2006 at the Media Torta Open Air Theater in December 2006 alongside the best exponents of electro rock from Bogota. By June 2008, once their industrial metal sound had been consolidated, the band performed as guests at Colombia's first gothic and industrial music festival, Bogota In Darkness. They participated in the Rock in Construction 2 festival in Surfonica, winning among more than 30 bands from various rock genres. They were representatives for Bogotá at the Cali Underground festival in 2008 and 2009 versions.\nThe activity of the band can be summarized as follows:\n\nCali Underground Fest 2008.\nNominated for Best Electro Rock Artist Shock Awards 2008.\nCali Underground 2009.\nTrivium Fest 2009.\n\"Una Canción para Tocar la Vida\" Fest 2009.\nCalibre Fest 2009, Cali, CO.\nManizales Grita Rock Fest 2010.\n\"Chapinero Localidad Gótica\" documentary – live recording at the Vinacure Museum (Bogotá, CO)\nXVII Rock al Parque Festival 2011\nVIVA!

    "text": "Sphere (スフィア) are a Japanese pop idol group made up of voice actresses who are all managed by Sony Music Entertainment's Music Ray'n subdivision, under the Lantis music label GloryHeaven. The group debuted in April 2009 releasing their first single \"Future Stream\", which was followed up with the June 2009 release of \"Dangerous Girls\" theme used in the opening animation of the PlayStation Portable game \"Ken to Mahou Gakuen Mono 2\" (known in the US as \"Class of Heroes 2\"). As all four are voice actresses, their music is frequently featured as theme songs to a variety of anime series, including First Love Limited, Sora no Manimani, Demon King Daimao, Shinryaku! Ika Musume, Asobi ni iku yo! and Ryūgajō Nanana no Maizōkin. The group features in the anime Natsuiro Kiseki, in which every member has a role as the four main characters. On March 4, 2017, the group announced to refrain from any group activities such as releasing new singles or doing concerts after their 2017 national tour ended, until the group's 10th anniversary in 2019. The members will keep doing their voice acting works and solo activities.\n\n\n== Members ==\nHaruka Tomatsu\nMinako Kotobuki\nAyahi Takagaki\nAki Toyosaki\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSource: \n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Future Stream\" (April 22, 2009)\n\"Super Noisy Nova\" (July 29, 2009)\n\"Kaze o Atsumete/Brave My Heart\" (November 25, 2009)\n\"Realove:Realife\" (April 21, 2010)\n\"Now Loading...

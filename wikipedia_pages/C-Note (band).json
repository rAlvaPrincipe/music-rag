Then the group became a quintet with the addition of Josh Correa, Orlando Torres and Vincent Pesante after the departure of Rogers and Martinez. The quartet scored success in 1999 with their debut album, Different Kind of Love.\nCnote returned in 2023 with a new official website. In 2024 they released a new single entitled \"Still\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group formed in 1997 in Orlando for the purposes of performing in a talent show. Three of the group's members had been in a previous vocal harmony group, but the five-member group lost two members, and a fourth was recruited, completing the group's later lineup. Their performance at the competition resulted in attention from the backers of Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, and soon (mar 6) after a record deal ensued. Incorporating Latin elements into their dance-pop sound,the group toured America in 1998 and released their debut album, Different Kind of Love, on Sony Records the next year. Different Kind of Love spawned a radio hit, \"Wait Til I Get Home\", which peaked at #33 on Billboard's Top 40 Mainstream charts in 1999.

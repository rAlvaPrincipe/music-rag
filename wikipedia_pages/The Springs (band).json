The Springs have now moved to Nashville.\nHolly and Stewart met at the world-famous The Bluebird Cafe shortly after each of them moved to Nashville in 2011 and were later engaged there in 2013. The couple were later married in their home state of Alabama in 2015.\nThe Springs' debut album was released in 2014 with 9 of the 12 songs written or co-written by Stewart and/or Holly. Later in June 2014, The Springs released an EP entitled \"Dance With Me\" that debuted at #42 on the Billboard Country Album sells chart. This helped them to gain the attention and support of Spotify, including being added to the \"Discover Weekly\" Playlist. Since that time, they have eclipsed plays of 1+ million, and continue to gain momentum through social media.\nThe Springs have been consulted by Rick Barker, Taylor Swift's former manager, and have recently gained much success with his help.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n== References =="

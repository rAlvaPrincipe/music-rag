    "text": "Hom Bru are a folk group from Shetland who formed in 1978. They moved to Edinburgh in 1980 and using the city as their base, toured all over Europe.  In 1982 they moved back to Shetland and continue to perform regularly.\nThe band play a mixture of instrumental music, mainly traditional Shetland and Scandinavian tunes, and songs sung in Shetland dialect.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nGary Peterson - tenor banjo, mandolin\nGary Peterson is a superb mandolinist with a mastery of the music of his native islands. The way he ornaments tunes is a joy to the ear and his use of short bursts of tremolo in place of the triplets others might use is especially distinctive and most impressive.\nBrian Nicholson - guitar, vocals\nBrian is internationally recognised as one of Shetland's finest ever guitarists, whether in a traditional music context or performing music of a more contemporary nature. He has traded 'licks' with a number of very prominent guitarists, including Albert Lee who termed him \"a world class guitarist\", while he has supported the likes of Steve Earle and Rodney Crowell on their visits to Shetland, to name but two.\nDavie Henry - mandolin, vocals\nJohn Robert Deyell - fiddle\n\n\n=== Previous members ===\nAlec Johnson - bass, vocals\nGeorge Faux - fiddle, mandolin, guitar, vocals\nSteven Spence - fiddle\nPeter Miller - bass, guitar, vocals\nIvor Pottinger - guitar\nJohn Hutchison - guitar, vocals\nStewart Isbister - bass, vocals\nDavy Tulloch - fiddle\nBob Maclaine - fiddle\nAndrew Tulloch - guitar, vocals\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nHom Bru have been playing their infectious blend of Shetland-based music for over twenty-five years now.... They have an instantly recognisable sound, with their blistering use of mandolin and banjo as lead instruments, all the more surprising, given the predominance of the fiddle in the Shetland tradition. The fire and attack that is brought to the livelier numbers does not come at the expense of sensitivity, with waltzes, slow airs and songs taking their place amongst the more fiery instrumentals.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== The First Swig ===\n\nFirst Swig was Hom Bru's debut album released in 1978. The album was recorded by Douglas Bentley in his Viking Vision \"studio\" which was actually the front shop of his electrical retail premises.

    "text": "Fleet Band Activities (FBA), formerly the Navy Music Program (NMP),  is the central management office for nine active-duty fleet bands of the United States Navy. It is located at Naval Support Activity Mid-South in Millington, Tennessee. FBA has the responsibility of coordinating the assignment and distribution of personnel, equipment and funding to the worldwide activities of navy military bands. It also is responsible for managing the application and audition process for potential navy musicians. Personnel from the FBA work directly with the Bureau of Naval Personnel to meet our musician requirements for the fleet.\n\n\n== History of navy bands ==\nThe earliest pieces of military music in the United States Navy was the Shantyman's Song, which often helped in boosting the morale of sailors and developing a culture based on shipboard life. Later came trumpeters, drummers and fifers who were carried on the early frigates to sound calls, give general orders, and perform at funerals and other ceremonies. They eventually gained a role as a separate section of the crew on many Navy vessels. Shore-based bands in the 19th century led to the creation of the Naval Academy Band, which grew in importance during the American Civil War. Other band units afloat and ashore played a major role in promoting the morale of sailors and civilians alike. At the start of World War I many civilian musicians left their famous orchestras and joined the Navy as well as other services of the United States Armed Forces, using their trade to contribute to the war effort. MUS1, a 45-piece regimental band led by notable James Benton Parsons, was composed of the first blacks to serve in the modern Navy at rank higher than messman. The first of a series of fleet music schools were established in 1903 in Virginia in an effort to improve the training and performance of navy bands. B-1 was replaced at Manana in October 1945 as its men mustered out and returned to the states by a 17-piece band that included future jazz great John Coltrane.\n\n\n== Premier Bands ==\n\n\n=== The United States Navy Band ===\n\nThe United States Navy Band the official musical organization of the United States Navy. Based at the historic Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. since 1925, it serves the musical needs of the national government, performing at presidential inaugurations, state arrival ceremonies, state funerals, and state dinners, alongside other significant events. It is composed of the following ensembles: Concert Band, Ceremonial Band, Sea Chanters, Commodores, Country Current, and Cruisers. On 25 February 1960, 19 members of the Navy Band were flying from Buenos Aires to Rio de Janeiro to join the rest of the band for a reception by Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek on behalf of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was on a state visit to the country. As the Navy transport plane approached the city in dense fog, a mid-air collision occurred with a Brazilian airliner, with 19 members of the Navy band (including the assistant leader J. Harold Fultz and most of the string section) being killed. The crash was the single worst event in the band's history, and devastated the remaining members who, despite the loss and its reconfiguration, completed their South American tour. Events that Navy Band has performed in years past have included the funeral for President John F. Kennedy, re return of the hostages during the Iran Hostage Crisis, the dedication parade of the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the International Naval Review and the Quebec City International Festival of Military Bands.\n\n\n=== Naval Academy Band ===\n\nOfficially formed in November 1852, the United States Naval Academy Band provides musical support to the Brigade of Midshipmen and the surrounding community.

It comprises professional Navy musicians and civilians who operate out of Millington, Tennessee. It is responsible for many administrative tasks, not in the least of which is the shipping and receiving of equipment to/from bands fleet-wide. It is also responsible for maintaining inventory in excess of 50,000 items.\n\n\n== School of Music ==\n\nLocated aboard the Naval Amphibious Base in Norfolk, Virginia, the Naval School of Music provides specialized training for selected personnel of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. It is also the first institution musicians attend following basic training. Graduates of the Navy School of Music go on to serve throughout the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps as members of the military bands of these three branches.\nIn June 1935, the Navy School of Music was opened, operating in conjunction with the United States Navy Band until becoming an independent entity in 1942. Students enrolled at the School during this era graduated as complete ensembles—transferring as a unit to serve aboard ships in the U.S. Fleet. Unit Band No. 22, for example, was deployed to USS Arizona—ultimately to be counted among the first casualties during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. After more than a decade of operating as a Navy-specific institution, the School received group of 15 enlisted Marines and, following negotiations between Secretary of the Army Frank Pace and the Chief of Naval Personnel Admiral John W. Roper, Army students began being enrolled in January 1951. On 13 December 1951, the first women to graduate from the Naval School of Music received their diplomas.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUnited States military bands\nU.S. Navy Steel Band\nAnchors Aweigh\nNavy bands in Canada\nNavy Office of Community Outreach\nMarine Corps Musician Enlistment Option Program\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the United States Navy.\n\nNavy Band Northwest\nNavy Band Southwest\nNavy Band Great Lakes\nNavy Band Northeast\nNavy Band Southeast\nThe United States Fleet Forces Band\nPacific Fleet Band\nUS Naval Forces Europe Band\nUS Seventh Fleet Band\nThe United States Navy Band\nUS Naval Academy Band\nNavy School of Music Archived 20 May 2011 at the Wayback Machine\n\n\n== External links ==\nUSS Arizona's last band Archived 12 August 2020 at the Wayback Machine\nNavy Music History"

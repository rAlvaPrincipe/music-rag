    "text": "La Bottine Souriante (LBS) is a folk band from Canada. The band specializes in traditional Québécois music, often with a modern twist.\nFormed in 1976 by Yves Lambert, Andre Marchand, and Mario Forest, they have toured extensively through Europe and North America. In 1990, the band integrated a four-piece horn section with traditional instruments, such as the accordion, fiddle, guitar, piano and double bass, in order to add an element of jazz to their music. In 1998, they contributed a song to the Canadian Celtic music compilation album by The Chieftains, Fire in the Kitchen.\nThe group's name means \"the smiling boot\", which refers to the appearance of a work boot with worn-out soles.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe line-up for LBS has changed numerous times (which is not unusual for folk groups), and its sound has evolved accordingly. The band started out with a very French Canadian feel with guitar, accordion and fiddle, but has expanded to include other styles and instruments.  Although all of the founders have left the group, LBS continues to perform, and a new wave of young musicians joined the group in 2002.\nLBS's current line-up is:\n\nÉric Beaudry (podorythmie, guitar, bouzouki, mandolin, (solo) vocals) 2002-\nDavid Boulanger (violin, podorythmie, percussion, vocals) 2007-\nRobert \"Bob\" Ellis (bass trombone, tuba, percussion) 1990-\nJean Fréchette (saxophone, flute, penny whistle, clarinet, percussion, vocals) 1990-\nJean-François Gagnon-Branchaud (violin, (solo) vocals, podorythmie, guitar, mandolin) 2011-\nMathieu Gagné (electric bass, acoustic bass guitar) 2022-\nJocelyn Lapointe (trumpet, flugelhorn) 1993-\nOlivier Salazar (keyboards, piano) 2022-\nSandy Silva (percussive dance) 1998-\nTimi Turmel (accordion, vocals) 2023-\nAndré Verreault (trombone) 1990-\nPast members include:\n\nYves Lambert (accordion, jaw harp, harmonica, melodeon, (solo) vocals) 1976-2002 (founding member)\nAndré Marchand  (guitar, feet, (solo) vocals) 1976–1990 (founding member)\nMario Forest (spoons, harmonica, vocals) 1976–1979, 1980–1984 (founding member)\nGilles Cantin (guitar, feet, (solo) vocals) 1977–1981 (deceased)\nJacques Landry (bones, bodhrán, fiddle) 1977\nPierre Laporte (fiddle, (solo) vocals) 1977–1981\nLisa Ornstein (piano, fiddle) 1979\nGuy Bouchard (spoons, guitar, fiddle, vocals) 1980\nMartin Racine (guitar, mandolin, feet, fiddle, vocals) 1980–1997\nDaniel Roy (flageolet, jaw harp, bones, bodhrán, (solo) vocals) 1982–1985\nBernard Simard (guitar, (solo) vocals) 1984–1986\nMichel Bordeleau (snare drum, guitar, mandolin, feet, fiddle, (solo) vocals) 1987-2002\nRégent Archambault (double bass, electric bass, vocals) 1988-2008\nDenis Fréchette (piano accordion, flugelhorn, piano, trumpet, vocals) 1988–1999 (deceased)\nLaflèche Doré (flugelhorn, trumpet) 1990–1993 (deceased)\nAndré Brunet (violin, guitar, vocals, podorythmie, percussion) 1997-2006\nPierre \"Pedro\" Bélisle (keyboards, piano accordion, piano, trumpet) 2000-2021\nPierre-Luc Dupuis (vocals, accordion, harmonica) 2002-2008\nFrançois Marion (electric bass, acoustic bass guitar)2009-2022\nBenoît Bourque (accordion, bones, podorythmie, vocals) 2009-2022\nLouis-Simon Lemieux (vocals, accordion, harmonica, podorythmie) 2013-2023 (alternating)\nGuest players\n\nDominique D'Haiti (fiddle) on Je voudrais changer de chapeau\nRon di Lauro (trumpet, flugelhorn) on La Mistrine\nMichel Dupire (percussion) on La Mistrine\nJacques Landry (bodhrán, bones) on La traverse de l'Atlantique\nDanielle Martineau (piano) on La traverse de l'Atlantique\nDominique Messier (drums) on La Mistrine\nLisa Ornstein (fiddle, piano) on Les Épousailles, Chic & Swell and Je voudrais changer de chapeau\nAnne Perrot (cello) on Je voudrais changer de chapeau\nDaniel Plamondon (viola) on Je voudrais changer de chapeau\nDaniel Roy (spoon) (bones) on Les Épousailles\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\nY'a ben du changement (1978) – (Gold)\nLes Épousailles (1980)\nChic 'n Swell (1982)\nLa Traversée de l'Atlantique (1986)\nTout comme au jour de l'An (1987) – (Platinum)\nJe voudrais changer d'chapeau (1988)\nJusqu'aux p'tites heures (1992) – (Platinum)\nLa Mistrine (1994)\nEn spectacle (1996)\nXième (1998, also released in the United States as Rock 'n Reel) – (Gold)\nCordial (2001)\nAnthologie (2001) – (Gold)\nJ'ai jamais tant ri (2003)\nAnthologie II, 1976-2005 (2006)\n Appellation d'origine contrôlée (2011)\n danse (2019)\nContributing artist\nThe Rough Guide to the Music of Canada (2005)\n\n\n== Awards and achievements ==\nLa Bottine Souriante has received the Canadian Juno award for Best Roots & Traditional Album on three occasions for Je voudrais changer d'chapeau in 1989, Jusqu'aux p'tites heures in 1992, and Cordial in 2002.

    "text": "The American Modern Ensemble is a contemporary classical music ensemble based in the United States in New York City with the goal of premiering, performing and recording and commissioning the widest possible repertoire written by American composers. The group's focus is to celebrate and showcase American music and especially works written by living composers. AME is also dedicated to education and outreach programs that expose communities to American music, and particularly to new music written by living composers. AME was founded in 2005 by American composer Robert Paterson, who serves as the ensemble's Artistic Director, and his wife, Victoria Paterson, a violinist, who also serves as the ensemble's Executive Director.\n\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nInstrumentation for each concert is repertoire/instrumentation-based and is drawn from a sinfonietta-sized group: flute (doubling alto flute and piccolo), clarinet (doubling bass clarinet and E-flat clarinet), oboe (doubling English horn), bassoon (doubling contrabassoon), horn, trumpet (C trumpet, B-flat trumpet and piccolo trumpets in E-flat and D), trombone, percussion, piano (doubling synthesizer), two violins, viola, violoncello, bass.\n\n\n== Programmed composers ==\nIncomplete list of composers whose works have been programmed by the American Modern Ensemble through the 2014-15 season:\n\n\n== Artists ==\nPerformer Members of AME as of the 2015-16 Season:\n\n†Denotes current core member.\n\n\n== AME Composition Competition ==\nSince 2006, AME has held an annual composition competition for American composers (North, Central and South America).

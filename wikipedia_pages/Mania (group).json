    "text": "Mania were a British pop duo composed of Niara Scarlett and Giselle Sommerville. The two met while contributing songwriting for the British pop production house Xenomania, and formed Mania in 2004. Mania was a joint venture between the record producer Brian Higgins and BMG.\nThey released only one single, \"Looking for a Place\" which was to be the lead single of their debut album, however due to its No. 29 UK Singles Chart placing, the planned album Do You Know Your Daughter's on the Roof? was never released. Several of their songs, including \"Money in My Pocket\" and \"I'm Not Shy\", were covered by the girl group Frank. All of their songs were produced by Higgins and the Xenomania team.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nLooking for a Place (sampler):\n\"Looking for a Place\"\n\"Close\"\n\"Money in My Pocket\"\n\"L.O.V.\"\n\"Baby When You Go\"\n\"I'm Not Shy\"\nTwo other songs, \"DNA\" and \"If You Need a Good Girl\", were released on the group's official website and on the \"Looking for a Place\" single respectively.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJust Like Candy blog entry\nJuly 2004 Observer article"

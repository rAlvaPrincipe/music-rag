    "text": "Darediablo is an instrumental rock trio from New York City. They are influenced by 1970s heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath and AC/DC, their bassist/guitarist often wearing an AC/DC T-Shirt. Their catalog of music have all been independent releases on Orchard starting in 2000, with their latest being released on Southern Records main label (2003).\n\n\n== History ==\nDarediablo started in 2000 with Jake Garcia (bass guitar), Matthew Holford (Fender Rhodes, organ), and Peter Karp (drums). They later changed drummers after their Sky Cohete/Subaquatico double-EP, enlisting Chad Royce for Bedtime Stories, and Feeding Frenzy, as well as for live performances. Jake Garcia also started to play double-neck bass/guitar combo for live performances, and played guitar in addition to bass on Bedtime Stories. For Feeding Frenzy, he played only guitar.\nThey contributed the song Shipping & Handling to the television show Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, for February 2004.\n\n\n== Description ==\nDarediablo started out as a blend of hard rock, jazz, and stoner rock, but have managed to focus these sounds into a style that is particularly suited to the instruments: an undersized bass (\"the Midget\") played with nods to Jake's guitar heroes, a Fender Rhodes and Hammond Organ pumped through reams of effects and distortion, and a drummer.\nTime Out New York has said, \"darediablo is a smoking, sometimes atmospheric, bass-drum-organ trio that comes on like Medeski Martin & Wood with an MC5 fixation.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nTunnel of Fire (2000)\nSky Cohete/Subaquatico (2001)\nBedtime Stories (2002)\nFeeding Frenzy (2003)\nTwenty Paces (2005)\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Band's Website\nSouthern Records – Catalog of the Band\nSouthern Records – Future Tour Dates\nRockslide Archived 2004-10-11 at the Wayback Machine – Catalog of live music for sale"

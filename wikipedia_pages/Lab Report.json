    "text": "Lab Report was an improvisational, dark ambient, band created by Matthew Schultz, Eric Pounder and Chris Blazen in 1989. The experimental project gained notoriety as one of the earliest dark ambient musical projects stemming from the Industrial music genre.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Chicago-based experimental band was signed to Invisible Records in 1990 and released four CDs with that label. The band became notable for their use of the sculptural dulcimer instrument known as the A.T.G. or Anti Tank Guitar created by Matthew Schultz. Lab Report membership had always been in rotation with special guests including Genesis P Orridge, Lydia Lunch, Chris Connelly, Jonny Polonsky, Chris Blazen, Becky Allen, Kerry Simonian, Derek Frederickson, Tom Slattery, and more.\nMatthew Schultz went on as the head of Lab Report and released three more albums with the Gein label. The project's musical style broadened to cover a wide range and became increasingly multimedia.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nFig X-71 (1991) (Invisible Records)\nUnhealthy (1993) (Invisible Records)\nTerminal (1995) (Invisible Records)\nExcision (1997) (Invisible Records)\nAll Your Little Pieces, Make Me a Whole (1998) (Gein Records)\n-Classical -Atmospheres (1999) (Gein Records)\n2000 After Death Live (2000) (Gein Records)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nIndustrial Revolution - First Edition (1993)\nIndustrial Revolution - Second Edition (1994)\nTotal Devotion (1994)\nInvisible Route Six Six Six (1995)\nCan You See It Yet?

    "text": "Would-Be-Goods are a British indie pop band fronted by singer Jessica Griffin, noted for her precise received pronunciation accent when singing. Their name was inspired by the 1901 novel The Wouldbegoods, by children's author E. Nesbit\n\n\n== Career ==\nOn her first album, released on the él label, Griffin had no band of her own, and was backed by members of The Monochrome Set. The Camera Loves Me was critically acclaimed in the UK and Japan. In 1993 Griffin worked with the Monochrome Set on a second album, Mondo, produced by Monochrome Set singer Bid and released on the Japanese label Polystar. This album was later released in the UK on the Cherry Red label.\nPeter Momtchiloff, formerly of Talulah Gosh, Heavenly, and Marine Research and guitarist in Scarlet's Well, joined the band as lead guitarist and bassist in 1999. Two EPs, Emmanuelle Béart and Sugar Mummy, were released in 2001 and 2002 respectively, followed by a new album, Brief Lives, a joint release by US label Matinée Recordings and UK-based Fortuna Pop!. By this time two new members had joined the band: Deborah Green (former member of Thee Headcoatees) on drums and Lupe Nuñez-Fernandez on bass. After the band recorded a fourth album, The Morning After, in 2004, Nuñez-Fernandez left to concentrate on touring and recording with her own band Pipas and was replaced by Andy Warren, former member of Adam and the Ants and The Monochrome Set. Would-be-goods' fifth album, Eventyr, was released in November 2008. \nThe band began working on a sixth album in 2019.\nIn October 2020 Jessica Griffin began writing (and recording) a song a day, with a new title provided the previous evening by her partner and bandmate Peter Momtchiloff. All the songs were written and performed by Jessica. Twenty of the songs were released on Bandcamp (as four five-song EPs) in 2021. These songs were released as a CD, The Night Life, in 2023 \nWould-Be-Goods have performed live in the United States, Spain, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and France as well as the UK.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nFruit Paradise / \"Hanging Gardens of Reigate\" (7-inch single, él Records, 1987)\nThe Camera Loves Me / \"Cecil Beaton's Scrapbook\" (7-inch single, él Records, 1988)\nEmmanuelle Béart: \"Emmanuelle Béart\" / \"Je lèche les vitrines\" / \"Everybody Wants My Baby\" / \"Words\" (four-track EP, Matinee Recordings, 2001)\nSugar Mummy: \"Sugar Mummy\" / \"Spanish Tragedy\" / \"Perfect Dear\" (7-inch EP single, Fortuna Pop!

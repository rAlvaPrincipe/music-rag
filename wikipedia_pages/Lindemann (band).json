    "text": "Lindemann is a German musical project fronted by vocalist Till Lindemann. It was formed in 2013 as a super-duo alongside Swedish multi-instrumentalist Peter Tägtgren. Tägtgren originally defined their sound as a cross between his project Pain and Lindemann's main band Rammstein, adding \"at least it's a mix of Rammstein vocals and Pain music.\" Together, they released the two albums Skills in Pills (2015) and F & M (2019). Tägtgren departed Lindemann in 2020, leaving Lindemann as a solo project.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins and Skills in Pills (2013–2016) ===\n\nLindemann and Tägtgren met around the year 2000 in a rock pub in Stockholm, when members of Clawfinger introduced them to each other. In 2013, when Rammstein was headlining a festival in Sweden, the German singer invited Tägtgren to their show and proposed that they do a project together as Rammstein would be on a break for the next two years. They originally planned to do only one or two songs, but Tägtgren felt they were \"too good\" and wanted to write more.\nThe name of the band \"was the only thing we couldn't come up with\". All names considered by the band were already taken by other groups, so they eventually accepted a suggestion by somebody else and simply called it \"Lindemann\", though Tägtgren was initially unhappy with it.\nOn 28 May 2015, the band released its debut single \"Praise Abort\". Their debut studio album titled Skills in Pills was released on 19 June 2015. When asked about possible future live performances, Tägtgren said it would depend on fan response to the project. Lindemann joined Tägtgren and Pain on stage for an encore performance of \"Praise Abort\" on 9 November 2016 in Hamburg.\n\n\n=== F & M and departure of Tägtgren, Live in Moscow (2018–2021) ===\n\nIn 2018, the duo composed music for an adaptation of the play \"Hänsel und Gretel\", with Till Lindemann also appearing in the play. In September, Lindemann and Tägtgren announced a tour of Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan in support of Lindemann's book \"Messer\".\nOn 16 August 2019, Peter Tägtgren announced that the new album was done, mixed and produced. On 10 September 2019, a teaser for the new single \"Steh auf\" was posted on social media announcing that the music video would be released on 13 September 2019. The music video featured Swedish actor Peter Stormare. The album F & M was released on 22 November 2019. In November 2019, the band announced a 2020 tour with members of Pain completing the live lineup. The band toured in February and March 2020, but the tour was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn November 2020, the duo announced that their collaboration had ended and that their final release together would be a concert film of their 2020 show in Moscow. Till Lindemann announced his plan to continue recording in the future under the name \"Till Lindemann\" with a different lineup. Lindemann released his first solo single \"Ich Hasse Kinder\" on 31 May 2021. A short film with the same title premiered on 26 June 2021.\n\n\n=== Ich hasse Kinder Tour, Zunge (2022–present) ===\nIn early 2022, Lindemann embarked on the Ich hasse Kinder Tour with a new lineup consisting of guitarists Jes Paige and Emily Ruvidich, bassist Acey Slade and drummer Joe Letz. Upcoming tour dates were announced, but later postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The lineup went through changes later in the same year, with Slade being replaced by Danny Lohner and the addition of Constance Antoinette as keyboardist. On 29 October, it was announced that the tour would be postponed for 2023, with the exception of dates in Russia which was cancelled.\nOn 8 September 2023, Till Lindemann announced that his first solo album titled Zunge was due to release on 3 November.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\n\nTill Lindemann – vocals (2013–present)\nFormer members\n\nPeter Tägtgren – all instruments, production (2013–2020)\nCurrent live/touring members\n\nJes Paige – guitars (2022–present)\nEmily Ruvidich – guitars (2022–present)\nDanny Lohner – bass (2022–present)\nConstance Antoinette – keyboard  (2022–present) \nJoe Letz – drums (2022–present)\nFormer live/touring musicians\n\nSebastian Svalland – guitars (2016–2020)\nJonathan Olsson – bass (2016–2020)\nSebastian Tägtgren – drums (2016–2020)\nAcey Slade – bass (2022)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nSkills in Pills (2015)\nF & M (2019)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nLive in Moscow (2021)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Praise Abort\" (2015)\n\"Fish On\" (2015)\n\"Mathematik\" (featuring Haftbefehl) (2018)\n\"Steh auf\" (2019)\n\"Ich weiß es nicht\" (2019)\n\"Knebel\" (2019)\n\"Frau & Mann\" (2019)\n\"Platz Eins\" (2020)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nPraise Abort (Remixes) (2015)\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n2015 — \"Praise Abort\"\n2015 — \"Fish On\"\n2018 — \"Mathematik\"\n2019 — \"Steh auf\"\n2019 — \"Ich weiß es nicht\"\n2019 — \"Knebel\"\n2019 — \"Frau & Mann\"\n2019 — \"Ach so gern\n2020 — \"Ach so gern (One Shot Video)\"\n2020 — \"Ach so gern (Pain Version)\"\n2020 — \"Ach so gern (Clemens Wijers Version)\"\n2020 — \"Ach so gern (Drago Baotić Version)\"\n2020 — \"Platz Eins\"\n2023 — \"Entre dos Tierras\"\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nMetal Hammer Awards (GER)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nLindemann at AllMusic"

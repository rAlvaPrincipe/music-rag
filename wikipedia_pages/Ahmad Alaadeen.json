    "text": "Ahmad Alaadeen (July 24, 1934 – August 15, 2010) was an American jazz saxophonist and educator whose career spanned over six decades. A longtime fixture on the Kansas City jazz scene, Aladeen came to wider prominence in the 1990s with a series of self-released albums featuring his swing- and hard bop-oriented compositions that led Allmusic critic Scott Yanow to declare that the saxophonist \"deserves to be much better known.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\nand the beauty of it all – Alaadeen – 'ASR Records – Kansas City (2007)\nNew Africa Suite – Alaadeen – 'ASR Records – Kansas City (2005)\nWith This Voice – Luqman Hamza – Alaadeen featured – Groove Note Records – Recorded in Lenexa, KS (2000)\nLouis Neal Big Band – Alaadeen featured – Kansas City, MO (1999)\nTaken By Surprise – Norman Hedman's Tropique – Alaadeen featured – New York, NY (1999)\nIt's A Wonderful World – Alaadeen with Jay McShann – Groove Note Records, Los Angeles, CA – Recorded in Lenexa, KS (1999)\nTime Through The Ages – Alaadeen – 'ASR 2001 (1997) – Kansas City, MO\nAlaadeen and The Deans of Swing Plays Blues For RC and Josephine, too – Alaadeen – 'ASR 1001 (1995) – Kansas City, MO\nLive Jazz on the Plaza – Alaadeen – Fandeen Publishing Company (1990) – Kansas City, MO\nClear Sounds of Kansas City – Sprint (1989) – Kansas City, MO\nBright Lights – Big City – Alaadeen with the City Lights Jazz Ensemble – Accent Music (1988) – Kansas City, MO\nTain't What Cha Do, It's The Way How Cha Do IT – Alaadeen with the City Light Orchestra – City Light Records (1986) – Kansas City, MO\nRaised Spirits – Alaadeen with the City Light Orchestra – City Light Records (1984) – Kansas City, MO\nCome Back Baby – Federal 12266 – Linda Hopkins – Kansas City, Feb. 9th 1956 – 78\"\nI'm Going To Cry You – Right Out Of My Mind – Federal 12266 – Linda Hopkins – Kansas City, - Feb. 9th 1956 – 78\"\nMama Needs – Your Loving Baby – Federal – 12365 – Linda Hopkins – Kansas City, Feb. 9th 1956 – 78\"\nDanny Boy – Federal 12365 – Linda Hopkins – Kansas City, Feb. 9th 1956 – 78\"\nEatin' Watermelon – Alaadeen with Crown Prince Waterford and Jimmy Witherspoon (1950s)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoogle: Ahmad Alaadeen\nMutual Musicians Foundation – past chair\nAmerican Jazz Museum – featured Blue Room Musician\nJazz Journalist Association article\nRiverfront Times (St. Louis) article\n\"Smithsonian Institution – American Jazz Museum All Stars\".

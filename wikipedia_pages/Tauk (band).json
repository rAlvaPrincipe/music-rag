The group tours the United States regularly every year, averaging about 160 shows. In 2015, the group released Headroom, the band's first double-CD set culled from live performances. Much of their recording is done in collaboration with engineer Robert Carranza, who has produced three of their studio albums.\n\n\n== History ==\nBand members Matt Jalbert, Charlie Dolan, and A.C. Carter began playing together while growing up on Long Island as teenagers. Dolan, Jalbert, and Carter formed their first band in seventh grade. The group initially had a vocalist, Alessandro Zanelli, who left the group in 2011 and was not replaced; they have worked as an instrumental group since. Isaac Teel entered the band later when he met Dolan in college. The group won its first major attention opening on tour for Umphrey's McGee in 2014.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent\nMatt Jalbert (guitar)\nCharlie Dolan (bass)\nA.C.

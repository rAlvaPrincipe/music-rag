    "text": "Natural was an American boy band that formed in 1999 and broke up in 2004 consisting of Ben Bledsoe, Marc Terenzi, Michael \"J\" Horn, Michael Johnson, and Patrick King.\nThey were best known for their debut single and signature song \"Put Your Arms Around Me\". They were successful in Germany and the Philippines, releasing two albums and nine singles.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band tried to get signed to a record label on their own but ended up being turned down by most of the major labels. They originally worked with manager Veit Renn and recorded several songs. The band eventually turned to Lou Pearlman, who had had success with some of the biggest boy bands in the world. Renn was not pleased with this and sued. The outcome of the case is unknown, though the band did eventually stay with Pearlman. The band was signed under Transcontinental Records and released albums under that label in the U.S. and Sony BMG abroad.\nUnlike most boy bands who are vocal groups, the members of Natural all played instruments. Renn claims he was the one who insisted they learn instruments, spending $75,000 on their training. However certain members such as Horn and Terenzi had been playing since childhood.\nIn mid-2000, Pearlman hired Steve Kipner to write Natural's first single, \"Put Your Arms Around Me\". He also struck a deal with teenage accessories store Claire's. The store sold the single as an extra with a $12 or more purchase. A joint tour with the Monkees in conjunction with Claire's followed. However, the single never actually charted on the Billboard Hot 100. The single became No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 Single sales chart yet that had little impact on the general public.\nNatural attempted promotions in the U.S. several times in the next few years, though sporadically. Such promotions included several interviews and features in POPstar Magazine, performing in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade 2001, performing medley tribute to the Bee Gees as part of ABC's 'Disco Ball' in 2003, and at one point a mall tour with Saks Fifth Avenue. Yet they still never charted or had successful radio play outside of Orlando.\nPearlman decided to wait on the U.S. release and the band went back to Germany where their first album Keep It Natural was released. The album exploded onto the top of the charts in many territories across the world, and debuted at No. 2 in Germany. The band continued with 8 top 10 singles and multiple Number 1's. The tours grew from Club-sized venues to Arena Tours.\nThe band began performing at NASA events in 2001. They sang at the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavour at the start of its 16th flight. They also performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" for the crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia before it launched. They were planning to co-write a space-themed song with astronaut William C. McCool before his death in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.\n\n\n== Other projects ==\nBen Bledsoe started a solo career in 2005 and released his own indie solo CD Insomniac's Guide to a Lonely Heart, for which he wrote much of the music and lyrics. He toured the US and Germany in support of it. He has also acted in several television shows and films.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArchived Transcontinental Page\nAllmusic entry\nBen Bledsoe's Official Website\nMarc Terenzi's Official Website (in German)"

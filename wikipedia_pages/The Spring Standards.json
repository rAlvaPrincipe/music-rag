    "text": "The Spring Standards is a three-piece folk-rock band based in New York City.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n James Cleare, Heather Robb, and James Smith first sang together in the last summer of the 20th century. Having just turned 16, the three teens with a common affinity for \"oldies\" music and harmony spent the next two years performing in the Delaware/Pennsylvania area. \nInfluenced as much by their parent's record collections as they were by what they heard on the radio, their style began to form. The group dissolved after they graduated. Living near each other in NYC, they picked up where they had left off years earlier.\nCleare, Robb, and, Smith are all songwriters and multi-instrumentalists. They create a sound that listeners might expect from a band twice their size. With an emphasis on 3-part harmony and instrumental switching, their range, and energy onstage make each live show a unique event.\nBefore they were The Spring Standards, all three members were in Old Springs Pike along with John Gallagher, Jr. The three current members played together in an earlier band called The Urban Wombats.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe band members are:\n\nJames Cleare - vocals, acoustic, bass, and electric guitars, harmonica, drums, and percussion\nHeather Robb - vocals, melodica, keyboard, glockenspiel, drums, accordion, and percussion\nJames Smith - vocals, acoustic, bass and electric guitars, trumpet, drums, and percussion\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nThe Spring Standards released their first EP No One Will Know in July 2008 which was co-produced by Rhett Miller of Old 97s and engineered by Kieran Kelly of The Buddy Project. The self-released EP found mild success in the Northeast, leading to an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. On April 13, 2010, they self-released their first full-length album Would Things Be Different produced by Bryce Goggin (Pavement, Phish, The Apples in Stereo).\nThey returned to the studio in early 2011 to record a double EP entitled yellow//gold, released on May 1, 2012. The record was produced by Dan Molad.\nOn December 26, 2012, they recorded audio and video at their fifth annual Boxing Day concert at the Arden Club Gild Hall, Arden, Delaware. The project was funded by a Kickstarter campaign. The album Live from Delaware was released on May 21, 2013.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nNo One Will Know EP (Released July 29, 2008)\n\nGoodbye Midnight\nIn The Underground\nLittle Bug\nReply\nBreath And Sound\nYour Lie\nSad Song\nPin Cushion (Bonus Track)\nWould Things be Different (Released April 13, 2010)\n\nSkyline\nHere I Am\nQueen Of The Lot\nHalcyon Days\nBells And Whistles\nNot Again\nFrozen\nTrouble\nSharks\nThe Hush\nUnravel Unwin\nDrowning In Sobriety (Bonus Track)\nyellow/gold Double EP (Released May 1, 2012)\n\nOnly Skin\nHeavy Home\nChicago\nCrushing Pennies\nEnemies\nWildfire Forest\nSo Simple So True\nNightmare\nWatch The Moon Disappear\nRusty Wheels\nHere We Go\nUnmarked Pill\nLive from Delaware (Released May 21, 2013)\n\nWildfire Forest\nQueen of the Lot\nNightmare\nRusty Wheels\nThe Hush\nOnly Skin\nBells and Whistles\nChicago\nSharks\nPremonition\nHere We Go\nUnravel Unwind\nWatch the Moon Disappear\nReply (Offstage)\nFrozen (Offstage)\nCrushing Pennies (Offstage)\n\n\n== Touring ==\nThe Spring Standards toured nationwide at major venues and have been featured on Conan O'Brien (August 2008), Pepsi's Poptub, USA's Royal Pains and MTV's Exiled.

Maria explains: “Life experiences inspire me, but it's also observations of what others are going through, which could be completely irrelevant to my life, that somehow affect me, as well as my sister.”\nMusically their skills on the piano and guitar are nearly identical, but they maintain that their songwriting style and vocals are slightly different.\nIn 2006, Helena and Maria recorded their first album, Serene, consisting of all original material.\nThroughout 2009 and 2010, HelenaMaria have released cover versions and videos of popular songs for release on iTunes MP3 download and for viewing on YouTube.

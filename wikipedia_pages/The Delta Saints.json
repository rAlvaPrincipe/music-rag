    "text": "The Delta Saints was an American rock band from Nashville, Tennessee. The band consisted of Ben Ringel (vocals and guitar), Dylan Fitch (guitar), David Supica (bass), Vincent Williams (percussion), and Nate Kremer (keyboards).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 2007 after Ben Ringel and David Supica met at Belmont University and began creating music together.\nThe band independently produced their first work, the EPs Pray On (in 2009) and A Bird Called Angola (in 2010).\nDespite their increased success, the band decided to go on a little hiatus to pursue “other muses” that they’ve been wanting to chase, and other life stuff outside of music, like having kids and enjoying their marriages. Musically, Ringel hopes to work on more indie rock projects. Their drummer is working on producing a project with electronic/hip hop-type music.\n\n\n=== European tour ===\n\nThe band began touring internationally throughout North America and Europe in 2011. They appeared on German television in October 2011 in Rockpalast, performing in Bonn. A DVD of their concert in Bonn was later released in 2012.\nThe France-based blues label Dixiefrog Records combined the two EPs into one self-titled album, The Delta Saints, released in 2011.\n\n\n=== Crowdfunding ===\nThe band released Death Letter Jubilee in February 2013. The album was financed through crowdfunding using Kickstarter.\nThe Delta Saints played as the opening band for Blackberry Smoke in 2014, whilst promoting the Death Letter Jubilee album. The tour with Blackberry Smoke included Orlando, Florida (USA).\n\n\n=== Loud and Proud records ===\nIn 2014, they released another EP, called Drink it Slow, and a live record, Live at Exit/In, which was recorded in two days at Exit/In in Nashville. In 2015, the band released the studio album Bones through Loud & Proud Records.\nIn September 2015 they toured Europe again.\n\n\n=== Monte Vista ===\nThe band independently released the album Monte Vista on April 28, 2017.

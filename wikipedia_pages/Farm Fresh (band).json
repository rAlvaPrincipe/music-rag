    "text": "Farm Fresh was a Canadian hip hop group from Brandon, Manitoba made up of Mcenroe, Pip Skid and DJ Hunnicutt.\n\n\n== History ==\nFarm Fresh first came together in 1991.  They later moved to Winnipeg, and in 1994 released their first recording The Space EP. This was followed by a full-length album named Crazy Friction in 1995. \nSoon after, the group stopped developing new material.  They released a compact disc called Played Out, containing previous recordings and a few unreleased songs, in 1996. The band also appeared on Rheostatics' album The Nightlines Sessions, collaborating with that band on an improvised live track called \"Trans Jam\".\nFarm Fresh reunited for an anniversary album named Time Is Running Out, which was released in March 2005. The album was recorded in a basement studio in Brandon.\nAll of their albums have been released on Peanuts & Corn Records, a label founded and operated by Mcenroe.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPeanuts & Corn Records website"

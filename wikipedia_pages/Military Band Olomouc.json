    "text": "Military Band Olomouc (Czech: Vojenská hudba Olomouc) is a musical unit of the Army of the Czech Republic based in the Moravian city of Olomouc, in the east of the Czech Republic. It is organizationally part of the Prague Garrison Command, which is the military area tasked public duties in Prague. It is currently led by the deputy head of the Music Service of CAF, Captain Richard Czuczor.\nAfter the end of First World War in 1918, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Defense ordered the creation of a 43-member music band, which after a number of reorganizations over a number of years, began to serve as the band of the 4th Infantry Regiment in 1945. In December 1950, the Czechoslovak People's Army established its own Central Music Service with the band making up a large part. A substantial change took place in the structure in 1953, when the band was divided and part of the musicians went to Šumperk in the Olomouc Region to create a regional regimental band with 19 members. Being an official band that could perform at various military events, it spent most of the time in the Smilov Military Training Area in Libavá.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\n\nDr. Robert Šálek\nKarol Mikuláštík\nAdolf Hamerský\nKarel Pitra\nJindřich Zbožínek\nOtto Vymětal\nVladimír Peter\nKarel Bělohoubek\nRudolf Blazek\nJosef Gedenk\nJosef Potuznik\nJosef Hasa\nEmanuel Kalab\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHlučín: Koncert Posádkové hudby Olomouc (video)\nVojenská hudba Olomouc (video)"

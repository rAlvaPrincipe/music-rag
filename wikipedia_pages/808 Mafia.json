    "text": "808 Mafia is an American record production and songwriting team founded by record producers TM88, Lex Luger, and Southside, who is currently at the helm of the group. The organization also includes producers Fuse 100, Tarentino, Purps, Swede, Nonstop Da Hitman, MP808, among others. The group's name originates from the Roland TR-808, a drum machine commonly used in hip-hop music.\n\n\n== History ==\n808 Mafia was founded in 2010 when rapper Waka Flocka Flame came up with the idea of a production team, made of his frequent collaborators Lex Luger and Southside. The group quickly expanded, adding a number of upcoming and affiliated producers, and is currently signed to Flame's label Brick Squad Monopoly.\nThe group released its debut self-titled instrumental mixtape in 2012, hosted by Trap-A-Holics. The mixtape was produced by and served as an introduction to 5 of its members: TM88 (credited as Trackman), Be-Bop, Purps, Bobby Beats, and Tarentino. A sequel called 808 Mafia II was announced for release on December 21, 2012, but the release was delayed multiple times. In March 2013, a trailer for the tape was released to the team's YouTube channel. 808 Mafia II was released on April 23, 2013, via LiveMixtapes. It was hosted by Trap-A-Holics, DJ Scream and DJ Drama, and features production by Southside, TM88, Purps, Tarentino, Fuse, Chris Fresh, King Trice, OG Taxx and Be Bop.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nJaye Neutron\nKen Carson\nLex Luger\n16yrold\nPVLACE\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n== References =="

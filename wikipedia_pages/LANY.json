    "text": "LANY (, an acronym for \"Los Angeles, New York\") is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles. Formed in Nashville in 2014, the band consists of guitarist and lead vocalist Paul Jason Klein and drummer Jake Clifford Goss.\nSigned to Polydor and Interscope Records, the band have released three top 5 albums: LANY (2017), Malibu Nights (2018), and Mama's Boy (2020). Additionally, they have released a few of singles, their most successful being the RIAA-certified \"ILYSB\" (2015), the Julia Michaels collaboration \"Okay\" (2019), \"Super Far\"(2017), \"Malibu Nights\" (2018) and \"Mean It\" (2019) featured Lauv. In 2020, they released their third studio album, Mama's Boy, which was followed by their fourth album, gg bb xx, in September 2021. In 2023, the band announced their fifth studio album A Beautiful Blur. The album will be their first on Sunset Records/Virgin Records, following their departure from Interscope Records.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2014–2017: Musical beginnings and LANY ===\nLANY were formed in March 2014 when Paul Jason Klein, who had a small solo career, flew to Nashville to meet up with friends Jake Goss and Les Priest. Previously, Goss and Priest had a separate project by the name of WRLDS, but this was discontinued after the formation of LANY. Klein had been classically trained in piano and had been playing since early childhood. The following month they anonymously uploaded two songs, \"Hot Lights\" and \"Walk Away\", to their SoundCloud account with zero followers in order to differentiate between their old and new projects. These two songs were recorded within the space of four days. In an interview, Klein explains that after the release of these singles, they began receiving emails from record labels within six days, of which he still does not know how they found the music. Their debut EP, Acronyms, followed later that year, with the song \"ILYSB\" generating significant interest online, reaching more than 100,000 hits. Singles \"Made in Hollywood\" and \"Bad, Bad, Bad\" soon followed, along with the reveal of their identities.\n\nLANY is an acronym for \"Los Angeles New York\". Klein explained the name in an interview:\"We knew we wanted a four-letter word because of design and aesthetic purposes, but as you can imagine, all the four-letter words in the entire world are taken. We moved to acronyms and for a while we thought we would be TTYL, but then we decided we didn’t want to be 13 for the rest of our lives. I eventually thought of the span across the country from L.A. to New York, and at first I was thinking it would be L-A-N-Y, but people kept getting confused on how to pronounce it when I told them, saying things like 'L-A-and-Y?' So then we’re like forget it—let's call ourselves LANY, pronounced Lay-Nee.\"\n\nIn 2015, LANY embarked on American tours supporting Twin Shadow, Tove Styrke, X Ambassadors, Troye Sivan and Halsey. A second EP titled I Loved You. followed, as did festival appearances including Lollapalooza.\nIn December 2015, after signing to Polydor Records, a re-release EP titled Make Out was released consisting of all songs (not including \"Hot Lights\" and \"OMG\") released prior to I Loved You. Shortly after this, a UK support tour with Ellie Goulding was announced for March 2016 and a live stripped back version of \"ILYSB\" was released on YouTube. A US support tour with Troye Sivan ran through February, followed by the announcement of their first US headline tour, The Make Out Tour, in May. On March 11, 2016, LANY released a single titled \"Where the Hell Are My Friends\". The track debuted on Beats 1 with Zane Lowe. One month later, they released their first music video for the song.\nAfter their headline tour in May, LANY played a series of festivals in mid-2016, including Bonnaroo, Firefly, and Outside Lands.\nLANY began their second headline tour in the fall of 2016, called the Kinda Tour, in support of their EP by the same name. It included 14 European dates and 37 US dates.\nOn February 15, 2017, LANY announced they would be opening up for seven shows of John Mayer's The Search for Everything Tour. It included five U.S. dates and two dates in Canada. Klein credits Mayer as a significant influence to himself and to the band.\nThrough their official Instagram and Twitter, the band announced that they would be releasing their debut album, LANY, on June 30, 2017, to be preceded by the singles \"Good Girls\" on March 3, as well as \"It Was Love\", \"The Breakup\", and \"13\".\nOn June 30, 2017, LANY released their debut self-titled album. The single \"Super Far\" debuted on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 on Apple Music preceding the release of the full-length album. The band held pop-up shops in Los Angeles and New York to promote the album.

The live rendition of the track draws listeners even closer and into the room alongside LANY. On July 12, LANY announced that their fourth album, gg bb xx, would be released on September 3. The single rollout began with the release of \"dancing in the kitchen\" on June 25.\nThe deluxe version of gg bb xx was released on November 5, adding 5 additional songs to the record, along with the demo version of \"dna\" that was released as a single simultaneously with \"up to me\".

    "text": "Pornophonique is a German electronic duo from Darmstadt, Germany. It was formed by Kai Richter and Felix Heuser. They use a Commodore 64 and a Game Boy to produce their trademark 8-bit electronica sound. While guitarist and singer Richter also handles the C64, Heuser is responsible for the Game Boy sounds. They describe themselves as “Gameboy [sic] meets Lagerfeuer” (Game Boy meets campfire).\n\n In 2003, both decided to start a project called Pornophonique, but due to the little response from labels, Richter and Heuser decided to provide their music on the Internet for free.\nIn 2007 they released their debut album 8-bit Lagerfeuer which includes eight songs about topics like sad robots and the loneliness in the dungeon of a computer role-playing game. Pornophonique performed at more than 100 concerts in five different countries (Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Portugal).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2007: 8-bit Lagerfeuer (Album)\n2020: Brave New World (Album)\n2020: Bite It You Scum (Single)\n2023: Lagerfeuerlieder Vol. I (Album)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (German)\nPornophonique at Jamendo\nPornophonique on SoundCloud \n8-bit Lagerfeuer at Discogs\n8-bit Lagerfeuer at the Internet Archive\nInterview with Pornophonique at the Internet Archive (German)"

    "text": "Willibald Karl Boskovsky (16 June 1909 – 21 April 1991) was an Austrian violinist and conductor, best known as the long-standing conductor of the Vienna New Year's Concert from 1955 to 1979.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBoskovsky was born in Vienna, and joined the Vienna Academy of music at the age of nine. He was the concertmaster of the Vienna Philharmonic from 1939 to 1971. He was also, from 1955, the conductor of the Vienna New Year's Concert, which is mostly devoted to the music of Johann Strauss II and his contemporaries. Along with the Vienna Philharmonic, he was also the chief conductor of the Wiener Johann Strauss Orchester up until his death.  A forerunner of this ensemble was the 19th-century Strauss Orchestra founded by Johann Strauss I in 1835.  He died in Visp, Switzerland.\nIn chamber ensemble he led the Boskovsky Quartet with Philipp Matheis (2nd violin), Gunther Breitenbach (viola) and Nikolaus Hübner (violoncello). The Boskovsky Quartet, together with Johann Krump (double-bass), Alfred Boskovsky (clarinet), Josef Veleba (horn) and Rudolf Hanzl (bassoon) formed the Vienna Octet.\n\nBoskovsky was also a Mozart performer: he recorded all the sonatas for violin and piano, with pianist Lili Kraus, and the complete trios for violin, piano and cello, with Kraus and Nikolaus Hübner for Les Discophiles Français. He played in Brahms' Double Concerto in A minor, Op.102, with Wilhelm Furtwängler conducting the Vienna Philharmonic.  Other highlights include prominent violin solos in orchstral works, including Richard Strauss's Ein Heldenleben recorded with Clemens Krauss.\nA month after his last New Year's Concert, after having already agreed with Alfred Altenburger to conduct again in 1980, on 30 January 1979 he was hit by a stroke, which caused him a slight paralysis on the right side. In October 1979, the convalescence being too slow, he communicated his decision to give up and the orchestra asked Lorin Maazel, designated director of the Vienna State Opera, to carry on the tradition of these concerts.\nHe died in Visp, Valais (Switzerland) at the age of 81.\n\n\n== Style ==\n\nHis style appealed to many Johann Strauss I listeners as he directed Strauss' music in the manner of the \"Stehgeiger\", i.e. directing the orchestra with the violin just as Strauss popularised this form of conducting waltzes, polkas and other dance music alongside rival Josef Lanner in the early 19th century. This tradition was also carried on by Johann Strauss II and Josef Strauss after their father's death.  Boskovsky was sympathetic to the Strauss style.  Apart from the Strauss family waltzes, Boskovsky recorded a 10-album cycle of the complete Mozart Dances and Marches, leading what Decca Records called the Vienna Mozart Ensemble (assorted members of the Vienna Philharmonic). Many of these recordings were included on the Philips/Polygram Complete Mozart series of CDs issued in the 1990s.\nBoskovsky's New Year's Day 1979 concert was recorded live by Decca, the first commercial use of their proprietary PCM digital system.  The resulting 2-LP set was well received. Quoting Gramophone magazine: \"This is a riotous issue ... the first recording to be manufactured and released in the UK utilizing digital recording ... astoundingly vivid and atmospheric ... the results are phenomenal.\"  The album was most recently released as part of the Decca Legends series, remastered in 96k/24-bit PCM.\n\n\n== Ensemble recordings ==\nThe Boskovsky Quartet and Vienna Octet made a number of recordings for Decca Records, among which are the following:\n\nDvořák, Quartet no 3 E flat major op 51 (LXT 2601).

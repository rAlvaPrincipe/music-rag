Pepperell's sisters sing on all recordings to date.\nOn 28 October 2014, the band released the track \"Devotee\" featuring vocals from actress Jena Malone; which was featured alongside 2 more new tracks on an EP titled \"Together\", released on 9 November of the same year.\nOn 23 November 2016, the band released new material for the first time in just over 2 years, a track titled \"Gargantua\", and also announced plans to release a second LP in 2017.\nThe band announced on 15 February 2018 that they were splitting up, with their show at The Lexington in London on the 23 February being their last.

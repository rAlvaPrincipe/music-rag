They are best known for their single \"DONTTRUSTME\" from their album Want, which reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100. Their second single, a remix of \"Starstrukk\" featuring Katy Perry from Want, was a top ten hit in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Finland, Poland, and Australia. They gained further recognition by featuring Kesha on the song \"My First Kiss\", which was made the lead single from their album Streets of Gold. The album later peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2004–2007: Formation and debut studio album ===\nSean Foreman (born August 27, 1985) and Nathaniel Motte (born January 13, 1984) formed the band in 2004, naming it after the 303 area code that had (at the time of their birth) encompassed the entire state of Colorado but now serves only the Denver metropolitan area and Boulder. The two met while attending University of Colorado and they decided to form 3OH!3 after sharing similar musical interests. Prior to forming the band, Motte was DJing in the area at local hip-hop shows. Foreman was competing in MC battles and formed his first hip-hop group with Devin Scheffel. \nThe first track 3OH!3 created was \"Say 'Dem Up\" from their self-titled debut album. The duo released their debut single \"Holler Til You Pass Out\" on August 18, 2006, along with its music video. They released their self-titled debut album on July 2, 2007, as well as the second single \"Electroshock\" that same day. The duo recorded the album in their basement and was recorded through their \"in-our-shower mixtape thing.\" The duo soon began garnering some success, opening for The Blackout Pact and the Faint, as well as headlining two shows at the Marquis. 3OH!3 then signed to Photo Finish Records, a division of Atlantic Records and planned to start recording their second album.

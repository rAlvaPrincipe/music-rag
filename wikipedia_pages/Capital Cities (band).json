Their debut EP was released on June 7, 2011, with lead single \"Safe and Sound\" which became their only top ten hit single.\nA subsequent single, \"Kangaroo Court\", was released on March 27, 2012. The band was featured on the Pop Up #1 compilation selected by Perez Hilton that was released on August 7, 2012. The band's song \"Safe and Sound\" charted at #1 on the US Alternative Songs chart. The song was also used in a German Vodafone commercial, in a television commercial in the United States and Canada for the 2014 Mazda 3, and in an Air New Zealand in-flight safety video. The song \"Center Stage\" was featured on ESPN's First Take where they played a short segment of the retro-sounding track before going to commercial breaks.\nThe band's debut album, In a Tidal Wave of Mystery, was released June 4, 2013 via Capitol Records in partnership with Lazy Hooks. It was the first release of new material on Capitol with a Universal Music Group catalog number. The album debuted at number sixty-six on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe two musicians met after Merchant responded to Simonian's open ad on Craigslist offering his production services. They began jingle-writing together. After three years successfully  composing music for commercials and advertising campaigns, the duo formed Capital Cities. The band released its debut, self-titled EP in June 2011 via their label, Lazy Hooks.\nIn 2012, the band signed with Capitol Records. In partnership with Lazy Hooks, the label released In a Tidal Wave of Mystery, the band's debut album, on June 4, 2013. The album takes its name from the lyrics of its top 10 Modern Rock radio hit \"Safe and Sound\",  the album's first single. The song has been used in promotional campaigns for HBO, Smart Car, Microsoft, Mazda and many other spots. The album includes the songs \"Kangaroo Court\" and \"I Sold My Bed, But Not My Stereo\". Outkast's André 3000, vocalist Shemika Secrest and NPR's Frank Tavares are featured on the song \"Farrah Fawcett Hair\". The album is produced and mixed entirely by the pair of Merchant and Simonian. The artwork is by Brazilian artist João Lauro Fonte.\n\nThe band embarked on its first-ever North American outing, the \"Dancing with Strangers\" tour, with special guests Gold Fields, which kicked off on April 23, 2013, at the Crescent Ballroom in Phoenix, Arizona. Capital Cities' May 9 show at New York City's Irving Plaza sold out two months in advance as well two nights at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. All proceeds from the June 7 show at the El Rey went to MusiCares and a Place Called Home. The band has also appeared and performed at Sundance, SXSW, SweetLife, and ULTRA.\nThe band premiered the official video of \"Safe and Sound\" on April 25, 2013 on Vevo. The clip was directed by Grady Hall (who also has worked with Beck and Modest Mouse). In the video, the song fuels a mash-up of the past 100 years of dance, presided over by the band at the newly restored Los Angeles Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The video featured work from Emmy-nominated choreographer Mandy Moore. The video was nominated for two 2013 MTV Video Music Awards: Best Art Direction and Best Visual Effects. The video won a 2013 MTV Video Music Award for Best Visual Effects.\nIn May 2013, \"Safe and Sound\" reached number one on the German Singles Chart.\nSeptember 5, 2013 marked the premiere of the \"Kangaroo Court\" music video. The video features appearances from Darren Criss, Shannon Woodward, and Channing Holmes. The story tells of a zebra (Merchant) who has been forbidden from a club, The Kangaroo Court. Attempting entry disguised as a horse, he falls for a lapdog (Woodward). Her date that night, a bulldog (Criss), becomes jealous and reveals the zebra for who he actually is. The zebra is placed under arrest for his crime and sent to court to face a kangaroo judge (Holmes). He is found guilty immediately and is executed by a lion (Simonian).\nThe band was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Video.\nCapital Cities joined Katy Perry on the North American leg of her Prismatic World Tour.\nIn April and May 2016, nearly three years after the release of the band's debut album, the official Capital Cities Facebook page made two posts strongly suggesting that new music was in the works. Two years later, the band released four singles within the span of four weeks and followed up with the release of Solarize on August 10, 2018 as their latest album to date.\nIn October 2023, they released the single \"Skeleton Man\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

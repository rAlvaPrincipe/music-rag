The Named released their self-titled album (originally released as The Shizit) in 2009 under D-Trash. In 2015, after 6 years of inactivity, Glitch Mode Recordings re-mastered and re-issued The Named with a brand new track, titled \"Discipline\", and a slightly altered track order.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\nThe Named (2009, reissued 2015)\nSingles\n\"Fuck the Noise\" (2009)\n\"Discipline\" (2015)\n\n\n== References =="

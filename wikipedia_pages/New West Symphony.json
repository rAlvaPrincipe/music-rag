In May 2012, the orchestra announced the appointment of Marcelo Lehninger,  who had conducted the orchestra in January 2011 as an emergency substitution and then again in scheduled appearances in April 2012. Lehninger became music director on September 30, 2012. Lehninger performed for 3 seasons and left in 2016.

    "text": "Cidinho and Doca (in Portuguese Cidinho e Doca, also as Cidinho & Doca) is a Rio de Janeiro-based Brazilian rap duo made up of Sidney da Silva (MC Cidinho) and Marcos Paulo de Jesus Peixoto (MC Doca), two proibidão rappers.\n\n\n== Rapping career ==\n\nCidinho e Doca are part of the Proibidão (\"Strongly Prohibited\") subgenre of Funk carioca. Most proibidão are illegal to perform or broadcast due to their lyrics promoting drug gangs and associated crimes, and acts within the genre are extremely localized as a result.\nCidinho and Doca are known for their rendition of \"Rap das Armas\" (English: Rap of Weapons), a 1990s song originally by Junior e Leonardo. This version gained popularity among European electronic DJs, who were experimenting with Brazilian funk remixes throughout the 2000s, landing the song chart spots in Sweden and the Netherlands.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nEu Só Quero É Ser Feliz  (1995)\nÉ O Bonde da C.D.D (1998)\nDesarme-se (2000)\nRap das Armas (2008)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Rap das Armas\" (in Brazil) (1994)\n\"Rap da Felicidade\" (in Brazil) (1995)\n\"Rap das Armas\" (in Europe) (2008)\n\"Rap das Armas (Lucano Radio Mix)\" (2009)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nOs Maiores Sucessos 2005 (2005)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCidinho-Doca Site (in Indonesian) Fans"

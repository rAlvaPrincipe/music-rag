    "text": "Grand Union Orchestra, also known as The Grand Union, is a multicultural world jazz ensemble based in London. It has been performing, touring and recording large-scale shows for over 30 years and is well known for its educational work.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGrand Union Orchestra specialises in large-scale musical performances that reflect the backgrounds of its performers and often invites participation from amateur musicians and community groups. These shows can have dozens of local musicians, groups, choirs and folkloric ensembles alongside the core 15-18 piece group.\nLed by its co-founder, artistic director and composer Tony Haynes, Grand Union works to highlight the contributions that immigrant musicians and communities, particularly in the East End, make to music in London and to British culture in general.\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nGrand Union Orchestra was born out of The Grand Union, a touring music theatre company founded in 1982 by Tony Haynes, John Cumming, Julie Eaglen, and David Bradford. Its roots can be traced further back, to the left-wing theatre scene of the 1970s. Tony Haynes and Chris Biscoe were previously members of the jazz rock group RedBrass (1975–79), itself an offshoot of the Belt & Braces Roadshow political theatre company.\nGrand Union's first production was Jelly Roll Soul, based on the life and music of the New Orleans jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton. The show had original compositions by Haynes alongside classics made famous by Morton, and starred Tony Armatrading and Claudette Williams. The script was by John Cumming, who went on to found the London Jazz Festival with his production company Serious.\nThe company's third show, Strange Migration, was premiered in 1983 and toured the UK in three 10-week runs.\nIn 1984, the company was commissioned by the Greater London Council to celebrate its \"Year Against Racism\", creating The Song of Many Tongues and using the title Grand Union Orchestra for the first time. The show was performed at the Stratford-upon-Avon festival, Tring Jazz Festival, Nottingham Festival and Wigan Jazz Festival in 1986.\n\n\n=== Membership ===\nThe orchestra consists of between 15 and 18 members. Membership is fluid, with performers drawn from a roster of around thirty musicians. There has been a core of regular members since the early 1980s including Tony Haynes, Chris Biscoe, Claude Deppa, Ros Davies and Gerry Hunt. Internationally acclaimed musicians of more than 50 nationalities have played with the orchestra, many of whom are first generation immigrants.\nChris Smith, the former MP for Islington South & Finsbury and later Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, was a Grand Union director in the mid-1990s. Originally based in Clerkenwell, London EC1, the organisation's offices and studios have moved gradually east to Shoreditch, Spitalfields and Bethnal Green since the 1990s.\n\n\n=== Styles and themes ===\nGrand Union is known for improvisation and blending apparently incompatible musical styles, always underpinned by big band jazz. Its music is inspired by global influences, including Chinese, African, Indian, Bengali and Latin American, all drawing on the cultural heritage of the musicians and performers. Big band blues, Indian ragas, Latin American salsa, Chinese harmonies, Bengali songs, reggae basslines, West African drumming, bhangra and samba rhythms all feature at Grand Union performances.\nGrand Union works often address social and political issues associated with cultural diversity and integration. Recurring themes include migration and exile, anti-racism and multiculturalism, conflict and persecution, and community and social justice. Writers who have contributed lyrics for the group include David Bradford, Valerie Bloom, Sara Clifford, Masud Ahamed, Manuel Alegre and John Matshikiza.\n\n\n=== Performance and funding ===\nThe group has toured throughout the UK, from Bath to Orkney, Leicester to Manchester, and Brecon to Grimsby. In London, it has performed at Queen Elizabeth Hall, Covent Garden, Sadler's Wells, Hackney Empire, Wilton's Music Hall, The Place, the Commonwealth Institute, Lilian Baylis Theatre and Purcell Room.\nIt has worked with the BBC Concert Orchestra and its shows have been broadcast several times on BBC Radio 3.\nThe organisation receives no regular subsidy, but is instead funded through project-based grants and commissions. Grand Union has been supported by grant-giving organisations such as the Musicians' Union, Arts Council, National Lottery, Greater London Council and Arts for Labour.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Song of Many Tongues – RedGold Records, 1986\nFreedom Calls – RedGold Records, 1989\nSonglines – RedGold Records, 1992\nThe Rhythm of Tides – RedGold Records, 1997\nWhere The Rivers Meet – RedGold Records, 2000\nNow Comes The Dragon's Hour – RedGold Records, 2002\nAround The World In 80 Minutes – RedGold Records, 2002\nBhangra, Babylon & The Blues – RedGold Records, 2005\n12 For 12 – RedGold Records, 2011\nIf Paradise – RedGold Records, 2011\n\n\n== Shows ==\nSince 1982, nearly forty different shows have been performed by the orchestra or band.\n\nJelly Roll Soul (1982)\nThe Lost Chord (1983)\nStrange Migration (1983)\nThe Song of Many Tongues (1984)\nThe Lightning and The Rainbow (1985)\nThreads (1986)\nA Book of Numbers (1987)\nFreedom Calls (1989)\nIf Music Could...

They are well known for large-scale projects involving young people and community groups.\nThe organisation has taken part in projects with Centres for Advanced Training (CATs) and music hubs across the UK, alongside workshops with county/borough ensembles and a variety of one-off workshops or short residencies.\nThey continue to run cross-cultural music workshops throughout the UK.\n\n\n=== Grand Union Band ===\nThe Grand Union Band is a smaller ensemble composed of Grand Union regulars, featuring up to 10 musicians. The band has been performing at clubs and festivals since the late 1980s and has released one album, Around The World In 80 Minutes.\nThe 2002 album actually features several versions of the Grand Union Band; the 20 songs were recorded in five different locations round the world. The group's musical core mirrors that of the Grand Union Orchestra, drawing on influences from Bangladesh, Latin America, the Caribbean, Portugal and the Far East.\n\n\n=== Youth Orchestra ===\nThe Grand Union Youth Orchestra (GUYO) was founded in 2007 to bring together young musicians aged 12–26 who wish to explore the world's major musical cultures.\nFree monthly masterclasses and workshops are given by professional musicians including regular members of Grand Union Orchestra such as Claude Deppa and Louise Elliott. Primarily based in London, GUYO also operates regularly in Cambridge, Croydon and Essex.\nAs well as aiming to give young people an educational experience for its own sake, the Youth Orchestra offers a pathway for upcoming musicians to the full Grand Union Orchestra, which has seen several musicians join the senior ensemble. Young people who play non-Western instruments are particularly encouraged to join the ensemble. With a focus on improvisation skills, the Youth Orchestra explores music from the cultures flourishing in London today.\nIn 2018, the Youth Orchestra was sponsored by the Ronnie Scott Charitable Foundation for a series of jazz and world music workshops.\nIn 2019, the Youth Orchestra performed at the All Points East festival in Victoria Park, east London.\nThe composition of the group is truly international, reflecting the multicultural nature of London. Members' countries and regions of origin include Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Bangladesh, China, India, East Africa, South Africa and the Caribbean.\n\n\n=== Summer School ===\nGrand Union's residential summer school has been held annually since it was founded in 2014. Young musicians aged 12–21 can attend to learn world music techniques first-hand from experts, and develop their creative and improvisational skills. Summer schools have been held in Peterborough, Essex and London.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite\nGrand Union Orchestra discography at Discogs"

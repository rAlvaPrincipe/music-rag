    "text": "The Mermen are an American instrumental rock band from San Francisco, California formed in 1989. They have since moved to Santa Cruz, California.\nThe group's sound was originally rooted in surf and psychedelic rock music of the 1960s, although they have made \"sincere attempts to get away from the surf music label\" and currently delve into many genres, mainly driven by the melodic visions of the band's founder, songwriter, and guitarist Jim Thomas. The band's music is entirely instrumental and \"does a good job of defying description\". The Mermen perform as a power trio: electric guitar, electric bass, and drums, with occasional guests for live concerts. They were featured in the soundtrack of the Sony PlayStation video game Road Rash 3D and have contributed music for films as well.\nThe 2010 album, In God We Trust, was their first release in a decade. It was followed in December 2012 by their first full-length Christmas release, \"Do You Hear What I Hear - A Very MERMEN Christmas\".\nThomas also fronts The Shitones, an associated band that features some of the same personnel (Jennifer Burnes on bass, and Shigemi Komiyama on drums prior to his 2014 death.) While Mermen feature Thomas's original compositions almost exclusively, the Shitones are a cover band that emphasizes instrumental rock hits of the 1950s and '60s by the likes of Link Wray and The Ventures, along with instrumental versions of songs by Neil Young, The Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix and others.\n\n\n== Albums ==\nKrill Slippin' (1989)\nFood for Other Fish (1994)\nLive at the Haunted House (1995)\nA Glorious Lethal Euphoria (1995)\nSongs of the Cows (1996)\nOnly You (1997)\nSunken Treasure (1999)\nThe Amazing California Health and Happiness Road Show (2000)\nIn God We Trust (2010)\nBlues of Elsewhere (Jim Thomas solo) (2011)\nDo You Hear What I Hear - A Very MERMEN Christmas (2012)\nWe Could See it in the Distance (2017)\nThe Magic Swirling Ship (2017)\nA Murmurous Sirenic Delirium (2019)\nSplendeurs Et Miseres (2021)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMermen official website\nThe Mermen live concerts at archive.org\nMermen equipment recovered\n\n\n=== Live shows ===\nLive at Cubberly Community Center - 20 March 1998\nLive at Slims - 5 January 2002\nLive at 19 Broadway - 11 December 2002\nLive at Great American Music Hall - 3 January 2003\nLive at Fernwood Resort - 19 July 2003\nLive at Mavericks Surf Shop - 27 February 2004\nLive at Half Moon Bay Yacht Club - 6 April 2008\nLive at The Independent - 30 January 2010\nLive at The Chapel - 14 February 2015\nLive at Haight & Ashbury Street Fair - 10 June 2018\nLive at The Miners Foundry Nevada City - 21 June 2019\nLive at Cocoanut Grove Santa Cruz - 17 May 2019\nLive at Great American Music Hall - 14 August 2019\nLive at The Fillmore - 14 February 2020\nLive at The Chapel - 12 November 2020\nLive at The Center for the Arts, Grass Valley - 25 September 2021\nLive at Great American Music Hall - 20 March 2022\nLive at Taros Essaouira Morocco - 22 September 2022"

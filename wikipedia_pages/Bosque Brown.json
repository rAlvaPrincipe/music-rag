    "text": "Bosque Brown is an American indie band from the music town of Denton, Texas.\nWhile attending college there, singer-songwriter Mara Lee Miller chose \"Bosque Brown\" for her music, named after a river that runs through Stephenville, Texas, her childhood home. She recorded a handful of demos and had her husband hand them over to songwriter Damien Jurado after a show. He contacted her again and helped her to secure a recording opportunity in Seattle, Washington.\nThe resulting EP is 2005's Bosque Brown Plays Mara Lee Miller, a recording that includes various contributions by Jurado, producer Eric Fisher, with mastering duties by Pedro the Lion's David Bazan and T.W. Walsh. The first effort from Miller and company has been lauded for its vulnerability and darkness.\nThe band's follow up album, Baby, was released in March 2009.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBosque Brown Plays Mara Lee Miller (2005, Burnt Toast Vinyl, btv064)\nCerro Verde (one-sided 12\") (2006, Burnt Toast Vinyl, btv073)\nBaby (March 2009, Burnt Toast Vinyl, btv084)\nUs (June 2015, Bandcamp, digital release)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\nMusique: Bosque Brown - Baby (archive)\n\"Bosque Brown â€“ \"Baby\" sur Culturopoing\".

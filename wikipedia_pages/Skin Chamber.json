    "text": "Skin Chamber was a short-lived industrial metal band formed by Controlled Bleeding members Paul Lemos and Chris Moriarty as a side project. The band issued two studio albums, Wound (1991) and Trial (1993), before disbanding after the release of the latter.\n\n\n== History ==\nLemos and Moriarty formed Skin Chamber after Controlled Bleeding entered a hiatus due to a dispute with the label Wax Trax! Records. Unlike Controlled Bleeding, Skin Chamber had a distinct guitar-based sound that was similar in tone to early Swans (cited by the band as their main influence), the music was also influenced by extreme metal and grindcore. Skin Chamber was not dissimilar to the band's other side projects, namely Fat Hacker and Joined at the Head.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nWound (1991; Roadracer)\nTrial (1993; Roadrunner)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSkin Chamber at AllMusic \nSkin Chamber at Discogs.com\nPaul Lemos interview about Skin Chamber"

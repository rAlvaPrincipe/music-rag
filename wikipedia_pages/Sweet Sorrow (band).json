    "text": "Sweet Sorrow (Korean: 스윗 소로우) is a South Korean male vocal group formed in 2002. Originally a quartet, its current members consist of In Ho-jin, Song Woo-jin and Kim Young-woo. In 2019, they joined with female vocal group The Barberettes and performed together under the name \"SBSB\" (스바스바).\n\n\n== History ==\nIn Ho-jin, Song Woo-jin, Sung Jin-hwan and pianist Kim Young-woo first met around 1996 as students at Yonsei University and were all members of the university glee club. Together with four other friends, they formed their own eight-member a cappella group and received a positive response. The name \"Sweet Sorrow\" was taken from the quote \"Parting is such sweet sorrow\" in Romeo and Juliet and was conceived by Kim, an English literature major, as a reminder of the hardship they had gone through together. Only the four of them chose to pursue music professionally and debuted in 2002.\nAfter a stint performing cover songs at college festivals and events, the quartet came to national prominence by winning the Daesang (Grand Prize) at the 16th Yoo Jae-ha Music Competition for their original song \"Sweet Sorrow\". They were signed by the company Mezoo Cultures and released their first album in 2005. They also came to prominence with a much larger audience for performing the soundtracks of popular television dramas and their appearances on the MBC singing competition Show Survival (쇼바이벌) and the KBS music program Immortal Songs: Singing the Legend.\nIn December 2017, Sung announced that he would be a hiatus for health reasons and later left permanently. Sweet Sorrow returned as a trio in 2019 with a new album. They also combined with The Barberettes to form a mixed group called \"SBSB\" and performed together on Immortal Songs.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

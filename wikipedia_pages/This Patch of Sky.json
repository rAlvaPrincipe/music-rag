    "text": "This Patch of Sky were an Oregon instrumental post rock band, formed in 2010 in Eugene. The band typically composed cinematic instrumental pieces that combine subtle-nuanced melodies and wall-of-sound guitars to create a symphonic landscape.  The band was signed to German indie label Oxide-Tones in 2011 and released \"The Immortal, The Invisible\" and \"Newly Risen, How Brightly You Shine\".  In 2013 Oxide-Tones became extinct, resulting in the band releasing full-length album \"Heroes and Ghosts\" independently.  In August 2014, the band released a full-length self-titled album independently. In September 2017, the band signed with Graphic Nature Records, an imprint of Equal Vision Records and released a full-length \"These Small Spaces\". In September 2019, they disbanded.\nOn December 30, 2014, This Patch of Sky's studio album Heroes and Ghosts was chosen as AmpKicker's Top 20 albums of 2013.\nIn January 2014, This Patch of Sky was voted as \"Most Improved Artist\" in the annual Postrockstar 2013 Year End awards.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent\n\nFormer\nAndrew Sandahl – guitar (2010–2012)\nChris King - keyboards, synthesizer, rhodes (2012–2015)\nAustin Zentz - guitar (2012–2013)\nNate Trowbridge – drums (2010–2016)\nJoel Erickson – bass, synth, rhodes (2010–2019)\nKit Day – guitar (2010–2019)\nJoshua Carlton – guitar (2012–2019)\nAlex Abrams – cello (2014–2019)\nNeal Williams - bass (2019–2019)\nKatya Marcusky – drums (2016–2019)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nHeroes and Ghosts (2013)\nS/T (2014)\nThese Small Spaces (Sept 22nd 2017)\n\n\n=== Soundtracks ===\nBrand:  A Second Coming (2015)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nThe Immortal, The Invisible (2011)\nNewly Risen, How Brightly You Shine (2012)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nHeroes and Ghosts appears on the \"Ode To An Unspoken Moment\" Compilation(2013)\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nTheir song \"With Morning Comes Hope\" is featured in \nTheir song \"Newly Risen, How Brightly You Shine\" is featured in the 2014 \"\nTheir song \"A Light In The Attic\" is used for the trailer [1]Cuando Toco - When Touched\nTheir song \"A Light In The Attic\" is used for 2012 \nTheir song \"A Light In The Attic\" is used for the \"\nTheir song \"Newly Risen, How Brightly You Shine\" is used for a Petco commercial featuring the \nTheir song \"A Light In The Attic\" is used in the \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of post-rock bands\nList of instrumental bands\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThis Patch of Sky on Facebook"

    "text": "The High Water Marks is an indie rock band associated with the Elephant 6 collective. The band has two lead creative members, Hilarie Sidney and Per Ole Bratset, who co-write the band's music.\n\n\n== Band history ==\nHilarie Sidney, drummer for The Apples in Stereo and Per Ole Bratset of the band Palermo met during an Apples in Stereo performance in Oslo, Norway. The two became friends and began recording songs together through the mail before deciding to record together in the United States. During this time, the band's debut album Songs About the Ocean was recorded, with Sidney and Bratset performing all of the instruments themselves.\nSidney and Bratset, now married, were joined by Jim Lindsay (former Oranger member and Preston School of Industry contributor) and Mike Snowden (known for his work in Von Hemmling and Real Numbers) to play drums and bass, respectively. With this four member lineup, The High Water Marks recorded the album Polar, which was released September 2007.\nIn 2019, Hilarie and Per Ole started working on a new album with Logan Miller at his home studio in Kentucky. The album was completed while in pandemic lockdown, with Øystein Megård also joining on drums and several other instruments. Logan Miller played bass, guitars and drums. The album Ecstasy Rhymes was released worldwide through Minty Fresh Records on November 13 2020, and in Norway on Wonderful & Strange Records.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nPer Ole Bratset –  guitar, bass, lead vocals\nHilarie Sidney – guitar, drums, keyboards, lead vocals\nLogan R Miller – bass, guitar, drums, vocals\nØystein Megård – drums, keyboards, guitar, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSongs About the Ocean (2004), Eenie Meenie Records CD/LP (US) and Racing Junior (Europe)\nPolar (2007), Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records CD Wonderful & Strange Records LP (2019 Reissue)\nArivar Sullimer (2009), The Fox Pop Recording co.

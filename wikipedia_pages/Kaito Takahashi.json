He is a member of boy band King & Prince and Mr. King.\nBorn in Kanagawa Prefecture. His agency is King & Prince K.K., and he has a group agent contract with Starto Entertainment.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nTakahashi started dancing in preschool. He says he started to learn dancing because his elder sister was learning Yosakoi, and his parents encouraged him to begin dance. Takahashi's father was very rigorous in his instruction at home and he sometimes ran away from home because of this strictness. Takahashi formed a dance group in 2008 to participate in contests. He has won several competitions with his dance group and has also toured with SMAP as a backup dancer. He then left the dance group and studied dance for about two years with dancer Noppo (Shit Kingz) from the first year of junior high school.\n\n\n=== Starting out ===\nIn 2013, Takahashi’s parents sent the Johnny's organisation a resume, and told him to audition for the organisation, but Takahashi, who wished to work as a dancer in the future, argued against that. However his mother convinced him pointing out that they had paid for his dancing so far, and he reluctantly agreed. After an audition, Takahashi joined Johnny's in July 2013. In June 2015, a limited time group, Mr King vs Prince was formed as an official support group for TV Asahi's summer event TV Asahi Roppongi Hills Summer Festival Summer Station. Takahashi was chosen as a member of Mr. King. After the event, it was announced that the group would continue, and he would continue as a member of Mr. King from 2016 onward.\n\n\n=== King & Prince ===\nOn May 23, 2018, he made his CD debut as a member of King & Prince with the single Cinderella Girl.\nFrom the May issue of the same year, Takahashi began a series in Shogakukan's Betsucomi comic magazine, called Idol, Sometimes Shōjo manga artist, in which he learnt how to draw manga and become an aspiring manga artist by interviewing different manga artists. As the culmination of this series, Takahashi published an original 14-page girls' manga which appeared in the May 2019 issue of the same magazine. the title of the manga was My super love story! Prince and boys are a very fine line!. He was the first Johnny's talent to debut as a shōjo manga artist.\nOn January 1, 2022, in the Nippon Television variety show King & Prince Ru., Takahashi attempted to break the record for \"longest time running on a non-Newtonian fluid\", and set a new record of 1 minute 6.49 seconds, becoming the Guinness World Records holder.\nOn August 24, 2023, Takahashi won the 116th The Television Drama Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the TV series Passion for Punchlines.\nCurrently, he is using his talent for dancing to choreograph songs for King & Prince and Travis Japan.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== TV series ===\n\n\n=== Movie ===\n\n\n== Stage ==\nDream Boys Jet (September 5 - 29, 2013, Imperial Theatre)\nJohnnys' 2020 World -Johnny's Tonitoni World- (December 7, 2013 - January 27, 2014, Imperial Theatre)\nJohnnys Ginza 2014 (May 24, 25, 31, June 1, 2014, Theatre Creation)\nDream Boys (September 4 - 30, 2014, Imperial Theatre)\n2015 New Year Johnnys' World (January 1 - 27, 2015, Imperial Theatre)\nJohnny's Ginza 2015 (April 24 - 26 and May 30 - June 1, 2015, Theatre Creation)\nDream Boys (September 3 - 30, 2016, Imperial Theatre) - as Johnnys'5\nJohnnys' IsLand (December 8, 2019 - January 27, 2020, Imperial Theatre)\n\n\n== Other activities ==\n\n\n=== Commercials ===\nMikakuto \"Tokuno Milk 8.2 Candy\" (October 16, 2021)\nHonda \"Honda Heart\" (August 6, 2022)\nUniversal Music Japan \"Our summer songs campaign\" (July 4, 2024)\n\n\n=== Supporter ===\nThe Dance Day (2024) - Convention Supporter (Dance competition broadcast on Nippon Television affiliate from 2022)\n\n\n=== Music Video ===\nSexy Zone \"Bye Bye Dubai (See You Again)\" / \"A My Girl Friend\" (2013)\n\n\n=== Event ===\nShit Kingz Fes 2024 Momotaro (July 27 & 28, 2024, Yokohama Buntai) - secret guest\n\n\n== Choreography ==\n\n\n=== King & Prince ===\n\"Bubbles & Troubles\"\n\"Body Paint\"\n\"Nanana\" (co-choreography with Sho Hirano) song of Travis Japan\n\n\n=== Travis Japan ===\n+81 Dance Studio \"SHAKE\" song of SMAP\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKing & Prince - Universal Music Japan\nStarto Entertainment - King & Prince\nKaito Takahashi on Instagram"

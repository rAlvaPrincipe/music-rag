    "text": "Hanna–McEuen was an American country music duo consisting of first cousins Jaime Hanna and Jonathan McEuen, both vocalists and guitarists. Their fathers, Jeff Hanna and John McEuen, co-founded the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. In addition, Hanna was formerly an occasional supporting musician for the Mavericks.\nHanna–McEuen released its self-titled debut album on DreamWorks Records in 2005, although the album's singles were distributed and promoted by MCA Nashville. The album produced a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts in \"Something Like a Broken Heart\", followed by \"Tell Me\" at number 56 and \"Ocean\", which did not chart.\nThe duo also recorded a DVD-Audio/Video project titled \"Tried and True\" in 2007 for AIX Records, which featured a guest appearance by country guitarist Albert Lee.\nAfter disbanding, Hanna joined Gary Allan's road band, in which he plays guitar. He also co-wrote Allan's 2008 single \"She's So California\". McEuen, meanwhile, has continued to record as a solo artist. Jaime Hanna joined the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in 2018.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References =="

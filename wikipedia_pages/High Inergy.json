    "text": "High Inergy was an American R&B and soul girl group who found fame on Motown Records in the late 1970s. They are best known for the hit song, \"You Can't Turn Me Off (In the Middle of Turning Me On)\".\n\n\n== History ==\nHigh Inergy started in 1976 when the four founding singers were discovered by Gwen Gordy Fuqua during a Bicentennial show in Pasadena, California. The members of the group included lead singer Vernessa Mitchell, her sister Barbara Mitchell, Linda Howard and  Michelle Martin (or Rumph). The Mitchell sisters were singers, while the remaining members were known primarily for their dancing.\nFashioned after Martha and the Vandellas and the Supremes, the group was signed to Motown's Gordy subsidiary in 1977. They quickly found success with the R&B/pop hit, \"You Can't Turn Me Off (In the Middle of Turning Me On),\" which reached R&B number 2 and U.S. number 12.\nIt has always been a mystery as to why Berry Gordy held on to this female group for so long and kept releasing albums and numerous singles.  Between 1977 and 1983, Motown released 8 albums on the group.  Only the debut set was a bonafide hit with lesser returns on the second and third albums.  The company lost money on the last five albums issued.  The only real explanation for retaining them is that High Inergy was the brainchild of Gwen Gordy, Berry's sister.  Original lead singer Vernessa Mitchell left at the start of their third album \"Shoulda Gone Dancin'\" to go into gospel music.  Motown did feature the remaining trio on its highly rated Motown 25 tv special in 1983.  Unaware by viewers was that a second girl, Michelle Rumph, left due to ill health during rehearsals for the special.  She was replaced by dancer Pat Douglas.  Their single \"He's A Pretender\" was the last to make a dent on the Billboard Hot 100 charts.  Just when Motown released their last album, \"Groove Patrol,\" lead singer Barbara Mitchell left for a solo career, thus finally ending the unimpressive careers of High Inergy at Motown. \nThe group would score a total of nine R&B hits before disbanding for solo  careers in 1984.\nGroup member Linda Howard died on December 9, 2012.\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\nOn their 1980 album, Hold On, the group collaborated with labelmates Switch on the track \"Hold On to My Love.\" The song features Switch member Bobby DeBarge as the male lead vocalist. DeBarge also produced and co-wrote the song.\nSmokey Robinson performed two duets with Barbara Mitchell on Groove Patrol, High Inergy's last album, which was released in 1983.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

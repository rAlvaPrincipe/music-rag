The Band usually performs in ceremonial duties in and outside of Gibraltar.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1958, the Gibraltar Defence Force became the Gibraltar Regiment under the British Army, serving as the home defence unit of Gibraltar. They became the Royal Gibraltar Regiment in 1999, on the 60th anniversary of their formation. In 1972, the Band and Corps of Drums were established, starting off small. The inspiration behind starting a Band and Corps of Drums came from Major Arthur Ferrary, who took over the regiment in August 1972.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBritish Armed Forces\nRoyal Corps of Army Music\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nWebsite on the British Army Website"

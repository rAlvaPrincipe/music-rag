The group consists of seven members: Sota, Shunto, Manato, Ryuhei, Junon, Ryoki, and Leo.\nThe group are BMSG's first act, after Sky-Hi created the company feeling there were many problems in the Japanese music industry including talent having only a few places to show themselves in Japan, and instead would opt to go to Korean companies, hereby creating an outflow of Japanese talent to Korea.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe group's name, Be:First, was chosen with the intention of \"always aiming for the top\", and Sky-Hi hopes that the group will \"continue to respect and love the fact that others are number one at the same time as they continue to be number one themselves\". Their official fandom name is Besty (stylized in all caps), which was coined by combining the first and last two letters of the group's name to mean bestie (best friend).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2021: Formation and debut ===\nOn April 2, the audition of The First (stylized in all caps) started airing on Nippon Television Network's information program Sukkiri and online streaming service Hulu.

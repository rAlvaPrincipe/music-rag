    "text": "Viza (stylized as VI·ZA; formerly known as Visa) is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, using oud, duduk and percussion fused with more conventional rock elements such as guitar, bass and drums. The band has released various EPs and full-length albums. The band's music mixes Armenian and Greek-inflected styles with elements of modern aggressive rock and traditional music. The band sometimes blends these various genres with dance and satirical social commentary. \nViza has performed at Hungary's Sziget Festival, Sweden's Malmöfestivalen, Norway's Kartfestivalen, and Slovenia's Schengenfest and Trnfest festivals, among dozens of headline shows, as a part of 6 European tours over the past several years.\nViza was associated with Serjical Strike Management headed by Serj Tankian from System of a Down from 2009 to 2012, also featuring Tankian as a guest vocalist on their track \"Viktor\". In August 2010, Viza embarked on a series of introductory performances in Europe, opening for Serj Tankian's \"Imperfect Harmonies\" Tour in the cities of Yerevan, Athens, Hamburg, Cologne, Paris, Zurich, and Bologna. Viza accompanied Serj Tankian again during his \"Harakiri\" World Tour in the Fall of 2012, as the main support act for 19 shows throughout North America and Europe.\nIn December 2011, the band released their fourth full-length album, Carnivalia, and released the title track as a single. In July 2012, the band recorded and released their third single, a cover of the 1927 \"Alabama Song (whisky bar)\" by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. In 2014, Viza released their album Aria, and toured as direct support for Gogol Bordello, Skindred, and Soil.\nAfter a brief hiatus to focus on individual music projects, beginning in late 2017, Viza released a series of new recordings via YouTube ,on the first day of every month continuing into 2018. These 12 tracks were divided into two EPs named \"The Unorthodox Revival\", in two separate Volumes. The band continues its activities locally in Los Angeles and performed in Paris in May 2019 in support of the My Ouai charitable foundation for providing musical opportunities to disabled children in France.\nThe band has been working on an album titled 100 since late 2022, with 17 tracks. This is meant to celebrate the mark of 100 released songs, these 17 tracks filling in the gap to the goal number.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n2006 – Maktub (as Visa)\n2008 – Eros (as Visa)\n2010 – Made in Chernobyl\n2011 – Carnivalia\n2014 – Aria\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n2001 – Visa (as Visa)\n2007 – De Facto (as Visa)\n2018 – The Unorthodox Revival I\n2018 – The Unorthodox Revival II\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2011 – Bake Me in Clouds\n2012 – Alabama Song (Whisky Bar) (Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill)\n2013 – In Coins\n2014 – Midnight Hour\n2014 – Fuego\n2014 – When Doves Cry (Prince)\n2014 – Naive Melody (Talking Heads)\n2019 – Eros\n2020 – Loyal Tea\n2022 – Yesterday\n2023 – Ms. Information\n2023 – Thunderbolt\n2023 – Maggie Mae's Tavern\n2023 – Avec Toi (From Paris with Love)\n2023 – Llama\n2023 – Dingle\n\n\n== Band members ==\nK'noup Tomopoulos – Vocals, Guitar\nShant Bismejian – Electric guitar\ntheoudplayer (Andrew Kzirian) – Oud, Electric Oud, Saz, Vocals\nAlex (Alexan) Khatcherian – Bass, Vocals\nChris Daniel – Drums, Percussion, Vocals\nJivan Gasparyan Jr. – Duduk\n\n\n== Former members ==\nJohnny Nice – Guitar, Keyboards\nCarlos Alvarado – Guitar\nDanny Shamoun – Percussion\nSuguru Onaka – Keyboards, Accordion\nHiram Rosario – Drums\nOrbel Babayan – Electric guitar, Tar, Saz, Vocals\n\n\n== References =="

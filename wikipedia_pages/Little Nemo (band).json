    "text": "Little Nemo is a French rock band formed in 1983 and originating from the region of Paris (Vall√©e de Chevreuse).\nThe name of the band was directly inspired by the comic Little Nemo in Slumberland. They and fellow coldwave bands Mary Goes Round and Asylum Party were part of the \"Touching Pop\" movement.\nThe band was originally composed of Olivier Champeau (vocals, keyboards) and Vincent Le Gallo (vocals, guitar, bass). Their first releases were two cassettes, La Cassette Froide (1986) and Past and Future (1987). Before the recording of their first EP, 1988's Private Life, the pair added Nicolas Dufaure, also known as \"Bill\" (bass, guitar, vocals).\nOn stage (and in the studio, starting in 1990), the group expanded to include Yves Charreire (drums), Ronan Le Sergent (keyboards, piano, organ), and Georges Remiet (guitar).\nLittle Nemo disbanded in 1992 but reformed in 2008 with a lineup of Le Gallo, Dufaure, Charreire, and Le Sergent, releasing the Out of the Blue comeback album on 21 September 2013.\nFormer member Champeau has released several techno-oriented albums under the alias \"Doctorolive\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nLa Cassette Froide split cassette with Rain Culture (1986, Karnage Grafik)\nPast and Future (1987, Artefact)\nSounds in the Attic (1989, Lively Art)\nTurquoise Fields (1990, Lively Art/2019 (reissue), Deanwell Global Music)\nThe World Is Flat (1992, Single KO)\n'Out of the Blue' (2013, LN Music)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nPrivate Life EP (1988, Artefact)\n\"New Flood\" 7\" (1989, Lively Art)\n\"Cadavres Exquis (Howard Song)\" 12\" EP (1990, Lively Art)\n\"You Again\" 12\" single (1990, Lively Art)\n\"City Lights (Long Way)\" 12\" single (1990, Lively Art)\nBio-Logic EP (1991, Single KO)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nVol. 1 - 1987-89 (2009, Infrastition)\nVol. 2 - 1987-89 (2009, Infrastition)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nFan site in French and English\nMyspace page"

    "text": "Lili & Susie (initially Lili & Sussie) is a Swedish pop duo composed of the sisters Lili Päivärinta and Susie Päivärinta. They scored a number of hit singles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, their biggest hit being \"Oh Mama\" in 1987. Their 1987 song \"Oh Mama\" spent six weeks in the top five of the Swedish singles chart. They dissolved in 1993 and released a best-of compilation called The Collection 85-93 in 1994. The duo competed in the Swedish pre-selection to the Eurovision Song Contest 1989 with the song \"Okey, okey\", finishing 5th, at the final of Melodifestivalen 1989. \nThe duo reunited in 2008 and competed in Melodifestivalen 2009 with the song \"Show Me Heaven\". It placed fourth in Semi-final 2 leading to an appearance in the \"Andra chansen\" (second chance) round, where it was subsequently eliminated. The song later peaked at number 6 on the Swedish singles chart. The Päivärinta sisters reunited again in 2013, performing a mini-tour. In January 2014, they released a new video together as Lili & Susie.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nLili & Sussie (1985)\nDance Romance (1987)\nAnytime (1988)\nLet Us Dance!

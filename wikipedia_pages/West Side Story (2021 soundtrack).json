The album features music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, with vocals from the film's ensemble cast including Ansel Elgort, Rachel Zegler, Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, Mike Faist and Rita Moreno, who played Anita in the 1961 film adaptation and plays Valentina (a reworked version of the character Doc) in this film.\nThe soundtrack was released digitally in Dolby Atmos by Hollywood Records on December 3, 2021 and subsequently released on physical CD on December 10, the same day the film was released in theaters.\n\n\n== Background ==\nComposer David Newman arranged and adapted Bernstein's original score for the film, incorporating a number of alterations originally made to Bernstein's Broadway score by Johnny Green for the 1961 film (e.g., interpolation of the \"Cool\" fugue motif into the \"Prologue\" and the extended trumpet solo in \"Mambo\"). Gustavo Dudamel conducted the New York Philharmonic during the film's recording sessions in 2019, with additional recording by the Los Angeles Philharmonic done during the COVID-19 pandemic the following year. Jeanine Tesori served as vocal coach, while frequent Spielberg collaborator John Williams served as music consultant. The film's version of \"Tonight\", sung by Rachel Zegler and Ansel Elgort, was released as a digital download single on December 1, 2021.\nAlongside the soundtrack, \"re-imagined\" pop covers were also produced, including \"Another Day in America\" by Kali Uchis and Ozuna, which was released as a single on November 26 by Interscope Records.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nLike the film, the soundtrack received acclaim from critics and was nominated for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\nSource:\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Devils is the name of an English electronic pop band, formed by Nick Rhodes and Stephen Duffy.\nThe first incarnation of Duran Duran in 1978 included Rhodes as keyboardist, John Taylor on guitar and Duffy as songwriter/vocalist and bassist (along with Simon Colley). This line-up performed live for almost a year before Duffy and Colley left the band.\nDuffy moved on to a solo career and the Lilac Time, and Duran Duran eventually went on to fame with drummer Roger Taylor, guitarist Andy Taylor and singer Simon Le Bon.\nIn 1999, Duffy came across an old tape recording of a live Duran Duran concert from a 1979 show. Shortly afterwards, Rhodes and Duffy met by chance at a fashion show, and began talking about the old music. They decided it might be fun to re-record some of those original, dark, art-school, pre-Le Bon Duran Duran songs – including \"Big Store\" which was set in the department store Rackhams and a song eulogising the nightclub Barbarella's.\nA few months later they took to the studio, using vintage analog instruments but modern production techniques to recreate the early Duran Duran sound. The lyrics remained unchanged.\n\n\n== Dark Circles ==\n\nThe band played live only two times, in London (19 November 2002), and Cologne (17 February 2003), before both members returned to their normal careers.\nIn early June 2008, Rhodes and Duffy were interviewed by the music journalist Pete Paphides for BBC Radio 4, and relived the whole Dark Circles experience. Duffy also publicly stated through his website that a Devils DVD could be released later.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== CD: TPCD001 (UK, US) ===\n\"Memory Palaces\" – 2:27\n\"Big Store\" – 5:50\n\"Dark Circles\" – 3:09\n\"Signals in Smoke\" – 4:03\n\"Come Alive\" – 4:10\n\"Hawks Do Not Share\" – 4:51\n\"Newhaven-Dieppe\" – 3:36\n\"World Exclusive\" – 3:28\n\"Aztec Moon\" – 4:26\n\"Lost Decade\" – 4:09\n\"Barbarellas\" – 4:49\n\"The Tinsel Ritual\" – 3:14\n\n\n=== CD: CTCR-18062 (Japan, Avex Inc.) ===\n\"Memory Palaces\"\n\"Big Store\"\n\"Dark Circles\"\n\"Signals in Smoke\"\n\"Come Alive\"\n\"Hawks Do Not Share\"\n\"Newhaven-Dieppe\"\n\"World Exclusive\"\n\"Aztec Moon\"\n\"Lost Decade\"\n\"Barbarellas\"\n\"The Tinsel Ritual\"\n\"Come Alive (Tiga Swear Lies Remix)\" (bonus track) – 6:14\nTrack 13 also appeared on Headman Dance Modern, Eskimo Records, Belgium (CD 541416 501230, 2xLP 541416 501231, released 2004).\n\n\n=== CD: TPCD7 (UK, 2004 reissue) ===\n\"Memory Palaces\"\n\"Big Store\"\n\"Dark Circles\"\n\"Signals in Smoke\"\n\"Come Alive\"\n\"Hawks Do Not Share\"\n\"Newhaven-Dieppe\"\n\"World Exclusive\"\n\"Aztec Moon\"\n\"Lost Decade\"\n\"Barbarellas\"\n\"The Tinsel Ritual\"\n\n\n== Promotional releases ==\n\"Dark Circles\" (UK radio promo, 1 track only.

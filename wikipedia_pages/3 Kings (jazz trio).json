    "text": "The 3 Kings was a jazz trio, also known as the Three Blind Mice, as they wore dark glasses.  They were formed at Hot Springs High School by future US President Bill Clinton on tenor saxophone, Randy Goodrum on piano and Joe Newman alternating with Mike Hardgraves on drums.    They played in the school auditorium, the Quapaw Community Center and at the YMCA and YWCA, where high school teenagers would dance.  Their advertising slogan was \"swing pretty hard with some cool jazz\".\nAccording to Goodrum, who became a professional pianist, the \nband was influenced by Stan Getz, and covered some of his bossa nova records. They also performed a variety of blues, jazz and pop songs. He recalls that the band played together for about two years beginning in 1963, \"mostly for community events and variety shows\".\n\n\n== References =="

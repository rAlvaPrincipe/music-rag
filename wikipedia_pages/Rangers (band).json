    "text": "The Rangers or Plavci is a Czech pop folk and country music band formed in 1964 by Milan Dufek and Antonín Hájek. Its classic ensemble consisted of Milan Dufek (1944–2005;  tenor), Antonín Hájek (1944–1989; baritone), Miroslav Řihošek, Jan Vančura (countertenor), Jiří Veisser, and Radek Tomášek. The band sold over one million records.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe Rangers quickly became famous for the singing qualities of its members, from the bass of Jiří Veisser to the countertenor of Jan Vančura. The musical repertoire of the Rangers at that time consisted of Anglo-American traditionals, folk pop and country music with Czech lyrics.\nBetween 1966–1969 Jarka Hadrabová sang in the band and they won the first two Portas (1967 and 1968) in the category Country & Western. The Rangers' hits were cover versions of \"The Water Is Wide\" (1724, Rákosí), \"Cotton Fields\" (1941, Pole s bavlnou) sung as Gospel music, \"King of the Road\" (1965, Král silnic), \"Come the Day\" (1966, Ave Dies), and \"Nose For Trouble\", (1966, Nos pro trable). An exceptional success was Milan Dufek's Vysočina (Highlands).\nIn 1971 the Rangers were forced to rename into Plavci (Swimmers). The official reason was that a Czech band name could not be the same as that of \"American killers in Vietnam\" (the United States Army Rangers). Rivalry between Milan Dufek and Radek Tomášek caused Tomášek to leave the band in 1973. The host Petr Nárožný left the band as well and was replaced by Luděk Nekuda (1942–1988). Plavci were often part of TV shows and their popularity became nationwide. Although between 1974–1976 Nekuda was not with the band, the enormous success of Plavci continued. After he rejoined Plavci they became the number one music band in Czechoslovakia. Nekuda definitively left the band in 1978 and the popularity of Plavci suffered a steady decline.\nOn 17 November 2005 Milan Dufek died while scuba diving. Radek Tomášek explicitly ruled out a reunion with the rest of the band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nonly Czech sung LPs.\n\nThe Rangers (I, 1969)\nRangers 1970 (II, 1970)\nRangers (III, 1971)\nPlavci (IV, 1973)\nPlavci (V, 1974)\nSláva (1975)\nChvála písni (1977)\nPlavci na Poříčí (1978), live\nOtvíráme plovárnu (1980)\nGalaportrét (1984), compilation\nErb toulavého rodu (1984)\nVýzkumný ústav vodních radostí (1986)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCzech bluegrass\nThe Seekers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial page of the Rangers (in Czech)\nOfficial page of Rangers Band (in Czech)\nOfficial page of New Rangers (in Czech)\nComplete discography\nLyrics (in English and Czech)\nOfficial page of Radek Tomášek (in Czech)\nInfo about Antonín Hájek (in Slovak)\nObituary of Milan Dufek (in Czech)\nEncyklopedie Country music (in Czech)\nStaré televizní pořady s Rangers (in Czech)\nTo nejlepší – samples with names of original songs (in English and Czech)\n\n\n=== Video ===\nBalíček karet (original version) (1969) (in English and Czech)\nBalíček karet (new version) (in Czech)\nMám radost (1971, I Take A Lot Of Pride In What I Am, 1968) (in Czech)\nLáska je věc kouzelná (1971, Love Is Kind Love is Wine, 1967) (in Czech)\nOrchidej (1973) (in Czech)\nVysočina (1973) (in Czech)"

    "text": "Great Northern is a rock group originally from Los Angeles composed of lead vocalist/multi instrumentalist Rachel Stolte, and guitarist/vocalist/multi instrumentalist Solon Bixler (formerly of Thirty Seconds to Mars). In 2007, they were signed with the independent label Eenie Meenie Records, where they released their debut album, Trading Twilight For Daylight (2007), and their second album, Remind Me Where the Light Is (2009).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Trading Twilight for Daylight (2007) ===\nAfter recruiting drummer Davey Latter and bassist Ashley Dzerigia, Great Northern hung around Los Angeles while completing material for a debut album. Great Northern signed with the indie label Eenie Meenie Records in the summer of 2006 and began recording with producer Mathias Schneeberger. The band's debut album was completed after about 6 months of song writing, Trading Twilight For Daylight.\nThe album was recorded at the Donner & Blitzen studio in Arcadia, CA, together with producer/engineer Mathias Schneeberger, whose previous work experience includes Twilight Singers' Joseph Arthur. Having met Schneeberger through a mutual friend, they quickly grew fond of his contributions to the album.  The album title was coined by Rachel Stolte, who said that twilight is her favorite time of day.  Trading Twilight For Daylight was released in the U.S. on May 15, 2007.\n\n\n=== Sleepy Eepee (2008) ===\nThe EP originally was written and recorded before \"Trading Twilight For Daylight\", but was re-released with new artwork by Ryan Coscia and released to stores March 18, 2008.

    "text": "Special Others is a Japanese band that blends improvised jazz with post-rock influences. Their lyrics on non-instrumental songs mix English and Japanese.  The members of the band met in high school and formed the group in 1995. They began performing in 2000 and their first major release, Indy-Ann, remained in the CRJ-tokyo charts for seven weeks.\nTheir first release on NMNL Records was the EP Ben which entered the Tower Records Shibuya indie chart at No. 1, and No. 2 in the national Tower Records chart. After releasing their second EP, Uncle John, in June 2005, the band played at the Fuji Rock Festival in July.\nIn June 2006, they released Idol, which was followed by a performance at Daikanyama UNIT in July, the release Aims at Tower Records in October, and the release of their first full album, Good Morning, on November 22.  The band toured with Asian Kung-Fu Generation from late 2006, with guest appearances at five performances across Japan.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nRyōta \"Toyin\" Miyahara (宮原良太) (b. 1979) - Drums, vocals\n Yūya \"Segun\" Matayoshi (又吉優也) (b. 1979) - Bass\nTakeshi \"Dayo\" Yanagishita (柳下武史) (b. 1980) - Guitar, vocals\nYūma \"Remi\" Serizawa (芹澤優真) (b. 1979) - Keyboard, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBen (2004/08/18) EP/Mini Album\nBen\nNgoro Ngoro\nPeacefultree\nCacao\nKhechi Khechi\nDubwise (2005/06/10) Limited edition 12\" single\n[Side-A]\nMellotron\nKhechi Khechi (Uchida Naoyuki Dub mix)\n[Side-B]\nMellotron (Iwaki Kentarou remix)\nRandom\nUncle John (2005/06/22) EP/Mini album\nSunshine\nRandom\nUncle John\nMeal\nMellotron\nIdol (2006/06/07) EP/Mini album\nIdol\nAului\nSaudade\nMambo No.5\nQuinto\nQuinto Limited edition 12\" single\n[Side-A]\nSaudade (Kl mix)\nMambo No.5 (Milch of Source remix)\n[Side-AA]\nMambo No.5\nQuinto\nAims (2006/10/11) Tower Records limited-edition single\nAims\nMambo No.5 (live)\nMellotron (live)\nGood Morning (2006/11/22/)\nAims\nGood Morning\nCircle\nYagi&Ryota\nAround the World\nSession\nKoya\nComboy\nKHN\nDoor of the Cosmos (The Stars Are Singing Too)\nSurdo (2007/04/27) Tower Records limited-edition single\nSurdo\nAims (live)\nMeltoron (live)\nStar (2007/05/23)\nStar\nSurdo\nWhen You Wish upon a Star\nAll Things - Part 1\nAll Things - Part 2\nAului 80 - Self remix\nLaurentech (2007/11/14) Tower Records limited-edition single\nLaurentech\nStar (live)\nBen (live)\nQuest (2008/02/06)\nNight Paradise\nLaurentech\nOvelia\nQuest\nBump\nJohnson\nApollo\nUbiquitous\nACN\nHankachi\nPB (2009/04/01)\nTitle\nPB\nStay\nSP in Wednesday\nCharlie\nSilent\nPotato\nTwilight\nLife\nSunrise\nThe Guide (2010/10/06)\nWait for The Sun\nIt's my house\nParabola\nThe Guide\nLuster\nDraft\nTomorrow\nRCA (MONO)\nGo home\nIdo\nSpecial Others (2011/11/30)\nSailin' feat. kJ (from Dragon Ash)\nAno Kuni Made feat.

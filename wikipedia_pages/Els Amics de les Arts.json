    "text": "Els Amics de les Arts is one of the best-known bands of what some have called the new wave of Catalan folk-pop. Their songs are short stories made with simple melodies, touches of electronic music, wordplay and much irony.\n\n\n== History ==\nCatalonautes (Pistatxo Records, 2005) was the band's first demo album. It contained their first four songs, recorded at home in one afternoon. This was the first and the last album they planned to make. However, as a result of feedback they decided to make a second demo.\nRoulotte Polar (Pistatxo Records, 2006) was completed a year and a half later. They all went on an Erasmus exchange, each to a different place, but they wrote the songs together through Skype and recorded them in their winter holidays, in December 2007.\nCastafiore Cabaret (Pistatxo Records, 2008) was the group's first recorded album, with six self-produced songs. They sent 8,000 copies to the magazine Enderrock and started making homemade videos: Déjà-vu and A vegades (\"Sometimes\"). They started the Castafiore Tour across Catalonia and their music spread by word of mouth. They considered, for the first time, recording a second album in a professional studio.\nBed&Breakfast (Discmedi, 2009) came out in 2009. They started touring, hiring five musicians for their gigs. The album has been awarded many prestigious prizes. It became a Double Gold Album (more than 45,000 copies sold) and spent 74 weeks among the top-selling albums. They rounded up the tour with a double concert at the Palau de la Música Catalana in Barcelona.\nThe new album Espècies per Catalogar (Discmedi, 2012) (\"Species to be catalogued\") represents a step forward both musically and lyrically.  In the week of its release, the album reached number 1 in sales on iTunes and number 4 in the Spanish Promusicae Chart (Spain's official music chart). The twelve songs on the album are composed of melodies that blend organic instrumentation with electronic beats.\nIn March 2013, they were asked to write and produce the official song of the 2013 World Aquatics Championships being held in Barcelona.\nIn April 2014 they publish his third studio album \"Només d'entrar hi ha sempre el dinosaure\" (Discmedi, 2014). It definitely establishes them as one of the most important Catalan bands of the decade with unquestioned singles such as \"Ja no ens passa\" and \"Preferiria no fer-ho\". They tour around Catalonia, Spain, the UK and Ireland. They get their third Spanish Gold Record (more than 20.000 copies).\nIn 2015, to celebrate their tenth anniversary they performed three special shows in which they played with a Big Band. During their last concert they received on stage their first Platinum Record for the 45.000 copies of their debut album \"Bed and Breakfast\" (2009)\nCurrently, the band is composing new songs.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nJoan Enric Barceló Fàbregas (2005–present): voice and acoustic guitar.\nFerran Piqué Fargas (2005–present): voice and electric guitar.\nDani Alegret Ruiz (2005–present): voice, piano and hammond organ.\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nEduard Costa (2005–2018): voice, melodica, moog synthesizer and xylophone.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nCastafiore Cabaret (Pistatxo Records, 2008)\nBed & Breakfast (Discmedi, 2009)\nEspècies per catalogar (Discmedi, 2012)\nTenim dret a fer l'animal (CD+DVD live) (Discmedi, 2013)\nNomés d'entrar hi ha sempre el dinosaure (Discmedi, 2014)\nLa taula petita EP (Pistatxo Records / Clippers, 2015)\n10 anys (CD+DVD Live) (Pistatxo Records, 2015)\nUn estrany poder (Sony, 2017)\nEl senyal que esperaves (Música Global / Universal, 2020)\n\n\n=== Demos ===\nCatalonautes (Pistatxo Records, 2005)\nRoulotte Polar (Pistatxo Records, 2007)\n\n\n=== Special albums ===\nCàpsules Hoi-poi [Disc de rareses] (Pistatxo Records, 2009)\nLes mans plenes (Pistatxo Records, 2009) – Cooperation with the fanzine Malalletra\nNon-non (Pistatxo Records, 2009) – Cooperation with the fanzine Malalletra'\nSubmarí Pop.

    "text": "War Zone was a West coast rap supergroup consisting of Goldie Loc, MC Eiht, and Kam. They made their debut on Snoop Dogg's Tha Blue Carpet Treatment; after being unable to find them deals as separate artists, Snoop Dogg suggested they become a group, and started production on their album. According to Goldie Loc, the group has recorded about 13 tracks for a debut album. However, after time passed without finding a distribution deal, the group's various members parted to work on separate projects.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\"Don't Stop\" (from the Snoop Dogg album Tha Blue Carpet Treatment)\n\"Shackled Up\" (from the Snoop Dogg Presents The Big Squeeze)\n\"Damn\" (featuring Snoop Dogg)\n\n\n== References =="

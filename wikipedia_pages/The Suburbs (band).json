    "text": "The Suburbs are an alternative punk rock/funk/new wave band from Minneapolis, Minnesota that was popular in the late 1970s and 1980s. The band frequently headlined at Minneapolis's most influential music clubs, including Jay's Longhorn Bar and First Avenue.\n\n\n== Band history ==\nThe Suburbs were formed in the western suburbs of Minneapolis in November 1977 following introductions by Chris Osgood of the Suicide Commandos. Following live performances, they released The Suburbs on the Twin/Tone label (the label's first release) in early 1978. The record was a nine-song 7-inch red vinyl EP. The band also saw two songs, \"Urban Guerrillas\" and \"Ailerons O.K.\", included on the compilation Big Hits of Mid-America, Volume Three. Guitarist Bruce C. Allen did the art direction for the compilation.\nAfter building a following playing basement parties, the Suburbs had their first major success at influential Minneapolis punk/New Wave nexus Jay's Longhorn Bar; drummer Hugo Klaers said that after getting regular gigs at the venue, \"we went from nobodies to this super popular band. It was just crazy. The Longhorn shows were always packed.\" One notable audience member at the Suburbs' shows was Bruce Springsteen, then on tour supporting his album The River, who was so impressed with the band that he nearly joined them on stage for an encore. \nThe band's popularity increased during the early to mid-1980s, and during this time, their new wave dance sound, eclectic lyrics, and stage presence gained a following that broke out of the Midwest and reached both coasts. In 1980 Twin/Tone released their first full-length LP, In Combo.\nThe single \"World War III\" (and its B-side, \"Change Agent\") showed development of the band's songwriting abilities and improved sound. A year later, they released the double album Credit In Heaven which added elements of jazz, funk, and disco to the mix. The single \"Music for Boys\" was taken from the record and became a radio hit.\nIn 1982, the band released the 12-inch single \"Waiting\", which frequently found its way onto dance club playlists. The EP Dream Hog followed on Twin/Tone, featuring three new songs and a remix of \"Waiting\" on the B-side, all produced by Steven Greenberg of Funkytown and Lipps Inc fame.\nGreenberg then brought the Suburbs to the attention of Phonogram Inc. in 1983. Phonogram started by re-issuing Dream Hog on the Mercury label. Keyboardist/vocalist Chan Poling commented, \"We love what Twin/Tone did for us, but we've always wanted to sell records, to join the big time, and you just can't do that on a little label.\" By this time, the band's live performances were muscular and funky, attracting rabid fans and keeping the band busy as an opening act for the likes of Iggy Pop and The B-52's, as well as headliners in their own right. They often went on stage wearing matching dinner jackets. In 1983 Polygram released Love is the Law, a harder-rocking album that included a horn section and some of their most off-beat lyrics, also produced by Steven Greenberg. In 1986, The Suburbs signed with A&M Records and released The Suburbs, produced by Prince's Revolution drummer Bobby Z. (credited as Robert Brent). Frustrated by a lack of radio play and abandoned by the major labels, the band broke up in 1987.\nIn 1992 Twin/Tone released Ladies and Gentlemen, The Suburbs Have Left the Building, a best-of compilation, and in 1994 a live record Viva! Suburbs!. The Suburbs reunited during this period and played numerous shows in the Twin Cities, and have played on and off since that time including opening once more for the B-52's in 2003.\nSummer of 2002 saw the re-issues of the albums In Combo, Credit In Heaven and Love Is The Law on CD on the band's own Beejtar Records. In late 2003, the band issued Chemistry Set: The Songs Of The Suburbs 1977 - 1987 (a best of CD with a few bonus tracks and a DVD of their 2002 performances at Minneapolis' First Avenue).\nIn 2004, Chan Poling formed The New Standards with John Munson and Steve Roehm, performing some of rearranged melodies of the classic Suburbs songs in the live set including \"Love Is The Law\".\nOn December 7, 2009, guitarist Bruce Allen died aged 54.\nOn November 19, 2013 Si Sauvage, the band's first new release in 27 years, was released. Si Sauvage features founding members Poling, Hugo Klaers, and Blaine John “Beej” Chaney, plus new bandmates Steve Brantseg and Steve Price and special guest vocalists like Janey Winterbauer and Aby Wolf.\n\nOn August 26, 2014, the Suburbs announced that founding member Beej Chaney was taking a temporary leave of absence.\n2018 has the band slated for several outdoor concerts: The Brewery Bash in Luverne, MN & Down By The Riverside Concert Series in Rochester, MN plus a show scheduled for (the landmark venue) First Avenue in Minneapolis.\n2019 the band continues to be led by original members Chan Poling & drummer Hugo Klaers plus longtime sax player Max Ray (also of The Wallets). They are augmented by current members Stevie Bransteg and Jeremy Ylvisaker on guitars, Steve Prince on bass, Janey Winterbauer on backup vocals, Rochelle Becker on baritone saxophone, and Steven Kung on horns and keyboards. The band continued its live performances featuring new material plus classic Suburb songs, some of which are rearranged melodies that are toned down from the 1980s era (of the bands live shows).\nThe band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.\nIn July 2021, the band had the honor of reopening First Avenue, which had closed during the COVID pandemic, by playing two sold-out shows at the 7th Street Entry to celebrate the release of their new album, Poets Party.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current Lineup (2014-Present) ===\nChan Poling: Keyboards, Vocals\nHugo Klaers: Drums, Vocals\nMax Ray: Saxophone\nSteve Brantseg: Guitar\nJeremy Ylvisaker: Guitar\nSteve Price: Bass\nJaney Winterbauer: Backing Vocals\nRochelle Becker: Baritone Saxophone\nStephen Kung: Horns, Keyboards\n\n\n=== Classic Lineup (1977-1987, 1992-2009) ===\nChan Poling: Keyboards, Vocals\nBruce C.

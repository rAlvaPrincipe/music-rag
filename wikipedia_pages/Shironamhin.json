    "text": "Shironamhin (English: Untitled) is a Bangladeshi rock band formed in Dhaka in 14 April 1996. Following as a rock group emerging from Dhaka's underground music in the late 1990s, they were distinguished for their extended psychedelic and progressive compositions, multi-instrumental experimentation, and philosophical lyrics and became one of the leading band of the Bengali progressive rock genre. In 2008, the band became a member of the Bangladesh Musical Bands Association (BAMBA).\nShironamhin were founded by students Ziaur Rahman (guitar), Jewel (guitar) and Bulbul Hasan (vocals). Vocalist Tanzir Tuhin joined in 2002 as a fourth member of the band. Zia became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the albums Jahaji (2004), Icche Ghuri (2006), Bondho Janala (2009) and Shironamhin Rabindranath (2010). The last Shironamhin studio album, Shironamhin Shironamhin (2013), was based on unreleased material from the long term musical journey of the group. Their song \"Hashimukh\" from their debut album became well recognised after its release. The band also composed several film scores.\nFollowing personal tensions, Tuhin left Shironamhin in 2017. Sheikh Ishtiaque later joined the band as a new vocalist. Later they produced six non-album singles \"Jadukor\" (2017), \"Boheimian\" (2018), \"Barud Shomudro\" (2018), \"Ei Obelay\" (2019), \"Cafeteria Periye\" (2020) and \"Kashfuler Shohor Dekha\" (2021).\nThey have presented orchestration with rock gesture in Bengali music. They have infused classical instruments such as sarod, cello, flute, esraj, violin and many more. On April 18, 2022, they released their sixth album \"Perfume\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1996-2003: Early years ===\n\n\n==== Formation ====\nZiaur Rahman was acquainted with Jewel while studying architecture at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. Earlier, Zia used to play in a thrash metal band called Threshold formed in 1992. In the mid-nineties, Zia met Bulbul Hasan, who was studying Chayanat at that time. In 1996, the three formed a band. In the beginning, they used to serve in the University of Dhaka campus, TSC, Madhur Canteen, Hakim Chattar, Arts Cafeteria and nearby crowded places. Since the beginning, Zia used to write songs and compose melodies. Initially they made about fifty songs. On the Pahela Baishakh in 1997, they performed for the first time under the name of Shironamhin, organized by the Padatik Nattya Sangsad at the TSC auditorium of the University of Dhaka. After gaining popularity based on campus they started getting invitations to perform. A few days later, Shironamhin performed in front of a large audience at Bakultala of the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka. At that time, there were some changes in their musical instruments. They started using plugged guitars, sarod and drums in the service. All their songs performed on stage were written by themselves so they were new to the audience at that time. They started using plugged guitars, sarod and drums. All their songs performed on stage were written by themselves so they were new to the audience at that time. Their different genres of music and lyrics helped them to gain fame at that time.\nBeing an expert in Rabindra Sangeet and Nazrul Geeti, Bulbul left the group in 2000 as he could not adapt to the band. Mohin joined as the vocalist of the band. Shironamhin began the rendition of the complete instrument. In the same year, Shironamhin was runners-up in the \"Star Search: Benson and Hedges\" contest. On the other hand, in December 2000, Tanzir Tuhin replaced Mohin as a new vocalist. at the time Zia and Tuhin were classmates at BUET. In 2003, Farhan Karim (sarod), Yasir Tushar (guitar) and Kazi Ahmad Shafin (drums) joined the team.\n\n\n==== Jahaji (2004) ====\n\nJahaji was based on urban lifestyle and struggling. The title track of the album, itself speaks so. Shironamhin, tried to portray the usual daily life and elements from middle class career seeking young sailor of a Bronx. The cultural interest, the gossip in a crowded cityscape, the life of mono busy traffic etc. were conveyed with metaphor and events by this album. Jahajee was the only album from the band Shironamhin that was refused and rejected by every known record label company of Dhaka. \"হাসিমুখ (Smiling)\" (2004), from the album জাহাজী (Navigator) was a widely used song in the countries television advertisement.\n\n\n=== 2005–2017: Transition and success ===\n\n\n==== Icche Ghuri (2006) ====\n\nIchchhe Ghuri was second album of Shironamhin released from the record label company G-Series in 2006. They tried to do some experiments, draw some maturity in compositions, suited compositions for Live performances and fix in a style for Shironamhin's own. Shironamhin is keen on lyrics from nature. They tried to convey urban crisis in this album in which they did not to draw any comment or did not even try to draw any suggestion. Shironamhin just wanted the listeners to get the message with their own understanding and draw the images or characters with own personal fantasy. They mostly worked on certain topic or events on short-time span. They loved to talk about urban life, draw the urban texture. Cafeteria was a story of one second judging from vivid angles. It is based on a moment someone entering into his campus cafeteria and feel two silent eyes among so many noise and fumes around from the cafe gossiping. Shironamhin tried to make the listeners recall their own cafeteria in their campus life.\n\n\n==== Bondho Janala (2009) ====\n\nBondho Janala was a bit challenging for Shironamhin as they were very much used to with sarod sound compositions. In the album they had to explore many more acoustic instruments like esraj, silver flute, trumpet as the album was enriched with vivid orchestration. Lyrically the band Shironamhin tried to work on their already established genre of urban life talks with some bigger aspects and along with historical events or movements. It was released by the record label company G-Series in 2009.\n\n\n==== Shironamhin Rabindranath (2010) ====\n\nIn 2010, Diat Khan (guitar) joined the band instead of Tushar. The fourth album Shironamhin Rabindranath was a risky task for the band, which is basically a collection of Rabindra Sangeet. The album was released in 2010 on the occasion of the 150th death anniversary of Bengali polymath Rabindranath Tagore. This was the first Rabindra Sangeet album of any band in Bangladesh. Shironamhin considers Tagore as an institution of Bengali culture, as a Bengali, anyone who is at least sensitive to culture should know Rabindranath. Tuhin learned Rabindra Sangeet while studying at Bulbul Lalitakala Academy. In the album, they pay homage to Tagore. Shironamhin vocalist Tuhin said that Rabindra Sangeet has a combination of Vaishnava and Upanishad ideology as well as Indian classical music, Bengali folk music and western music in terms of melody. Zia thinks that many Shironamhin fans, especially teenagers, are not familiar with Rabindra Sangeet. As a result, it is an attempt to increase the interest of the young audience towards the Bengali poet Tagore.\nNine time-honoured songs of Rabindranath have been added to the album. With the help of Swarabitan published in 64 volumes, the main words and melody of Rabindra Swaralipi have been kept correct. The album also features classical, baul, folk, kirtan, sentimental and even western music. They used about 39 local and foreign musical instruments in the composition of the album. For this album they use Brazilian rainmaker, Egyptian darbuka, Irish tin whistle and Scottish Bodhran. On the cover of the album, members of the group around Rabindranath appear as disciples. Mainly it was a performance of classical music in the rock genre. The album was a commercial success after its release.\n\n\n==== Shironamhin Shironamhin (2013) ====\n\nAfter the Rabindranath project in 2010, the band started working on the songs of the new album. In 2011, Rajib was replaced by Russel Kabir (keyboard). In 2013, Shironamhin released their first self-titled and their fifth studio album Shironamhin Shironamhin, after an 18-year musical tour.

A music video of the song \"Abar Hashimukh\" directed by Tanim Rahman Anshu, starring 2007 Miss Bangladesh beauty pageant titleholder Jannatul Ferdoush Peya. The album strives to compile their confessions, demands, rage, hopes and anticipation to invite new light through the old windows of the untitled past. From the lyrical point of view, the album is more specific on topic, searching the positive sides of negative living. Musically, Shironamhin tried western classic orchestration based on violin, cello, contrabass section fused with rock guitar, bass and drums in public classical orchestration.\nFor the first time, the band released a collector's version of one of their albums. CDs have been added to the edition, and bound books have been added to the cloth covers. Where the lyric of the song, the relevant information including the background of the lyric has been compiled.

In 2017, Sheikh Ishtiaque joined as the new vocalist. At the moment Tuhin left the band, vocal went through the process of searching for the title through multiple headless auditions. The band selected Ishtiaque by recording their title \"Jadukor\" with two different vocals.\nIn 2017, Tuhin formed a new band named Avash. According to the 2019 Copyright Office, the founding member of the group, Zia, was the lyricist and composer of Shironamhin' songs.

While the band reached 29 mid-week, they slipped out of the top 40 to Number 61 for the official chart on Sunday 23 January 2011. However, they did secure Number 6 in both the UK Indie Chart and the Scottish Singles Chart. In August 2012 they released \"Take You There (Mànran & Michelle McManus song)|Take You There\" with Michelle McManus to raise money for the STV Appeal 2012. Mànran and Michelle McManus performed the song live on 7 September 2012 on the STV Appeal show.\n\n\n=== 2012–present ===\n\nIn September 2012, Calum Stewart left the band to be replaced by Irish Uilleann Piper/ Flautist Ryan Murphy.\nThe band recorded their second album The Test in early 2013 which they released in May of the same year.

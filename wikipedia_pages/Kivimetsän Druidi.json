    "text": "Kivimetsän Druidi, or KmD, was a Finnish metal band from Kouvola. \"Kivimetsän Druidi\" is Finnish for \"druid of the stone forest\".\n\n\n== Band history ==\nKmD originally started as a two-man project by the Koskinen brothers. Lead guitarist and vocalist Joni Koskinen's biggest influence has been Moonsorrow, though each band member has their own personal influences. \nTheir lyrics are based on the fantasy novel that Joni Koskinen is writing. The novel tells a story from The Land of the Crystal Mountain and Stone Forest.\nAfter releasing numerous demos and EPs, Kivimetsän Druidi eventually signed a record deal with Century Media in 2008. The debut album titled Shadowheart was released in October 2008. All the band's EPs and demos were self-released.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nLeeni-Maria Hovila - female vocals (2008-2017)\nJoni Koskinen - male vocals, lead guitar (2002-2017)\nAntti Koskinen - keyboards (2002-2017)\nAntti Rinkinen - guitar (2004-2017)\nSimo Lehtonen - bass guitar (2007-2017)\nAtte Marttinen - drums (2007-2017)\nVille Ryöti - drums (2005–2007)\nJani Rämä - drums (2004–2005) (became a technician for the band)\nJouni Riihelä - bass (2004–2006)\nAnnika Laaksonen - female vocals (2004–2006)\nLukas Pearsall - synth (2004–2007)\nJenni Onishko - female vocals (2006–2008)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nShadowheart (2008)\nBetrayal, Justice, Revenge (2010)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nMustan valtikan aika (2006)\nTaottu (2008)\nThe Lost Captains (2016)\n\n\n=== Demos ===\nKristallivuoren maa (2003)\nTaival (2004)\nThe New Chapter (2007)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial Myspace page\nProfile"

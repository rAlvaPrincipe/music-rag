    "text": "The Heath Brothers was an American jazz group, formed in 1975 in Philadelphia, by the brothers Jimmy (tenor saxophone), Percy (bass), and Albert \"Tootie\" Heath (drums); and pianist Stanley Cowell. Tony Purrone (guitar) and Mtume (percussion) joined the group later. Tootie left in 1978, and was replaced by Akira Tana for a short period, before returning in 1982. They also added other sidemen for some of their recording dates.\nThe group issued four singles between 1978 and 1981, \"Mellowdrama\", \"For the Public\", \"Use it (Don't Abuse it)\" and \"Dreamin'\".  \"Dreamin'\", a track from the 1980 LP, \"Expressions of Life\", had the most airplay in the UK despite not reaching the UK chart.\nThe group with just two of the brothers, Jimmy and Tootie, and additional sidemen as needed, continued to perform and record after Percy died in 2005. The DVD, Brotherly Jazz: The Heath Brothers, recorded in 2004, shortly before Percy's death, was one of the last times the three brothers played together, and chronicled the brothers' personal lives, as well as socio-political issues many jazz musicians dealt with in the later 20th century, including jail, drugs, discrimination and segregation. The 2009 CD Endurance was the first without Percy, and features seven original numbers by Jimmy, including \"From a Lonely Bass\", composed in memory of his late brother.\nPercy Heath died on April 28, 2005. Jimmy Heath died on January 19, 2020. Tootie died on April 3, 2024.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nMarchin' On (1975) (Strata-East Records)\nParis '76 (1976) (Sam Records)\nPassin' Thru (1978) (Columbia Records)\nLive at the Public Theatre (1979) (Columbia Records)\nIn Motion (1979)  (Columbia Records)\nExpressions of Life (1980)  (Columbia Records)\nBrotherly Love (1981) (Antilles Records)\nBrothers and Others (1981) (Antilles Records)\nDave's Haze (1997) (Concord Records)\nAs We Were Saying (1997) (Concord Records)\nJazz Family (1998) (Concord Records)\nPat Metheny & The Heath Brothers: The Move to the Groove Session (2000) (West Wind)\nEndurance (2009) (Jazz Legacy Productions)\n\n\n== Videography ==\nBrotherly Jazz (2006) (DanSun Productions)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLee Fury (March 25, 2003). \"A Night With the Heath Brothers: The Opening Act That Closed the Show\".

    "text": "The Alfee (formerly spelled Alfie) is a Japanese rock band formed in Tokyo in 1973. Originally a folk quartet, they became a trio of bassist Masaru Sakurai, acoustic guitarist Kohnosuke Sakazaki and electric guitarist Toshihiko Takamizawa in 1975. With all three performing vocal duties, they adopted a harder rock sound in the early 1980s. Beginning with their 16th single \"Marie-Anne\" in 1983, they have released 58 consecutive top 10 singles. The Alfee hold the record for most concerts performed by a Japanese band, with 2,888 as of December 2023. HMV Japan ranked them number 92 on their list of the top 100 Japanese pop acts.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter moving to Tokyo in 1970, Masaru Sakurai formed a three-piece band at Meiji Gakuin Senior High School called Confidence (コンフィデンス), which covered Western music acts such as Simon & Garfunkel. In 1972, they entered a folk music contest sponsored by Victor and won. There, Sakurai met Kohnosuke Sakazaki, who joined the group later that year. Sakurai and Sakazaki both enrolled in Meiji Gakuin University. There, they recruited Toshihiko Takamizawa, who was also a classmate of Sakurai's in high school. Confidence changed their name to Alfie in 1973, and released their first single \"Natsu Shigure\" on August 25, 1974. Their first album, Seishun no Kioku (re-titled Greenhorn on most re-issues), was released on July 25, 1975. Yasuo Miyake then left the group, leaving the lineup of Sakurai, Sakazaki and Takamizawa, which continues to this day. The song \"Fuchutorimono Hikae\" was set to be released as their third single on December 10, 1975, the day the statute of limitations expired for the 300 million yen robbery, which is parodied in the lyrics. However, Victor cancelled its release due to the connection, causing a rift between the band and their label. (The song would finally be released in 2014 as part of a re-release of Seishun no Kioku that coincided with the band's 40th anniversary.) Alfie produced no further music for Victor. Instead, they acted as the backing band for artists such as Hiroshi Kamayatsu. In 1979, they signed with Pony Canyon (then known as Canyon Records), changed the spelling of their name to Alfee, and released \"Love Letter\" as their third single on January 21.\nIn 1983, their song \"Marie-Anne\" became a massive hit. That year, Alfee performed at the Nippon Budokan for the first time. This began a 35-year tradition of them performing at the venue every year, until 2019, when renovations for the 2020 Summer Olympics ended the streak. The band added \"The\" in front of their name in 1986.\nWith their 50th single, \"Taiyō ha Shizumanai\", released in August 2002, The Alfee set a Japanese record for 35 consecutive top 10 singles on the Oricon Singles Chart.\nIn March 2014, Sakurai, Sakazaki and Takamizawa were presented with honorary degrees from Meiji Gakuin University, their alma mater where they had formed The Alfee. In the 1970s, Takamizawa had dropped out of the school, while Sakurai and Sakazaki were expelled. At a December 2015 concert at the Nippon Budokan, The Alfee performed as an alterego band named The KanLeKeeZ. The idea was, with all three members having reached their 60s, they decided to pay tribute to group sounds bands of the 1960s. The KanLeKeeZ released the album G.S. meets The KanLeKeeZ on December 21, 2016. It won a Planning Award at the 59th Japan Record Awards in 2017.\nDue to providing the theme song to Kansai TV's broadcast of the Osaka International Women's Marathon for 31 consecutive years from 1987 until 2018, when the broadcaster announced they would no longer use themes, The Alfee were certified with the Guinness World Record for \"Most theme songs sung by the same artist for the same international sports event broadcast on TV\" in December 2018.\nWith the release of \"The 2nd Life -Daini no Sentaku-\" in July 2021, The Alfee achieved 55 consecutive top 10 singles on the Oricon Singles Chart. This tied them with SMAP and AKB48 for second place, behind Arashi with 58. Celebrating their 50th anniversary, they performed at the Nippon Budokan on December 23 and 24, 2023. The former marked their 100th concert at the venue. The July 2024 double A-side \"Ko.Da.Ma.\" / \"Romance ga Maiorite Kita Yoru\" was their 58 consecutive top 10 single, returning them to second place alongside Arashi, and behind AKB48 with 62.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMasaru Sakurai (桜井 賢, Sakurai Masaru): Born  (1955-01-20) January 20, 1955 in Chichibu, Saitama.

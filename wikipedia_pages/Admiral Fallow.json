    "text": "Admiral Fallow are a Scottish musical group formed in 2007 by singer-songwriter Louis Abbott and based in Glasgow. They were originally named Brother Louis Collective. The band's first album, Boots Met My Face, was released worldwide in 2011. Their song \"Squealing Pigs\" was used on NBC's Chuck and was performed live on the BBC's Hogmanay Live 2011.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Boots Met My Face ===\n\nBoots Met My Face was recorded in July 2009 and produced at the Glasgow studio Chem 19 by engineer Paul Savage (former Delgados drummer and winner of the 2010 UK Producers' Guild \"Breakthrough Producer of the Year\" award). The album recording was partially funded by Creative Scotland.\nLead singer and main writer Louis Abbott has said that \"All of the songs document the first chapter of my life, be it memories from school or kicking a ball about with my childhood chums. All are taken from real life events. There's no fiction. I'm not into making up stories or characters for the sake of trying to stir emotions. They are songs about friends and family as well as a fair bit of self-evaluation\".\nThe album title comes from a line in \"Subbuteo\" which references an incident when Abbott was beaten up at the age of 15 in his home town of Edinburgh.\n\"Squealing Pigs\" was first released as a single in the UK released in April 2010 by Lo-Five Records, followed by Boots Met My Face in April 2010, re-released in March and June 2011. The release garnered album of the week praise in the Daily Record, The List and was named the Best Album of 2010 by Scottish music website \"The Pop Cop\". In addition, Linn Records made the album available as one of their famed 24-bit Studio Master Downloads, calling it the \"Record of the Week\" for 19 July. Boots Met My Face was later released in Germany by Indigo Records on 13 August 2010. Another single, \"Subbuteo\" (backed with an alternate version of \"Delivered\"), was released in October 2010.\n\n\n=== Tree Bursts in Snow ===\nTree Bursts in Snow was released on 21 May 2012. The first 500 preorders were signed by the band in Reading at their distributors on 14 May. Frontman and principal songwriter Louis Abbott explained the meaning of the title:\n\nThe title refers to the sound and the image of an artillery shell exploding into a cluster of snow-drenched trees... I'm also astounded by the sheer volume of gun related violent crimes throughout the world but in particular in the U.S. The lyric from 'Tree Bursts' was inspired by the idea of the effect that losing friends through violence, in particular during times of war or conflict has on young men and women. They are \"the leaves that fall louder than backfire, all orange and halloween red\".\nAnother music video was released on 24 July for \"Guest of the Government\" along with information regarding its release as a single with a new b-side called \"Concrete Oaths\". \"Concrete Oaths\" was previously released in 2010 on an album entitled Glad Cafe.\nA third music video was released on 8 November 2012 for \"Isn't This World Enough??\". It includes footage of Admiral Fallow on tour around the UK and USA. The single was released on 10 December 2012.\n\n\n=== Tiny Rewards ===\nTiny Rewards, Admiral Fallow's third studio album, was released on 25 May 2015.\n\n\n== Touring ==\n\nIn July 2009 the band headlined the Sunday night T Break stage at T in the Park.

One of their highlights was a gig at the 02 ABC on 27 January, prompting The Shetland Times to rate an enthusiastic review; \"There are very few occasions when one is lucky enough to be present when a band takes the step into the big league. Friday night was one of these.\" On 2 February, the band finished off a gigging period with a Daytrotter session and a sold out London Borderline gig on a co-headline with We Are Augustines, as the opening gig of the HMV Next Big Thing Festival.

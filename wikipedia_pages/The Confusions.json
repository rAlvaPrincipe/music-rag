    "text": "The Confusions is an indie pop band from Sundsvall, Sweden. The band was formed in the early 1990s. The breakthrough album, \"Everyone's Invited,\" along with \"Six-0-Seven, were produced by Peter Svensson of The Cardigans. In 1997, The Confusions and Massproduktion signed with Stockholm Records, but were quickly released after Stockholm Records was bought by Universal 10.\nThe Confusions formed in 1991 by a gang of childhood friends in the suburb of Skönsberg of Sundsvall – an industrial town in the north, better known for its punk, postpunk and metal scene. But being an outsider can be sometimes be to your advantage. And the band took that chance and developed quick.\nOnly five years later - their second album “Everyone’s Invited” - produced by Peter Svensson from The Cardigans, smashed all the doors open to numerous releases and tours all over the world. It was crowned with the title of “one of this year’s five top album” by Record Collector.\nSome years later a gig at SXSW would open the door for some touring of US and finally also a Nordic MTV no 1 for the video to The Pilot. Things don’t always turn out the way it should, but the band survived all the ups and downs of an indie band, still constantly touring developing and releasing records. Building a bond between the members that is really special.\nAfter a challenging period, the band built a studio in their rehearsal room and 2008 recorded the more than one hour long self-produced album “The Story Behind the Story” that by many was regarded as their finest work and also found a working method by recording and producing in their own studio.\nIn early 2020 the band played two hours show in hometown Sundsvall with tracks from all their 30 years and felt it was time to gather some of the latest releases and combine with the new stuff, the double vinyl album \"Black Silhouettes.\" \nLive they are a stunning band and this album also proves their impressive songwriting skills and passion for their own musical universe. \n The band won the SMA Award for Best Album for 5am at the Fourth Sundsvall Music Awards.\n\n\n== Lineup ==\nMikael Andersson-Knut: lead vocals, songwriter and guitar\nZarah Andersson-Knut: keyboard and backup vocals\nMattias Lofstrom: drums and percussion\nMagnus Thorsell: bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nSplit (1993) (Massproduktion)\nForever (1994)\nCornflake King (1997)\nWindow\nThe Pilot\nDon't Let The World Catch You Crying\nImagination\n Oh God I Think I'm In Love (2014)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nBeing Young (1995)\nBeing Young - Special Edition (1995)\nEveryone's Invited (1996)\nSix-0-Seven (1998) (Stockholm Records)\nTrampoline (2002)\n5am (February 2006)\nIt Sure Looks Like The Confusions But It Sounds More Acoustic (2007)\nThe Story Behind the Story (March 2008)\nA Permanent Marker (November 2009)\nThe Confusions (September 2014)\nBlack Silhouettes (Double vinyl album) (April 2021)\nBlack Silhouettes - The Nuclear Ghosts  (August 2021)\nTOLV  (November 2023)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"All Dressed Up\" (Forever)\n\"Steroid Hearts\" (Everyone's Invited)\n\"Raining Cigarettes\" (Six-0-Seven)\n\"The Pilot\" (Trampoline)\nTonight (Trampoline)\n\"Painted People\" ('The Trampoline)\n\"Artificial\" (5am)\n\"Don't Let The World Catch You Crying\"\n\"Thin\" (The Story Behind the Story)\n\"The Logo\" (The Story Behind the Story)\n\"Strangers\" (The Story Behind the Story)\n\"I Won't Be Sober When This Is Over\" ('A Permanent Marker)\n\"Boys will be Boys\" ('A Permanent Marker)\n\"It's So Quiet, It's So Cold\" (2014 - The Confusions)\n\"Oh God I Think I´m in Love\" (2014 - The Confusions)\n\"Pavement\" (2014 - The Confusions)\n\"Det Är Här Vi Står Idag\" (2015 - Officiell låt till GIF-Sundsvall)\n\"You Spit When You Talk\" (2015)\n\"Varje Ögonblick Vårt Eget\" (2016)\n\"LIPS\" (2018)\n\"LIPS remix by Polygrim\" (2018)\n\"Don't You Fall In Love\" (2018)\n\"I'm Not Afraid / True\" (2018)\n\"So Long\" (2018)\n\"I Wish We Could Swim Now / Are You Breathing Under Water\" (2018)\n\"Sunday Mornings\" (2019)\n\"Close Your Eyes\" (2019)\n\"The Radio\" (Cover for Massproduktion Christmas album) (2019)\n\"Electric\" (2020)\n\"Like Science Fiction\" (2020)\n\"Suburbian Ghosts\" (2020)\n\"Tangerine Sky\" (2021)\n\"Arrow\" (2021)\n\"Into The Twilight\" (2021)\n\"Don't Say That True Love Waits For Everyone\" (2021)\n\"1664\" (2022)\n\"Fell Out Of Bed\" (2022)\n\"You Go!

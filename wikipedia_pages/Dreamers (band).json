    "text": "Dreamers (stylized as DREAMERS) is an American pop rock band, featuring Nick Wold, Marc Nelson and touring members Jessica Goodwin and Ari Tibi.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and first EP (2014) ===\nNick Wold moved from Seattle to New York at the age of 18 to study jazz saxophone at New York University's Steinhardt School. In New York, Wold was the lead singer and guitarist in the grunge band Motive, along with drummer Chris Bagamery, bassist Andrew McGovern, and lead guitarist David Leondi.  McGovern, Bagamery, and Wold were longtime friends from Seattle who grew up playing jazz together.  Wold met Leondi at NYU, and the trio became a quartet. Hailed as \"The Strokes 2.0\", Motive shared the stage with The Vaccines, Walk The Moon, Bear Hands, and were featured on MTV2's show 120 Minutes with Matt Pinfield, The New York Times, NYLON guys, and CBS News.  The band toured the US several times, and had 9 showcases at SXSW in 2013.\nFollowing the dissolution of Motive, Wold was living and writing songs in a Brooklyn rehearsal space. He and Bagamery met bassist Marc Nelson (known only by his surname), and the three teamed up to form the band.\nTheir first single, \"Wolves (You Got Me)\", was released on July 16, 2014, and was in rotation on Sirius XM's Alt Nation. It was included on their self-titled debut EP, produced by Danny Kalb, which was recorded at Ravensworth Studio outside Charlottesville, Virginia, and released on November 18, 2014. The four-track EP was streamed on Billboard a week ahead of its release date. In 2014, Alternative Press named Dreamers one of their 100 Bands You Need To Know.\n\n\n=== You Are Here and This Album Does Not Exist (2015–2016) ===\nIn February 2015, Dreamers signed a deal with Fairfax Recordings. Drummer Jacob Lee Wick joined the band at the end of 2015, replacing Bagamery after they relocated to Los Angeles. That year, the trio started recording tracks with producer Kevin Agunas for their debut LP. On December 3, 2015, they released the video for their second single, \"Shooting Shadows\", off their second EP, You Are Here. The song was written by Wold and Atlas Genius lead singer Keith Jeffery.    On February 5, 2016, You Are Here was released on Fairfax Recordings. It included their first single, \"Wolves (You Got Me)\", their new single \"Drugs\", and three additional tracks. The video for \"Drugs\" premiered on Billboard on March 2, 2016.\nThe first single off their debut LP This Album Does Not Exist was \"Sweet Disaster\", released on June 24, 2016. The album was released on August 26, 2016. Much of the album was written by Wold in Brooklyn before the band's relocation to Los Angeles.\n\n\n=== EPs and Launch Fly Land (2018) ===\nOn July 13, 2018, Dreamers released Launch, a four-song EP. The EP serves as the first of a trilogy of releases. The album cover displays a picture of a SpaceX Falcon 9 at liftoff with a purple hue.\nOn September 7, 2018, Dreamers released Fly, a five-song EP and the second in the trilogy. It features the single \"All Washed Out\" and a stripped-down version of the single \"Screws\".\nOn February 21, 2019, \"Die Happy\" was released as the first single from what fans assumed was a third EP. However, on April 4, 2019, the band announced that their second album, Launch Fly Land, would be released April 26, 2019, which includes \"Die Happy\", and released the second single from the album, \"Insomniac\".\nIn April 2020, Dreamers released a new rendition of their single \"Heat Seeker\" with vocals from Grandson. The solo version is featured in the video game Just Dance 2021.\nOn April 1, 2022, ahead of their release of single \"Black Confetti\", Dreamers announced that drummer Jacob Lee Wick would be leaving the band.\nOn June 2, 2023, the band announced that they would be leaving the Dodging Sunshine tour prematurely due to a family emergency.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nNick Wold – lead vocals, guitar\nMarc Nelson - bass\nJessica Goodwin (touring member) - drummer\nAri Tibi (touring member) - instrumentalist\n\n\n== Performances ==\nDreamers were selected to open for Stone Temple Pilots on their US tour in April and May 2015, at venues including The Fillmore in San Francisco, Aztec Theatre in San Antonio, House of Blues in Chicago, Irving Plaza in New York City and at SunFest in West Palm Beach. They were picked out of 500 bands who submitted to be the opener.\nFrom December 2015 through April 2016, Dreamers went on tour across North America. This included their first foray into Canada, where they co-headlined with Arkells, joining the band onstage to perform a cover of George Harrison's version of \"Got My Mind Set on You\". The bands also covered David Bowie's \"Modern Love\" together, and Dreamers have separately covered Blind Melon's \"No Rain\".\nDreamers have also played with Atlas Genius, Civil Twilight, The Airborne Toxic Event, The Mowgli's, Young Rising Sons, The Vaccines, Weezer, Catfish and the Bottlemen, and All Time Low. They played Lollapalooza 2016 in Chicago, and have also put in appearances at Bumbershoot, Firefly, and Coachella along the way, and they went on a full US tour with The Griswolds in 2017 as well as with Night Riots in support of The Maine later that year. In 2018, they joined New Politics, alongside The Wrecks, on their Lost In Translation tour, named after their third album. In the fall of 2018, Dreamers went on their first US headlining tour with Weathers, Morgxn, and Rad Horror.

River City Rhythm performs in Drum Corps International (DCI) competitions.\n\n\n== History ==\nRiver City Rhythm began as a competitive drumline, founded in Big Lake, Minnesota, in 2009 to compete in the Minnesota Percussion Association (MPA) and Winter Guard International (WGI). The unit has won the MPA Independent A Class Championship in 2010–11 and the MPA Independent Open Class Championship in 2013–16 and 2018–19.

While the management was laying the groundwork for starting a new corps, the drumline was one of seventeen that took part in the DrumLine Battle competition in Indianapolis during the 2014 DCI World Championships. In January 2015, DCI announced that River City Rhythm was one of five corps being evaluated for possible inclusion in DCI Open Class competition for 2015. In May 2015, following a period of evaluation of the unit's finances, staffing, and tour plans by DCI's staff, River City Rhythm was added to the list of competing Open Class corps. The corps was added to DCI's summer schedule for four shows in Minnesota and Iowa in preparation for the corps' first appearance at the DCI Open Class World Championship Prelims in Michigan City, Indiana.\n\n\n== Sponsorship ==\nRiver City Rhythm is a 501 (c)(3) musical organization.

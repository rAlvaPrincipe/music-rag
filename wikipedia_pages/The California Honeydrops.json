    "text": "The California Honeydrops are a blues and R&B band founded by Lech Wierzynski, Nansamba Ssensalo, and Benjamin Malament.\nThe California Honeydrops' music is distinct from other bands due to the piano riffs, bluesy vocals, and a soulful vibe. The band uses some atypical instruments to achieve this including the gutbucket bass, jug, and washboard.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe California Honeydrops was formed in 2007 but Lech Wierzynski, the frontman, had a distinct relationship with music before the band. Wierzynski was born in Poland, but his family immigrated to the United States of America in 1984 when he was 3. Growing up, Wierzynski listened to music of all kinds, which has influenced the music he produces.Wierzynski grew up in Maryland, near Washington D.C., and was where he started to seriously develop his ability to play the trumpet. Before he was in The California Honeydrops, he worked with some artists like Dan Hicks and Jackie Payne.\nThroughout the band's existence members have joined and others have left. Nansamba Ssensalo was dating Wierzynski when the band first started, but eventually left the group. They are also joined by other artists for some concerts but the consistent members include Lech Wierzynski, Benjamin Malament, Yanos “Johnny Bones” Lustig, Lorenzo Loera, and Beaumont Beaullieu.\nTheir first album, Soul Tub!, was released in November 2008 which was a year after the band was formed. Since then, they have gone on tour, performed at music festivals, and released 13 albums total.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSoul Tub!

Skusta Clee, the lead member of O.C. Dawgs, pioneered the Pinoy trap genre, which helped launch the country's mainstream trap movement. Despite being underground at first, O.C. Dawgs dominated Musical.ly in 2016 with the release of \"Kriminal\", the same year the group joined Ex Battalion.\nOn September 18, 2017, \"Hayaan Mo Sila\", their collaboration with Ex Battalion, debuted on the Billboard Philippines Top 20 chart. In their 16th week on the chart, they peaked at #2. On June 18, 2018, their performance of that song on the \"Wish Bus\" of Wish 107.5 was uploaded to Youtube. Two days later, it had topped YouTube PH’s trends list.\nThe O.C. Dawgs have seen phenomenal success with \"Pauwi Nako\", which was released in 2018 under the Panty Droppaz League music label, and has amassed millions of streams on both Spotify and YouTube platforms. Their performance of that song on the \"Wish Bus\" ranked third on YouTube PH's top trending music videos for 2019. It was the fastest video from their channel to hit 10 million YouTube views in no less than two weeks.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Plagiarism ===\nEx Battalion members Skusta Clee and Flow G have been accused of plagiarism for releasing a promotional track entitled \"Deym\" identical to \"Ddaeng\" by BTS in September 2020. The contentious piece sparked heated debate, making #SkustaCleeisGoingtoJailParty a trending topic on Philippine Twitter. A few weeks later, the group's management denied allegations claiming that the two pieces are 'inherently different' and that they used a generic triplet flow. The management also added that \"parallel thinking among artists do happen and it cannot be avoided\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nSkusta Clee – leader, vocalist, rapper\nBullet D – rapper\nJnske – rapper\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nFilipino hip hop\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

The band is recognised as the oldest continuing brass band in the Southern hemisphere, having been established in 1857 (sometimes reported as 1860).\nThe band's instrumentation is in the English traditional brass band format, utilising B♭ cornets, E♭ soprano cornet, B♭ flugel horn, E♭ tenor horns, B♭baritones, B♭ euphoniums, tenor & bass trombones, B♭ and E♭ tubas and percussion. On occasion the band is augmented with a rhythm section of drum kit, guitar, piano, and bass. As a community band the members all volunteer their time and skills, with funds raised through sponsorship and performances directed towards the band's running expenses, purchases of music and instruments, and tuition grants.\nTanunda Town Band is a member of the South Australian Bands Association and competes in a number of competitions and festivals, most notably the South Australian State Championships and the Australian National Band Championships.

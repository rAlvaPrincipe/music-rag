    "text": "GNZ48 is a Chinese idol girl group established in Guangzhou, Guangdong in 2016. It is a sister group of SNH48, belonging to Guangzhou Star48 Culture Media Group Co., Ltd. GNZ48 currently has 51 members (45 regular members and 6 trainees, as of April 19, 2022, information reference from GNZ48 official website.) and is divided into Team G, Team NIII and Team Z. Like SNH48, they follow the AKB48's creator Yasushi Akimoto's concept of \"idols you can meet\".\n\n\n== Overview ==\nGNZ48 is one of the first two sister groups of SNH48 (the other is BEJ48). On April 20, 2016, Star48 Media held a press conference in Beijing to announce the establishment of the SNH48 sister groups BEJ48 and GNZ48, and launched the first phase of the GNZ48 recruitment campaign. GNZ48 officially became a girl idol group. GNZ48 is a girl idol group that conducts performing arts activities in Guangzhou which built on the “idols you can meet” concept by regularly organizing “handshake” events where fans can meet group members. Its theater is located at Zhongtai International Plaza in Tianhe District, Guangzhou, and opened on April 29, 2016. Its name is the abbreviation of \"Guangzhou\" Pinyin name. Its first members included some fifth- and sixth-generation members transferred from SNH48.\nWhen GNZ48 was established, there were two teams, the Team G and Team NIII. Since GNZ48 is a sister group established by SNH48 brokerage company Star48, AKB48 operator AKS has not directly authorized SNH48, so GNZ48 is not included in the AKB48 Group (AKB48 issued a statement on June 9, 2016, that said that GNZ48 has nothing to do with AKB48, nor does it belong to AKB48 Group. The English name of the Team G and the Team NIII are not named in the order of the AKB48 group, but are directly named Team G and Team NIII.

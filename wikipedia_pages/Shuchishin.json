    "text": "Shuchishin (羞恥心, Shūchishin) is a Japanese idol vocal group formed as part of the variety show Quiz! Hexagon II produced by Fuji Television Network Incorporated. Originally meant to be a joke group, the trio has released singles that have hit the top 10 on both the Oricon and the Billboard Japan Hot 100 Singles. Shuchishin, whose name translates as \"Shame\", consists of the leader Takeshi Tsuruno with Naoki Nokubo and Yusuke Kamiji. The group's final performance was on the January 2, 2009, New Year's Special episode of Quiz! Hexagon II. The group's name comes from a mispronunciation of the word when it came up in a question on the show in mid-2007 (the word \"shūchishin\" was pronounced as \"sajishin\" (さじしん) by the members of the band).\nThe group was disbanded in January 2009. Since then, Takeshi Tsuruno and Yusuke Kamiji have pursued solo musical careers, while Naoki Nokubo has returned to drama acting. Tsuruno has released two cover albums and released a single with another Hexagon Family vocal group, and Kamiji recording under the name \"Yusuke\" (written with different kanji than his legal name) has released three singles through the Sony Music Records label. The group also reunited to record a song with all of the Hexagon Family artists.\n\n\n== Members ==\nShu (羞, Shū, ■)\nTakeshi Tsuruno (つるの 剛士, Tsuruno Takeshi), represented by Ohta Production, is the leader of the group.

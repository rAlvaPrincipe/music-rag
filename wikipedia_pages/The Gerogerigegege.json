    "text": "The Gerogerigegege (ザ・ゲロゲリゲゲゲ) (Japanese pronunciation: [za ɡeɾo ɡeɾi ɡeɡeɡe]) (derived from Japanese terms for vomiting, diarrhea and onomatopoeia for an expression of disgust) is a Japanese experimental music project, founded in 1985 by Juntaro Yamanouchi (山ノ内純太郎, Yamanouchi Juntarō). \nThough they are often categorized with Japanese harsh noise acts such as Merzbow and Masonna, The Gerogerigegege has also released albums of more straightforward punk rock (Sexual Behavior in the Human Male), noise (45 RPM Performance), and ambient music (None Friendly, Endless Humiliation), in addition to several seven inch records mixing these styles with found recordings. The group is known for their 1990 album Tokyo Anal Dynamite, a 75-track live album drawing from noisecore, noise and hardcore punk.\nDespite limited coverage during their initial run, due in part to the material's extreme sound and vulgar subject matter, their music has since garnered a cult following. Juntaro Yamanouchi also ran the Vis a Vis record label.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Gerogerigegege was founded by Juntaro Yamanouchi in 1985, and their first performances took place in S&M clubs. Their first performance outside of said clubs took place at the auditorium of Waseda University in October 1986.\nOver the years, The Gerogerigegege has included many members, the most notable and consistent other than Yamanouchi being Gero 30 (aka Gero 56, real name Tetsuya Endoh), an exhibitionist known to masturbate onstage during live performances. Male masturbation is called Senzuri (千擦り, \"a thousand rubs\") in Japanese and was Gero 30's trademark. Other members have included Toshinori Fukuda (aka Dynamite Gero) on drums, Hironao Komaki (Dee Dee Gero) on guitar, Junko Katoh (Gero Grace Seijoh), their live manager, and Masatoshi Katsuya (Gero Route 66), the band's driver.\nThe Gerogerigegege is known for their releasing records with unusual concepts, such as 1989's Showa (昭和) released after the death of Hirohito, which bookended a recording of people having sex to \"Kimigayo\", the Japanese national anthem. A special edition of Showa falsely presented itself as a Ramones bootleg called Britzkrieg '75 (Demo Tracks), with no mention of Gerogerigegege or Showa anywhere on the release. The Night 7″ features a recording of a man defecating into a toilet after the usual \"one, two, three, four\" count. The compilation album Recollections of Primary Masturbation contains 338 songs, including the entirety of Tokyo Anal Dynamite as one track.\nThere are also some non-musical conceptual releases including Shaking Box Music: You Are the Noise Maker, which consists of 100 blank cassettes in a large metal box. This Is Shaking Box Music Part 2, which is a destroyed copy of the Mother Fellatio EP in a cassette case. Art Is Over consists of a single octopus tentacle housed in a cassette box. These non-music releases were typically released in even smaller quantities than the music releases, in quantities of 50 or less. Similar concepts are rampant throughout the band's catalog, and often, the more ridiculous the theme or packaging of a release is, the more sought after it is by collectors. Copies of some Gerogerigegege records sell for hundreds of US dollars.\nFollowing the release of Saturday Night Big Cock Salaryman in 2001, The Gerogerigegege became inactive. Yamanouchi had seemingly disappeared and people who had dealings with The Gerogerigegege had no idea on how to contact him. Rumors proliferated regarding his fate, often driven by speculation based on the group's musical output. On 27 August 2013, a Twitter post from Gidayū Kaitai (解体義太夫) stated that he had been contacted by Yamanouchi.\nThe first release from Gerogerigegege in 15 years, Moenai Hai (燃えない灰), was released on 20 April 2016 by Eskimo Records in Japan. This was followed up in 2019 with Uguisudani Apocalypse.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nStudio and Live (as The Gero-P) (1985)\nThe Gerogerigegege (1985)\nSenzuri Champion (1987)\nShowa (昭和) (1988)\nTokyo Anal Dynamite (1990)\nLive Greatest Hits (1991)\nSenzuri Power Up (1991)\n45RPM Performance (1992)\nHotel Ultra (1993)\nNothing to Hear, Nothing to... 1985 (1993)\nEndless Humiliation (1994)\nInstruments Disorder (1994)\nPiano River (1995)\nMort Douce Live (1996)\nHell Driver (1999)\nNone Friendly (1999)\nRRRecycled Music (~1999)\nSaturday Night Big Cock Salaryman (2001)\n燃えない灰 (Moenai Hai) (2016)\nUguisudani Apocalypse (2019)\nPiano River (2019)\nGig In Train Blackout Archive V.2 (2019)\nGig In Train Blackout Archive V.3 (2019)\n三条の滝 Blackout Archive V.4 (2019)\nPiss Shower Girlfriend (2020)\n>(decrescendo) (2020)\n直美のオナニーと若草寮案内 RE-ISSUE (2021)\nHand Made Broken Orgel (2022)\n新宿に命さびしむ歌多し (2022)\n>(decrescendo) Final Chapter (2022)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nSexual Behavior in the Human Male (1988)\nAll My Best, with Love Juntaro (~1990)\nWilliam Bennett Is My Dick (~1990)\nNo Sound (~1990)\nMore Shit E.P.

    "text": "Ocie Elliott is a Canadian folk music duo from Victoria, British Columbia. They are composed of Jon Middleton, who is also vocalist and guitarist in the band Jon and Roy, and Sierra Lundy. They were nominated for the Juno Award for Breakthrough Group of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2022. They have released 9 albums and EPs.\nThe band got its name after Middleton, inspired by Lundy's obsession with the 1920s, found the name \"Ocie Cleve\" in a 1920s name generator and combined it with the first name of folk singer Elliott Smith.\n\n\n== History ==\nAs a child, Lundy sang in the school choir, although she was more focused on sports. Her dad, however, wanted her to become a musician. Lundy attended art school in Victoria. Middleton's father played acoustic guitar often on camping trips and also inspired his interest in music.\nThey met and began dating in 2016, when Middleton performed solo at a cafe on Salt Spring Island in which Lundy was working.\nA month into their relationship, Lundy's sister and a friend insisted that Middleton and Lundy perform together. They immediately performed a rendition of \"Look at Miss Ohio\" by Gillian Welch and felt a connection and synergy. For their first couple years together, they only performed cover versions of about 50 songs in coffee shops and restaurants. Artists whose songs they performed include Simon & Garfunkel, John Prine, Milky Chance, and Beach House.\nThey released a self-titled EP in 2017. In early 2019, they signed a recording contract with Vancouver-based Nettwerk Music Group.\nTheir song \"Run to You\" was included in a 2019 episode of Grey's Anatomy and their song \"The Less We Know\" was included in a 2022 episode of the show.\n\n\n== Ecological activism ==\nThe band tries to minimize its ecological footprint by not creating much merchandise. They also take trains as much as possible instead of driving.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nThe duo cite Bob Dylan and Simon & Garfunkel as their biggest influences.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nOcie Elliott (September 22, 2017)\nWe Fall In (February 8, 2019)\nIn That Room (March 20, 2020)\nTracks (July 17, 2020)\nSlow Tide (March 12, 2021)\nA Place (August 27, 2021)\nWith the Lights Down (February 25, 2022)\nWhat Remains (September 23, 2022)\nKnow The Night (November 24, 2023)\n\n\n== References =="

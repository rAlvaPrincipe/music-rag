    "text": "Autumn Tears is an international dark wave band formed in September 1995 by Erika Swinnich and Ted Tringo. Their music has characteristics of gothic rock and industrial rock, utilizing operatic orchestration in lieu of more conventional rock instrumentation.\n\n\n== History ==\nAutumn Tears was established in September 1995 by keyboardist and pianist Ted Tringo. The group's debut album, Love Poems for Dying Children - Act I was released in April 1996. This album featured symphonic arrangements influenced by ancient chants, classical music, and contemporary artists such as Dead Can Dance, Anchorage, Stoa, and Enya. The initial tracks for the album were recorded at West Record Studios, motivating Tringo to release music independently through his own label, Dark Symphonies. \nIn May 1997, Autumn Tears released their follow-up album, Love Poems for Dying Children...Act II: The Garden of Crystalline Dreams.\nOriginally, the initial release of Act I was slated to be a limited run of 2000 copies. However, in response to an unexpected surge of demand, a decision was made to reissue it in 1998. This re-release featured a revamped layout and artwork, accompanied by remixed and remastered tracks. Notably, the repress introduced a bonus track titled \"The Intermission,\" notable for marking Jennifer Judd's inaugural vocal contribution to the band.\nIn 1999, Autumn Tears unveiled a mini-LP named Absolution, which was followed by their third and concluding full-length album of the Love Poems trilogy in 2000, titled Love Poems for Dying Children - Act III - Winter and the Broken Angel. \nIn 2004, the band embarked on the production of their fifth album, Eclipse. This marked a notable expansion in their musical horizons as they welcomed new talents into their fold. Among these additions was Laurie Ann Haus, a female vocalist whose harmonies complemented lead vocalist Erica Swinnich Tandy across the majority of the album's tracks.\nIn 2007, Autumn Tears released The Hallowing, sparking speculation among listeners about the future of the band. The uncertainty surrounding their trajectory was addressed in the liner notes of the 2008 re-issue of Love Poems - Act I, where it was clarified that the band hadn't disbanded but was rather taking a hiatus. \nIn 2018, the band made a notable return with an EP titled The Origin of Sleep. Collaborating with talents like Irish harpist Brona McVittie, Tom Moth, John Clark, Terran Olson, and Jennifer Judd, the EP showcased Autumn Tears' dedication to their craft. Mastered by Peter Bjärgö at Erebus Odora studio, the EP marked a significant milestone for the band.\nThe anticipation for Autumn Tears' resurgence was fulfilled in 2019 with the release of Colors Hidden Within The Gray, their first full-length album in over a decade. Boasting a grand orchestral ensemble comprising over 30 musicians, including some from the previous EP, the album was a testament to the band's enduring creativity. Ethnic instruments such as bagpipes, kamancheh, and bansuri enriched the sonic landscape, adding depth to their musical tapestry.\nReleased in 2020, a subsequent album emerged under the title The Air Below The Water, manifesting as a double CD compilation. Encompassing a diverse array of talent, the album featured over 40 musicians and vocalists, among them the esteemed opera singer Caroline Joy Clarke, singer-songwriter Tamar Singer, and vocal coach Anne \"Anaé\" Laurent. Noteworthy returning contributors included singer-songwriters Brona McVittie and Nathan Nasby. The album's sonic landscape was enriched by the inclusion of an orchestral classical ensemble alongside an assortment of ethnic instruments such as the kamancheh, bansuri, and duduk.\nIn March 2021, Autumn Tears unveiled their ninth full-length album, The Glow of Desperation, coinciding with International Women's Day. The album was made available as a limited CD and through digital download channels. Notably, the CD includes a lyric booklet adorned with striking illustrations by artist Marcela Bolívar.\nIn February 2022, Autumn Tears collaborated with Zeresh for a split album titled Widowing. The album comprised 7 tracks from Autumn Tears and 6 from Zeresh, with the cover artwork crafted by the acclaimed artist Marcela Bolívar.\nMarch 2023 marked the release of Guardian of the Pale under The Circle Music label.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current lineup ===\nTed Tringo – Composition, arrangements, lyrics, piano:\nCaroline Joy Clarke – Lead and backing vocals, vocal and lyric arrangements\nDarren Clarke – Lead and backing vocals, vocal and lyric arrangements\nTamar Singer – Lead and backing vocals, vocal and lyric arrangements\nAnne \"Anaé\" Laurent – Lead and backing vocals, vocal and lyric arrangements\nAgnete Mangnes Kirkevaag – Lead and backing vocals, vocal and lyric arrangements\nAnn–Mari Edvardsen Alexis – Lead and backing vocals, vocal and lyric arrangements\nDawn Desireé Smith – Lead and backing vocals, vocal and lyric arrangements\nBróna Mcvittie – Lead and backing vocals, vocal and lyric arrangements\nNathan Nasby – Lead and backing vocals, vocal and lyric arrangements\nFfion Elisa Williams – Lead vocals and vocal arrangements\nSoroush Abedi – Composition, accompaniment, arrangements and percussion\nArtur Silveiro – Composition, accompaniment, arrangements and percussion\nJess Townsend – Violin, viola\nTom McCluskey – Cello\nSanja Smileska – Violin, viola\nSanja Smileska – Viola\nMercedes Bralo – Harp\nVal Cortoni – Hammered dulcimer\nKelly O'Donohue – Trumpet, trombone\nOli Parker – Trumpet\nMatt Giella – Trumpet\nJosué García García – Trumpet\nMaría Gabriela Soto – Trombone\nAustris Apenis – French horn\nClaude Lumley – French horn\nGiulia Cacciavillani – Flute, piccolo\nAlia Fay – Wooden traverse flute, tin whistle\nSasko Temelkoski – Clarinet\nCarolina Prado Sánchez – Oboe\nCallum Edwards – Snare drum\n\n\n=== Past members ===\n(1995–2004) Erika (Swinnich) Tandy – Lead and backing vocals, composition and keyboards.\n(1998–2001) Jennifer LeeAnna – Lead and backing vocals, vocal arrangements, composition and keyboards.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nLove Poems for Dying Children - Act I (1996)\nLove Poems for Dying Children...

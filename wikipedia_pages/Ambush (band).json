    "text": "Ambush is a Canadian country music group, formed in 1993, and based in Ottawa.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe original line-up (from 1993 to 1999) consisted of Skip Layton (drums), Jef Leeson (bass guitar and lead vocals) and Mark McDonell (guitar and vocals). They met while working as the back-up band for Ottawa singer Dennis Whitty, and derived the name Ambush from the name of Whitty's backing band, 'Bushwacker'. \nThis line-up recorded three albums of cover songs: On Stage in 1993, Hard to Say No in 1994, and Kickin' Up a Fuss in 1995. All were produced by Leeson and released on his independent label Chancellor Music. \nThrough 1996, they recorded their first CD of original music in Nashville, with producer-writer Cyril Rawson. The CD, Ambush, yielded modest regional hits with \"Since She Got Back From Texas\" and \"Girls Like That\". \nIn 1997, a 3-track CD featuring the songs \"Let's Go Crazy Girl\", \"Since She Got Back From Texas\" and \"Don't Let It Hit You on the Way Out\" (all originally from their 1996 debut CD) was released, which included new vocals and remixes by Chad Irschick at Inception Sound Studios in Toronto.\nLeeson left the band in November 1999 to pursue a solo career. He was replaced by Glenn Desjardine who, in November 2001, was replaced by Riq Turner. Riq departed in 2014, and was replaced by Kris Lafontaine. Skip Layton departed in October 2005; he was replaced by Jim Wright. Wright left the band in October 2011; he was replaced by Tom VanCoughnett. VanCoughnett departed in 2015; Dan Killen joined the band as a touring/session member until 2016, when he was replaced by Danny Derue. In 2002, Ambush signed with Longshot Records.\nIn 2006 Ambush won the CMT reality series Plucked. They shot videos for their songs \"This Could Be The Night\" and \"In This Room\" during the series.\nIn 2006, the band released a studio album entitled I Wanna Go Home With You. This album included singles such as \"This Could Be The Night\", \"Too Hot For Words\" and \"Anything To Rock You\". \nAt the 2007 Canadian Country Music Awards (CCMA Awards), the band was nominated as Group of the Year. They received the same nomination in 2008. At the latter ceremony, the \"In This Room\" video was nominated as Video of the Year.\nAmbush has released seven live albums, most recently in 2016, with Ambush Live Off the Floor. They last toured in 2019, traveling to the UK to play the Tokyo World Festival and the Wireless Festival. As of 2021, the band remains active.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nAlbums\n\nOn Stage (1993), Chancellor\nHard to Say No (1994), Chancellor\nKickin' Up a Fuss (1995), Chancellor\nAmbush (1996), Chancellor\nLive (2002), Independent\nAmbush Live II (2003), Longshot Records\nI Wanna Go Home with You (2006), Independent\nAmbush Live: Three (2007), Longshot Records\nLive 4 (2008), Longshot Records\nAmbush (2009), 306 Records\nAmbush Classics (2009), Longshot Records\nAmbush Live in Cuba (2013), Longshot Records\nAmbush For Kidz!

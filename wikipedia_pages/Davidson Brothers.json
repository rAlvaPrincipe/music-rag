    "text": "The Davidson Brothers are an Australian bluegrass and country music duo. Originally from Yinnar, Victoria, the brothers are Hamish and Lachlan Davidson. They have written and performed together since their youth, and \"are multi-instrumentalists on banjo, fiddle, and mandolin and have won many awards on the country circuit\". They released their first album, Blue Spruce, in 1999 when they were both in their early teens. This was the beginning of what would span into numerous recordings and national awards. \"With their dynamic brand of classic bluegrass and more contemporary newgrass music, the pair has not only blitzed the Australian country music industry, but has attracted plenty of attention in the United States and Europe as well.\"\nWhile they have toured extensively as the Davidson Brothers, they have also shared the stage with many well-known Australian artists including Andrew Farriss, Lee Kernaghan, Troy Cassar-Daley, Beccy Cole, Melinda Schneider, Sara Storer, Joy McKean, Anne Kirkpatrick and Hugh McDonald. They have entertained troops in the Middle East, made regular appearances on national television (Hey Hey It's Saturday, Good Morning Australia, The Panel, Spicks and Specks) and played on many recording sessions with a range of other artists (Smoky Dawson, Kevin Bloody Wilson, Joe Camilleri, Bruce Rowland).\nSince completing university the Davidson Brothers have made Bendigo, Victoria, their home and split their time between music and their other interests. They were among the Top 10 Most Outstanding Musicians in the 2010 Melbourne Prize. In 2011, the brothers established the Australian Youth Bluegrass Scholarship to encourage and nurture singers and musicians who demonstrate exceptional talent and dedication in the field of Bluegrass Music.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1999: Blue Spruce ===\nHamish and Lachlan recorded Blue Spruce with Andrew Clermont in 1998 at the Davidson family home in Yinnar Victoria.

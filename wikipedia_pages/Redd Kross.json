    "text": "Redd Kross is an American rock band from Hawthorne, California, who had their roots in 1978 in a punk rock band called the Tourists, which was started by brothers Jeff and Steve McDonald while Steve was still in middle school. With the addition of friends Greg Hetson and John Stielow on drums, the band's first gig was opening for Black Flag. The band has since released eight albums and three EPs.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Red Cross ===\nIn April 1979, the band had their first practice in the living room of original drummer, John Stielow's parent's home. They eventually changed the band name to Red Cross, which was allegedly inspired by the masturbation scene in the film The Exorcist. They soon began working on their 1980 debut self-titled EP.   Eventually, Hetson left to join the Circle Jerks (and later Bad Religion) and Reyes left for Black Flag. They appeared on the Posh Boy compilation The Siren, and then to complete the lineup on their first full-length album, Born Innocent, they assembled a revolving door of musicians including original drummer John Stielow. Full of the brothers' pop culture obsessions, Born Innocent featured odes to Linda Blair (who starred in a television movie of the same name), a cover of \"Look on Up from the Bottom\" by the Carrie Nations from Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, and Charles Manson (whose song \"Cease to Exist\" they covered). The album also contains nods to Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, Tatum O'Neal, and Lita Ford. Not long after the release of the album, the group was threatened with a lawsuit from the International Red Cross and changed the spelling of their name to Redd Kross.\n\n\n=== Redd Kross ===\nIn 1984, Redd Kross returned with drummer Dave Peterson to record Teen Babes from Monsanto, an album featuring covers. Later that year, lead guitarist Robert Hecker joined the band, as they embarked on tour in support of Teen Babes from Monsanto. In that same year, they were featured on the soundtrack of Desperate Teenage Lovedolls with their cover of the Brady Bunch Kids' \"It's a Sunshine Day\".\nIn 1987, Redd Kross released Neurotica.\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nOn February 20, 1990, Redd Kross appeared on Episode 2 of the cult Public-access television show \"Decoupage\"  with Summer Caprice.\nIn 1990, Redd Kross signed with Atlantic Records, releasing Third Eye, and appeared with David Cassidy in the film Spirit of '76, and issued several singles, including \"Annie's Gone\", which had some mild success on college radio.\nThe album Phaseshifter was released in 1993, with new band members Eddie Kurdziel, Gere Fennelly, and Brian Reitzell. The videos for \"Jimmy's Fantasy\" and \"Lady In The Front Row\" were both shown on MTV's 120 Minutes. They toured on Phaseshifter for over a year, headlining their own shows as well as tours supporting The Lemonheads and The Spin Doctors in late 1993 and Stone Temple Pilots in 1994.\nIn 1997, Redd Kross released Show World, produced by Chris Shaw (who also produced albums for Weezer and Soul Asylum) and toured supporting The Presidents of the United States of America.  The band took an indefinite hiatus after the Show World tour, and their future was uncertain after the death of guitarist Eddie Kurdziel on June 6, 1999.\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\nIn 2019, Emmy Award-winning television comedy writer Andrew Reich, best known as an Executive Producer on Friends, was directing a documentary on the band called Born Innocent: The Redd Kross Story.\n\n\n=== 2020s ===\nOn June 26, 2020, the band reissued their debut EP on Merge Records.\nSteven McDonald and Redd Kross were included in a feature article for the 25th anniversary of TapeOp magazine.\nThe documentary Born Innocent: The Redd Kross Story received its Los Angeles premiere at the Don't Knock the Rock Festival on May 23, 2024.\nOn June 28, 2024, Redd Kross released its 8th studio album, a self-titled double album, featuring singles \"Candy Coloured Catastrophe\" and \"Too Good to Be True.\"\nThe brothers released a memoir, Now You’re One of Us: The Incredible Story of Redd Kross, in October 2024, co-written with Dan Epstein and published by Omnibus Press.\n\n\n== Side projects ==\nThe McDonald brothers collaborated with Astrid McDonald (Jeff's daughter with Charlotte Caffey, guitarist for The Go-Go's) and Anna Waronker (Steve's wife, frontwoman of That Dog) on a side project. Performing as Ze Malibu Kids, they released the album Sound It Out in 2002.\nBoth McDonald brothers appeared with David Cassidy in the comedy film The Spirit of '76.\n\n\n== Soundtracks ==\nRedd Kross songs appear on the soundtracks to Desperate Teenage Lovedolls, Good Burger, PCU, Bordello of Blood, An American Werewolf in Paris, and Varsity Blues.  Their song \"1976\" plays over the end credits of the 1990 movie Spirit of '76. They contributed one song \"It's a Scream\" for the 2000 film Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday The Thirteenth but the soundtrack was never released and the song itself wasn't heard until it appeared on Hot Issue in 2016. The song \"Uglier\" was licensed and used in the film Hits by David Cross.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nRed Cross (Posh Boy) (1980)\nTeen Babes from Monsanto (Gasatanka) (1984)\n2500 Redd Kross Fans Can't Be Wrong (Sympathy for the Record Industry) (1993)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nHot Issue (Redd Kross Fashion Records) (2016)\nOh Canada!

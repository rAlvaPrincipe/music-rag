    "text": "Lexington Bridge or otherwise known as LXB was put together in mid-2006 as a boy band by Universal Music after a worldwide search. The group consists of Rob Uncles from the US, Nye Oakley, Dax O'Callaghan and Jerome Simeon from Great Britain and Ephraïm Beks from the Netherlands.\nThey owe their name to Lexington Avenue in New York City. On the other hand, Bridge alludes to the different countries, cultures, styles of the members and the musical elements such as pop, hip-hop, R&B, and Dance which they bridge together through the art of their music.\nMusically, the five singers used elements from contemporary R&B, hip-hop, and pop.\n\n\n== Members ==\nRobert Alexander Uncles (born 17 June 1987 in Los Angeles, USA)\nEphraïm Gideon Nathan Beks (born 27 September 1989 in Alkmaar, the Netherlands)\nDax Jordache O'Callaghan (born 2 July 1986 in London, England)\nNye Oakley (born 6 July 1985 in Ipswich, England)\nJerome Paisley Simeon (born 20 February 1985 in Sheffield, England)\nEach member of the band brought his own unique style and subculture into the band.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2006, after a worldwide casting process with more than 5000 people from all over the world, Lexington Bridge was formed.\nThey became known in spring 2007 with their debut single \"Kick Back\".\nOn October 12, 2007, the second single \"Real Man\" came out in collaboration with the American rapper Snoop Dogg.\nOn November 23, 2007, they released their first album The Vibe. For their debut album, the band worked together with the top-of-the-line songwriters and producers such as Tim Hawes, (Sugababes, Atomic Kitten), Anthony President (Pink, Janet Jackson, Jamie Foxx), Qura Rankin (Christina Aguilera, Usher, Jennifer Lopez, Rihanna) and Marek Pompetzki & Paul NZA (Shaggy, Sido) and recorded their tracks in places including New York, Stockholm, Denmark, Berlin and Los Angeles.\nLexington Bridge was particularly successful on the European continent. In Germany, the band members achieved particular fame when they played as special guests on the Temptation Tour of Monrose. They also made it into the charts in countries such as Poland (top 5) and Bulgaria.\nIn early 2008, band member Nye, who was diagnosed with bulimia, took a break from the band until the beginning of June. In the summer he rejoined the band.\nThis was followed by a Europe-wide campaign for the young fashion company New Yorker. Lexington Bridge members were used as models for the fall 2008 campaign and for several months of advertisements and posters across Europe.\nTheir third single \"Dance with Me\" (in the Gold Edition) was released on October 24, 2008, and entered the German charts at number 20. The single also contains the Charity Foundation remix of \"Go On and Go\" and a rock version of this song because it was originally intended as a single.\nOn 25 May 2010 it was announced that the band had split.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2007: The Vibe\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial MySpace"

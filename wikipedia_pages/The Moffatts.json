Scott was born on March 30, 1983, in Whitehorse, Yukon, and triplets Bob, Clint and Dave were born 11 months later in Vancouver, British Columbia, on March 8, 1984. Bob and Clint are identical twins, while Dave is a fraternal triplet.\nThe band began as a country music vocal group during their childhood and released three records under Polydor Nashville: It's a Wonderful World (1993), The Moffatts (1995), and A Moffatt Christmas (1996). At the time, it was said that they were the youngest band to ever sign a major label recording contract. They released their first pop album Chapter I: A New Beginning (1998). They released one more album Submodalities in 2000 before disbanding in 2001. The band reunited for a one-off online Christmas show on December 22, 2012, on Stageit. In February 2017, Scott, Bob and Clint Moffatt embarked on an extensive promotional tour in Asia for The Moffatts Farewell Tour before being rejoined by Dave in 2018 for the second leg of the Reunion Tour.\nBob and Clint have formed a duo called Music Travel Love.\n\n\n== Members ==\nScott Andrew Moffatt: lead vocals, guitars\nClinton Thomas John \"Clint\" Moffatt: backing vocals, bass, percussion\nRobert Franklin Peter \"Bob\" Moffatt: backing vocals, drums, congas\nDavid Michael William \"Dave\" Moffatt: lead vocals, keyboards\n\n\n== Musical career ==\n\n\n=== 1987–1997: Early years and country albums ===\nThe Moffatts consists of Scott Moffatt and his brothers Bob, Clint, and Dave, who are triplets.\nGrowing up in Faro, Yukon, Tumbler Ridge and later Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, the Moffatts learned to sing early in their lives. Their first recording was at Studio 86 in West Edmonton Mall, where they sang the song \"Grandpa\" by the Judds in 1987. They began singing country music with their mother, Darlana and father, Frank Moffatt. The boys first appearing on-stage in 1988 at the Timmy's Springtime Telethon. In 1992, after performing at a number of large-scale country music festivals, the group was nominated for five awards by the British Columbia Country Music Association.\nIn 1992, the Moffatt family moved to Branson, Missouri where they performed with The Osmonds at the Osmonds Family Theatre. In March 1993 they moved to Nashville, Tennessee where they became regulars on TNN's Nashville Now with Ralph Emery. In October, they joined the cast of the Country Tonite Show at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. In 1994 Country Tonite opened a new theatre in Branson and the Moffatts became a part of that cast. In 1995, they appeared on Good Morning America and performed \"Guns of Love\". In 1996, their parents divorced and they lived primarily with their father, who also managed the group until their 2001 break up.\n\n\n=== 1998–2000: Chapter I: A New Beginning and Submodalities ===\nIn their teens, the group dropped out of the country music genre and recorded a new album, Chapter I: A New Beginning, and began singing pop/rock music. Prior to their teenage years the band would only sparingly perform their own instruments and had a back-up band, but now chose to do it alone with Scott on lead guitar, Clint on bass guitar, Dave on keyboards and Bob on drums. Lead vocals on the album were shared between Scott and Dave, however live they all took their turns. Chapter One sold more than six million copies worldwide and went double platinum in their native Canada. Many industry insiders say that the band sold that many again on the black market in Asia. Chapter One was also very popular in Europe. It was produced in part by the Berman Brothers (who also worked for Hanson and Real McCoy) in New York City and Toronto. The Ottawa-based radio station Hot 89.9 declared them the best new band of 1998.\nOne single on the US version of Chapter One, the Glen Ballard-produced \"Until You Loved Me\", appeared in the Drew Barrymore film, Never Been Kissed. \"Misery\", on the US version of Chapter I: A New Beginning is on the soundtrack of the movie Teaching Mrs. Tingle starring Katie Holmes. In 1999, the band appeared on the NBC TV show Hang Time, performing the song \"Girl of My Dreams\" for the school. In the same year, The Moffatts also did an episode of TV show Campbell Scramble, a show that Calgary's CTV sports newscaster Glenn Campbell made featuring his three daughters Kate, Maddy, and Amy Campbell. That year, the band performed at the Juno Awards show in Hamilton.\nIn 2000, they appeared on the Disney Channel show So Weird in the episode \"Destiny\". The Moffatts also appeared frequently on The Sally Jessy Raphael Show and The Maury Povich Show. During their stay in Köln, Germany, The Moffatts met a young German guitar player, and German teen idol Gil Ofarim and co-wrote with him what was to be his breakout first single, \"If You Only Knew\". The Moffatts sang O Canada at the 1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In 1999 The Moffatts were awarded Fan Favourite Band of the Year at the iHeartRadio Much Music Video Awards.\nThe follow-up album Submodalities was released in October 2000, and contained a more classic/harder-edged rock flavor than typical \"boy band\" fare. The transition between the bubblegum pop of their prior album and the harder edge of the new was captured in the 2001 documentary, The Moffatts: Closing of Chapter One. The Moffatts wrote or co-wrote almost all of the songs on the album. Bob Rock, who has produced albums for such superstars as Metallica and Bon Jovi, produced Submodalities. The album was also certified platinum by the CRIA for selling over 100,000 copies. The first single, \"Bang Bang Boom\" at that time was the fastest rising single to No. 1 in Canadian music history and topped the retail singles chart in Canada. The Moffatts sang O Canada at the 2000 NBA All-Star Game. The Moffatts hosted the Juno Awards of 2000.\nFrom 1998 to 2000 The Moffatts were one of the biggest selling act in South East Asia. The band stayed at the top of the charts in the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Indonesia throughout this period of time. They also completed a couple of firsts - The band shared the stage with Aqua for the first ever paid concert by an international artist in Shanghai, China, and the first ever out door stadium show in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. At the time The Moffatts were the biggest selling international band of all time in the Philippines, a title they will likely never relinquish as record sales are now a thing of the past.\n\n\n=== 2001–2011: Breakup and post-breakup ventures ===\nOn August 25, 2001, the group broke up following their concert in London, Ontario. Thirteen years of touring, over 5,000 concerts, different tastes in music, and the fact that they were all now 18 years of age weighed heavy on their decisions to go their own way.\nAfter the break-up, Bob and Clint Moffatt briefly joined a group called Pusch and performed at the 2002 Winter Olympics. The band was later renamed Hidell, and lasted slightly over a year and released one album, which featured the single Going Down In Flames.

A video interview with Scott Moffatt from the Holiday Train show in Sparwood, BC on December 13, 2005 indicated that he planned to go solo and was recording in LA. On April 10, 2006, song previews from the upcoming independent release The Allegory of the City were put up on his music page along with the promise of a limited edition version soon being available for pre order. Scott has been credited as the producer that opened the door for Thailand's biggest rock band Slot Machine.\nDave Moffatt eventually relocated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, at first with aspirations of attending the University of Winnipeg and then deciding to launch an acting and modeling career. Dave appeared in a 2005 Winnipeg production of Miss Saigon and was a contestant on Canadian Idol, making it into the top 32 before being eliminated.\n\n\n=== 2012: Reunion ===\nBeginning November 2012, The Moffatts were featured in LG's online campaign, \"Life's Good\". The campaign features their song \"Bang Bang Boom\" with altered composition and lyrics.\nThe Moffatts reunited for the first time in over ten years for an online Christmas show on Stageit on December 22, 2012.

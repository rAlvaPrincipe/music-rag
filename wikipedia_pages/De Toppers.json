Gordon Heuckeroth, one of the founding members, left the group in 2011. The group has performed a series of concerts every year since 2005 in the Johan Cruyff Arena. Their repertoire consists mainly of a mix of covers and original material. Toppers in Concert, with more than 40 sold-out shows, is the longest running concert series in the Benelux. In 2008, the Toppers were selected to represent the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 held in Moscow, Russia, with the song \"Shine\".

They performed as a quartet before Heuckeroth departed in 2011.\nIn September 2016, Jan Smit stated he was interested in joining the group. A few hours later, van der Boom posted a video on Facebook of himself and Joling \"auditioning\" to join the band. Smit's addition was formally announced on February 21, 2017.\nIn 2017, the Toppers received a Special Achievement Award, selling more than 1.5 million copies of Toppers in Concert (CD + DVD).

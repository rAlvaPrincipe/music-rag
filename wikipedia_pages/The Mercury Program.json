    "text": "The Mercury Program is an American musical group composed of Dave Lebleu on drums, Sander Travisano on bass guitar, Tom Reno on guitar, and Whit Travisano on vibraphone and piano.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first three members formed a trio in August 1997 and Whit Travisano joined in late 1999. Originally based in Gainesville, Florida, the band members live in different cities across the United States.\nMercury Program's first two albums feature sparse, spoken-word vocals. However, beginning with the release of the 2001 EP All the Suits Began to Fall Off, the band moved to an entirely instrumental format.\nThe band toured extensively in support of their critically acclaimed 2002 album A Data Learn the Language. Then, following the release of the split EP Confines of Heat in 2003, the Mercury Program went on extended hiatus, sporadically working on new material over the next several years. Since then, the band has reconvened occasionally to record, release and tour. Chez Viking was released November 24, 2009, and on May 20, 2016, the band released the EP New Myths, both on Lovitt Records.\nIn 2018, A Data Learn the Language was recut and reissued as a double LP on vinyl.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\nThe Mercury Program (Tiger Style, 1999)\nFrom The Vapor of Gasoline (Tiger Style, 2000)\nA Data Learn the Language (Tiger Style, 2002)\nChez Viking (Lovitt Records, 2009)\nEPs\nAll the Suits Began to Fall Off (Boxcar, 2001)\nConfines of Heat (split release with Maserati + DVD, Kindercore, 2003)\nNew Myths (Lovitt Records, 2016)\nCompilation Appearances\nBack To Donut!

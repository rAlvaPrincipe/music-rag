    "text": "Numéro# is a French Canadian electropop duo consisting of Jérôme Rocipon and Pierre Crube.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJérôme Rocipon is a native of Bordeaux, France and played as a guitarist in various rock groups in the country with additional interests in hip hop.  He started to correspond with Pierre Crube, a composer of experimental electronic music from Montreal in the primarily Francophone province of Quebec in Canada.  The two exchanged their compositions on the Internet.  From this exchange, the project Numéro# was born, and their compositions were put online on MySpace.\nTheir debut album, L'Idéologie des stars, was released in 2006 on the Montreal-based independent label Saboteur Musique. The duo performed heavily, including notably opening up for TTC.  A single, \"Hit pop\", started to receive play on commercial top 40 radio, which is unusual for an independent group.\nThe band's second single, \"Chewing-Gum Fraise\", is their biggest hit in Canada, mostly Quebec. The song's video was the #2 video of the year on MusiquePlus.\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\nThe rap group Omnikrom appeared on the album L'Idéologie des stars in one of the versions of their single \"Chewing-gum fraise\".  In the spring of 2007, Numéro# returned the favour and collaborated with Omnikrom on their first album, Trop Banane!, appearing on the tracks \"Ghetto Hype\" and \"Bouger Bouger\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nL'Idéologie des stars (Saboteur Musique, 2006)\nSport de combat (2009)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Hit-pop\" (2007)\n\"Chewing-gum fraise\" (featuring Omnikrom) (2007)\n\"J'aime la bourgeoisie\" (2008)\n\"Tout est parfait\" (2009)\n\"Juste pour le flirt\" (featuring Teki Latex) (2010)"

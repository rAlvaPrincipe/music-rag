The band has been featured in publications such as Dazed & Confused and The Independent on Sunday, which described \"Tracks such as \"International Lover\", \"Kiss No.38\" (\"in the back of a limousine\", indeed) and \"Now We've Got Europe\" display an acute appreciation of continental romance and ageless glamour\".\nRiviera F's debut album Another City Another Plan was released in 2010 on their own record label Germ Free.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nAnother City Another Plan - Germ Free (2010)\n\"Hell On The Way\"\n\"Girls & Money\"\n\"Posing For The Cameras\"\n\"Pick Up star\"\n\"Dance To The Beat\"\n\"Echo Beach\"\n\"Dance Alone\"\n\"Lya Taboo\"\n\"Take You Down\"\n\"The Last Time\"\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nInternational Lover - Pop Cult/Tape Modern (2004)\n\"International Lover\"\n\"Information\"\n\"Nothing\"\n\"Girls and Money\"\n\"Another Crash and Burn\"\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nNow We've Got Europe - Kinetik Media (2004)\n\"Now We've Got Europe\"\n\"Information\"\n\"Now We've Got Europe (Blue Mix)\"\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nThis Is Hardcore - God Made Me Hardcore (2002)\n\"International Lover\"\nRobopop Volume I  - Lucky Pierre Recordings (2003)\n\"Information\"\nSnakebite City Eleven - Bluefire Records (2004)\n\"Lya Taboo\"\n\"Pick Up Star\"\nMiami Resistance Vol. 1 - Kinetik Media (2005)\n\"Girls & Money\"\nDream Boyz - DD Fan Club (2006)\n\"International Lover\"\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nFive Minute Love - Feria Music, Ojoparlante (2008)\n\"When The Rain Begins To Fall\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Web Site"

    "text": "The Ingenues were a vaudeville all-female jazz band.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nThe Ingenues  toured the United States and other countries from 1925 to 1937. William Morris started the group. Managed by Edward Gorman Sherman (1880–1940), the orchestra performed with great popularity around the world in variety theater, vaudeville and picture houses, often billed as \"The Girl Paul Whitemans of Syncopation.\"\n\nThey performed many songs in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1927, Glorifying the American Girl, including the first act finale, \"Melody Land,\" featuring 12 white baby grand pianos. Other Follies numbers featured violins, banjoes and saxophones from The Ingenues. The group performed popular songs, light classical works and novelties. They were celebrated for their versatility, as most members, including star soloist and \"trick trombonist\" Paula Jones, both novelty (accordions, harmonicas, banjos) and symphonic instruments.\nThe group toured Europe, South Africa, Asia, Australia and Brazil (where they also recorded for Columbia Records). The band appeared in film shorts including The Band Beautiful, Syncopating Sweeties\n\nand Maids and Music.\n\nMaids and Music was produced independently by Milton Schwarzwald's Nu-Atlas Productions and released as a 16mm home movie by Pictoreels.

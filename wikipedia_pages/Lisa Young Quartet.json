Their most recent work, The Eternal Pulse, is a wordless song-cycle featuring the intoned rhythmic recitation of konnakol, varieties of meter and subdivision, layering Indian elements, rhythmic textures and ensemble dialogue, in an evocative journey of sound and song. The quartet has released four albums, The Eternal Pulse, Grace, Speak and Transformation.\nYoung is also a founding member of an a cappella group, Coco's Lunch, which has recorded seven albums of original music. In 2003, Coco's Lunch won the award for 'Best Folk/World Song' at the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards, in the United States. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2007, Coco's Lunch received nominations in the category 'Best Children's Album' for Rat Trap Snap and in 'Best World Music Album' for Blueprint.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nTransformation (1991)\nSpeak (1999)\nGrace (2007)\nThe Eternal Pulse (2012)\nGrace Special Edition (2014)\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== Australian Women in Music Awards ===\nThe Australian Women in Music Awards is an annual event that celebrates outstanding women in the Australian Music Industry who have made significant and lasting contributions in their chosen field.

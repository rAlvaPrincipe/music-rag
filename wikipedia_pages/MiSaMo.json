    "text": "MiSaMo (Korean: 미사모; RR: Misamo; Japanese: ミサモ, Hepburn: Misamo; stylized in all caps) is the first sub-unit of the South Korean girl group Twice formed by JYP Entertainment. The group consists of Twice's Japanese members, Momo, Sana, and Mina. They debuted in 2023 with the extended play Masterpiece.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe subunit's name, MiSaMo, is a portmanteau of the names of members Mina, Sana, and Momo. Prior to the subunit's formation, the members often used the term \"MiSaMo\" to refer to themselves.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2012, Sana and Momo were originally planned to debut in a four-member girl group in Japan; however, JYP suspended the plan due to the deterioration of the Korean-Japanese relationship following the Liancourt Rocks dispute. In 2015, the members participated in Mnet's Sixteen, a competition survival show to decide Twice's lineup. \nIn February 2023, JYP announced that MiSaMo would debut with an extended play on July 26, with the track list including \"Bouquet\", originally released for TV Asahi's Liaison: Children's Heart Clinic. Ahead of Masterpiece's release, the song and music video for \"Marshmallow\" was released on June 15. The song and music video for the lead single, \"Do Not Touch\", was released on July 14. The group held their debut showcase, titled MiSaMo Japan Showcase \"Masterpiece\", over five days in Osaka and Yokohama, beginning on July 22. The five shows sold 40,000 tickets from more than 600,000 ticket applications.\nOn November 13, MiSaMo appeared in their first commercial as a group for the Google app, introducing its Google Lens feature. In December 2023, they participated in the 74th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen, where they performed \"Do Not Touch\". MiSaMo released their second EP Haute Couture on November 6, 2024, and embarked on a Japanese dome tour in support of the EP on November 2. The sub-lead track \"New Look\", a cover of Namie Amuro's \"New Look\" (2008), was released on October 9 with an accompanying music video. The lead single, \"Identity\", was released on October 28 along with a music video.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n=== Video albums ===\n\n\n== Concert tours ==\n\n\n=== MiSaMo Japan Showcase \"Masterpiece\" ===\n\n\n=== MiSaMo Japan Dome Tour 2024 \"Haute Couture\" ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Tegan and Sara () is a Canadian indie pop duo formed in 1998 in Calgary, Alberta. The band is led by identical twin sisters, Tegan Rain Quin and Sara Keirsten Quin (born September 19, 1980). Both musicians are songwriters and multi-instrumentalists.\nThe duo has released ten studio albums and earned a Grammy nomination in 2012 for their video album Get Along. Their most recent album, Crybaby, was released on October 21, 2022. Their memoir, High School, was released on September 24, 2019, and in the fall of 2022, the TV series based on the memoir was released on Amazon Freevee.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1995–2002: Background and early work ===\n\nTegan and Sara began writing songs at 14. One of the first songs they wrote was \"Tegan Didn't Go To School Today\", written by Sara and recorded by the pair on cassette tape. The band was first called \"Plunk\", short for \"light punk\", due to their lack of a drummer and bassist. In 1997, they used their school's recording studio to record two demo albums:  So Who's in Your Band? and Play Day. In 1998 they won Calgary's \"Garage Warz\" competition, which awarded them studio time. They recorded their first professional demo called Yellow Tape under \"Sara and Tegan\" using this studio time. This was followed by Orange Tape and Red Tape. In May 1998, they opened for Hayden in Calgary, marking their first major show.\nIn 1999, they released their debut album, Under Feet Like Ours, as \"Sara and Tegan\", with producer Jared Kuemper., After listening to it, Elliot Roberts flew up from Los Angeles to meet them at the Starfish Room in Vancouver, British Columbia, and he offered them a record deal that same night. Two songs from Red Tape and two from Orange Tape appeared on the album. They later changed their name to \"Tegan and Sara\" because people regularly misheard \"Sara and Tegan\" as \"Sara Antegan\". They signed with Neil Young's Vapor Records and released This Business of Art through the label in 2000. According to Tegan, having no manager for the first three years of their career taught them to be “very cognizant and present” in every decision.\n\n\n=== 2002–2011: Mainstream success ===\nIn 2002, Tegan and Sara released their third album, If It Was You. Their fourth album, So Jealous, was released in 2004 and led to wider success and attention, both locally and internationally. This album was released through both Vapor and Sanctuary. The band's 2007 album, The Con, was released by Vapor and Sire because Sanctuary no longer released new music in the United States. The album was co-produced by Chris Walla. Guests and collaborators on the album included Jason McGerr of Death Cab for Cutie, Matt Sharp of The Rentals (and previously Weezer), Hunter Burgan of AFI, and Kaki King.\nOn October 26, 2009, Tegan and Sara released their sixth album, Sainthood, produced by Chris Walla and Howard Redekopp.  Sainthood debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number 21, selling 24,000 copies in its first week. While recording the album, Tegan and Sara wrote songs together in New Orleans for a week. The song \"Paperback Head\" was the only song the pair wrote to appear on the album, making it the first song on any Tegan and Sara album they wrote together. Spin gave Sainthood four out of five stars and wrote, \"Tegan and Sara's music may no longer be the stuff of teens, but its strength remains in how much it feels like two people talking.\" The duo also put out a three-volume book set titled ON, IN, AT that included stories, essays, journals, and photos of the band touring America in late 2008, writing together in New Orleans and touring Australia. Lindsey Byrnes and Ryan Russell took the photographs in the book.\n\nIn 2011, they launched \"2011: A Merch Odyssey\", which saw at least one new item in the official online stores every month for the entire year. A live CD/DVD combination package titled Get Along was released on November 15 and contained three films titled \"States\", \"India\", and \"For the Most Part\". It was nominated for Best Long-Form Music Video at the 2013 Grammy Awards.\n\n\n=== 2012–2018: Heartthrob, Love You to Death, and The Con X: Covers ===\nTegan and Sara began recording their seventh studio album, Heartthrob, on February 20, 2012. Greg Kurstin produced eight songs. Joey Waronker contributed drums to these songs. Two songs were produced by Mike Elizondo, with Victor Indrizzo contributing drums, Josh Lopez contributing guitar, and Dave Palmer contributing piano. Justin Meldal-Johnsen had the last two songs. The first single, \"Closer\", was released on September 25, 2012. The album was released on January 29, 2013, and debuted on the Billboard Top 200 at number 3, the band's highest-charting record, selling 49,000 copies in its first week. Heartthrob debuted at number 2 on the Canadian chart and digital downloads chart and hit number 1 on the rock and alternative album charts. In July 2013, the album was shortlisted for the 2013 Polaris Music Prize. In March 2014, Tegan and Sara won three Juno Awards for Single of the Year, Pop Album of the Year and Group of the Year making them the first female band and the first duo to win this award.\nTegan and Sara finished their eighth studio album on November 30, 2015. On March 10, 2016, they announced that the album's title would be Love You to Death, with the release date set for June 3 of that year. They released the album's lead single, \"Boyfriend\", on April 8. On April 25, tour dates were announced for their 2016 global tour to support the album. The duo released a music video for each track on the album.\nTegan and Sara collaborated with 17 artists, including Cyndi Lauper, to create The Con X: Covers in 2017 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the release of The Con. The participating artists recorded covers of The Con's original songs to benefit the Tegan and Sara Foundation. Tegan and Sara also toured an acoustic version of The Con in 2017, with some of the proceeds supporting the Tegan and Sara Foundation.\n\n\n=== 2019–2020: Hey, I'm Just Like You and memoir ===\nIn May 2018, at Out Web Fest, Tegan stated they were working on a book, podcast and new record. On September 24, 2019, their memoir High School was released by MCD Books, a division of Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, alongside Simon & Schuster Canada and Virago Press in the United Kingdom. The memoir details their teenage years, growing up in Canada and \"worshipping\" Nirvana, Green Day and the Smashing Pumpkins. The book also details the twins' exploration of their sexuality. While researching the book, Tegan and Sara found cassettes of some of their earliest songs.\nIn early 2019, Tegan and Sara announced they were working on their next record for release later that year. On July 9, 2019, they announced via Instagram that their ninth album would be called Hey, I'm Just Like You and would consist of 12 re-recorded songs they initially wrote as teenagers. It was released on September 27, 2019, three days after the release of their memoir.\nIn April 2020, the duo created a live \"show\" called Where Does the Good Grow to entertain their fans during the COVID-19 pandemic, with merchandise designed by EE Storey. The show was held every Thursday at 3 p.m. PST on their Instagram account until the series finale on July 23, 2020.\nIn 2021, it was announced that a TV show named High School, based on their memoir of the same name, would be filmed in Calgary and directed by Clea DuVall. Twins Railey and Seazynn Gilliland were cast as the main characters. The show was filmed from April to June 2022 and was released on Amazon Freevee in the fall of 2022.\n\n\n=== 2021–2022: Still Jealous, new record label, and Crybaby ===\nIn July 2021, Tegan and Sara announced a return to the studio to work on their 10th album.

Still Jealous was released on February 11, 2022.\nIn April 2022, the duo announced they had left Warner Records and signed a new record deal with Mom + Pop. They also released the first single, \"Fucking Up What Matters\", from their 10th studio album on April 28, 2022.

The second single, \"Yellow\", was released on the same day, with the music video released on YouTube. The twins also announced their first tour in three years, which started in Philadelphia, PA, on October 26, 2022, and ended in Vancouver on November 20, 2022.\n\n\n=== 2023–Present: Junior High, Substack and Not Tonight Tour ===\nIn 2023 the duo released their first graphic novel, titled Junior High, based on their youth, with artwork by Tillie Walden. It explores the themes of growing up, coming out, and self-discovery through music and sisterhood (loosely serving as a prequel to their adolescence memoir, High School. In February 2024, the duo announced they would be introducing a new subscription to their already popular \"Substack\" called The Loners Club. This included the reintroduction of the pandemic-era Instagram show \"Where does the good grow\". In early 2024, the twins set out on tour to celebrate their album If It Was You (2002). The tour is centered around Ontario, Canada, starting in Richmond Hill in March 2024 and ending in Guelph in April 2024. In April 2024, the twins won the Juno Humanitarian award for their work with the Tegan and Sara Foundation.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nTegan and Sara have credited Green Day, Nirvana, and Hole for \"truly start[ing] to cement our desire to write and make our music\". During their teenage years, the duo was influenced by Hayden, The Smashing Pumpkins, Violent Femmes, Dinosaur Jr., and Teenage Fanclub.

In August 2022, Sara welcomed her first child, a son.\nAt 19, both Quins moved from their hometown of Calgary, Alberta, to Vancouver, B.C. In 2003, Sara moved to Montreal.

In the U.S., both were vocal during California's Prop 8 debates.\nIn 2013, the band partnered with Coolhaus, their \"favourite ice cream sandwich truck\", to create an ice cream sandwich in favour of same-sex marriage. The sandwich featured \"double chocolate\" cookies and salted caramel ice cream and was named \"Til Death Do Us Part\". The duo partnered with Revel & Riot to create a T-shirt that would fund Revel & Riot's mission for LGBTQ rights. The \"Animals\" T-shirt features Tegan and Sara, a turtle, fox, koala, penguin and a dragonfly, all labelled with their Latin names. The text at the bottom reads, \"Gay behaviour is found in over 1500 species. LGBTQ equality now.\" All sale proceeds go to benefit the work of Revel & Riot.\nDue to the expansion of their audience, Tegan and Sara have gained a higher profile in the LGBTQ community.

This inspired the band Matt and Kim to match their donation with merchandise proceeds.\nIn December 2016, in the wake of the United States presidential election, the sisters founded the Tegan and Sara Foundation to advocate for \"economic justice, health and representation for LGBTQ girls and women\". They have since partnered with Kiehl's to release Ultra Facial cleansers with limited-edition packaging to raise funds for the foundation. Profits from The Con X: Covers and a portion of ticket prices from The Con's 10th-anniversary tour went to the Tegan and Sara Foundation. At the end of The Con's 10th-anniversary tour in 2017, they stated their plan to take two years off from touring to focus on the foundation and to make a new record.\nIn 2024, Tegan and Sara began activism in response to new policy pitched by the United Conservative Party in Alberta. The proposed bill was posed to impact LGBTQ youth by outing them to parents if they used new pronouns or names in school, and limited medical care for trans youth. The Tegan and Sara Foundation published an open letter signed by more than 400 Canadian musicians denouncing the UCP policy. The two also used their Juno Awards speech time to speak against this policy.\n\n\n== Touring ==\n\nTegan and Sara began touring after graduating high school in 1998, travelling by car and Greyhound bus.

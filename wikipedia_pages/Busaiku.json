    "text": "Busaiku (舞祭組) is a Japanese boy band with four members from Kis-My-Ft2. They debuted on December 13, 2013 with the release of their first single A gift from heaven produced by Masahiro Nakai. They were dressed in plain suits like businessmen and sang many comical songs like comedians.\n\"Busaiku\" means \"ugly\" or \"uncool\" in Japanese, and was taken from the name of Kis-My-Ft2 namesake show \"Kis-My Busaiku,\" which was unusual for a group name from the idol agency, Johnny & Associates.\nTheir single Signpost was number-one on the weekly Oricon Singles Chart.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nOn the October 5, 2013 broadcast of \"Kiss My Busaiku! (Fuji Television), Masahiro Nakai who was a member of SMAP, mentioned that the \"back four\" four members of Kis-My-Ft2, Wataru Yokoo, Toshiya Miyata, Takashi Nikaido, and Kento Senga, were not getting much attention compared to the front members, Hiromitsu Kitayama, Taisuke Fujigaya, and Yuta Tamamori. He also offered to provide the music. Masahiro Nakai was senior of Kis-My-Ft2 at the same agent Johnny & Associates, the leader of the national boy band SMAP, and a successful entertainer who has many regular programs and often hosts them. On the November 11, 2013 broadcast of \"Kis-My Busaiku!\" (Fuji Television), the four members of the new unit \"Busaiku\" announced that their debut single A gift from heaven would be released on December 13. The \"Sound Room\" (TBS Television (Japan)) broadcast on the same day, hosted by Nakai, was their first TV program appearance as Busaiku.

On November 15 of the same year, they performed \"A gift from heaven\" live for the first time at Kis-My-Ft2's Tokyo Dome concert.\n\n\n== Group of \"back four\" ==\nAfter their debut, Kis-My-Ft2 aggressively promoted the so-called \"front three,\" Yuta Tamamori, Taisuke Fujigaya, and Hiromitsu Kitayama. The three starred in dramas and danced in flashy costumes in singing shows. On the other hand, Kento Senga, Toshiya Miyata, Wataru Yokoo, and Takashi Nikaido called \"back four\" wore dark costumes like back dancers behind the three, had few singing assignments, and did little individual work.\nAt the time, frequent collaborators were their seniors group SMAP, and member Masahiro Nakai noticed this situation of these four and decided to produce them himself. The concept of the debut song \"A Gift from Heaven,\" for which Nakai wrote the lyrics, was \"the cry from the heart of 'back 4'\" and \"the coolness of doing your best even if you are unattractive,\" and the music video also featured a self-deprecating contrast between the \"cool and popular three\" and the \"uncool and unpopular us.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nWataru Yokoo\nToshiya Miyata\nTakashi Nikaido\nKento Senga\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2013 ===\nOn Friday, December 13, Busaiku started with their first single A gift from heaven.\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\nOn April 21, they made a regular appearance on the music program \"UTAGE!\"\nOn July 27, they released their second single Tee-tee-tee-terete teretee (Whose ass).\nOn October 18, the drama \"Heisei Busaiku Otoko\", in which all members appear, begins airing.\n\n\n=== 2015 ===\nOn March 8, their third single, I goofed!! was released.\n\n\n=== 2017 ===\nOn January 4, their 4th single Signpost was released.

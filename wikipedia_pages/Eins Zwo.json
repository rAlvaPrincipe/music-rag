    "text": "Eins Zwo (\"One Two\") was a German hip hop group from Hamburg, consisting of DJ Rabauke (Thomas Jensen) and MC Dendemann (Daniel Ebel). Rabauke produced his first music with his 'Projekt an der Grenze'. He however, was before Eins Zwo more known for his work as tour DJ with the group Fettes Brot. Dendemann was formerly mostly associated with his work as a member of the 'Vorgruppe Arme Ritter'.\nEins Zwo started out in 1997. Running into each other during a soundcheck that year they decided to make music together and create the demo \"S.P.O.R.T\". Later that year they accompanied the group 5 Sterne Deluxe as support act on a short tour through Germany and enlarged on their \"S.P.O.R.T.\" demotape. The tape was then released nationwide as an EP halfway through 1998 in its unaltered, unmastered form and quickly became highly sought after in the scene. It was reputedly the most illegally copied album in the German hip hop scene that year.\nIn May 1999, their first longplay album was released: Gefährliches Halbwissen. The word-wizardry of Dendemann became through this album the trademark of the band. While their second album, aptly named Zwei (\"Two\"), released in 2001, held the same high textual, musical and technical standard, it did not have the same impact as their debut album. With the upcoming EP \"Discjockeys\" the group announced their farewell.\nSince 2003 both group members have gone their own way. Dendemann released the EP \"DasSchweigenDilemma\" in the autumn of that same year and in September 2006 the LP Die Pfütze des Eisbergs. DJ Rabauke has mostly been working as a DJ in the house scene and has, among other things, played at the Melt! festival.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1999 - Gefährliches Halbwissen (Yo Mama)\n2001 - Zwei (Yo Mama)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1998 - \"Sport\"\n1999 - \"Danke, gut\" (Yo Mama)\n1999 - \"Hand aufs Herz\" (Yo Mama)\n1999 - \"Tschuldigung/Weltretten 4-\" (Yo Mama)\n2001 - \"Bombe/Undsoweiter\" (Yo Mama)\n2003 - \"Discjockeys\" - (EP, Yo Mama)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

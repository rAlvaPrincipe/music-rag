    "text": "My Cat Is An Alien (MCIAA) is an Italian musical duo and outsider audiovisual artist consisting of brothers Maurizio and Roberto Opalio, formed in Torino, Italy, in late 1997. The band releases avant garde / experimental music in a form of improvisation that MCIAA themselves define 'instantaneous composition'.Italy's MY CAT IS AN ALIEN is the finest two-brother band from Italy since the end of the Great War.\nIn September 2011, My Cat Is An Alien was the cover feature in The Wire magazine.\n\n\n== Releases ==\nTony Herrington, editor-in-chief & publisher of The Wire, characterizes the duo as\n\nRoberto and his brother Maurizio are the highly advanced lifeforms crewing the mysterious starship that goes by the name of My Cat Is An Alien (MCIAA), plotting a quixotic course through three millennia of cosmic music, from the celestial drones of the Pythagorean monochord onwards, to land up in the gravity-free realm of the No-mind\nThe group has a large number of albums and side project material which is widely available on CDs, LPs and digital downloads released by the labels Atavistic (USA), Important (USA), Very Friendly/ Cargo (UK), P.S.F. (Japan), and Elliptical Noise (CAN) among many others.\nAll MCIAA's album covers come from paintings, drawings and photographs by Roberto Opalio. Since artwork is a basic aspect of every record, MCIAA often release limited art edition vinyls, lathe cuts, cassettes, CD-Rs and DVD-Rs on their own Opax Records imprint, and other independent record labels.\nIn their early years, MCIAA made all recordings in the 'Space Room', the duo's first studio, located in an abandoned factory zone to the north of Torino city centre. As expression of their DIY aesthetics they self-released many limited CD-Rs during that period.\nMCIAA's international debut album Landscapes Of An Electric City/ Hypnotic Spaces 3-sided LP on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace! label in 2002 earned high marks from Dusted Magazine (volcanic, both in sound quality and seeping magnitude…floating, impressionistic noise.\") and Bananafish Magazine, and a special mention on the book Post Rock (Giunti).\nFrom 2004 MCIAA put out three consecutive vinyl releases on Eclipse Records—The Rest Is Silence (2004), When The Windmill's Whirl Dies (2005), and Greetings From The Great Void (2006)— later intended as a trilogy.\nAnother concept album collecting some of their most remarkable ambient, instrumental works, The Cosmological Eye Trilogy, was published as a 3 CD set on Last Visible Dog Records and awarded as \"BEST 2005 ANTHOLOGY\" by Foxy Digitalis, hereby introduced by editor-in-chief Brad Rose:\n\nAs 2005 went on, I became a bigger and bigger My Cat Is An Alien fan. This Italian brother-duo are cosmic travellers, giving us earthlings a taste of stellar dust. This 3 CD set is absolutely essential. A pile of music to reach the summit of Olympus Mons, missing this would be an absolute crime.\nAfter other key works such as Il Segno (Starlight Furniture Co., 2003), and Through The Reflex Of The Rain (Free Porcupine Society, 2005), in 2005 Important Records started releasing some albums that were met with praise by critics and contemporaries alike—Cosmic Light Of The Third Millennium (2005), Leave Me In The Black No-Thing (2007), For The Tears Of The Land_Prayers From The Outer Space (2009), Roberto Opalio's soloist debut Chants From Isolated Ghosts (2007), and an untitled limited split vinyl LP of solo works by the two brothers (2009)—\n\nThis is highly original music.You can get lost inside its minimal, limpid beauty.\nclaimed Ed Pinsent, editor & publisher of The Sound Projector Magazine.\nDifferent Shades Of Blue, published by defunct label A Silent Place in 2006, has been awarded album of 2005 in the Top 30 chart \"THE BEST OF AMBIENT WORKS 1978-2008\" by the prestigious Studio Voice multi-media magazine and book publications in Japan.\nIn 2005 the Opalio brothers moved their recording studio from Torino to a remote and secret location in the Western Alps they call 'Alien Zone', where Roberto introduced his wordless vocalizations as a leading instrument. In this regard English writer Ken Hollings, author of MCIAA cover article in The Wire, states:\n\nLess a celestially pure tone than a cosmic moan, his brother's [Roberto] vocals find a distant echo in Blind Willie Johnson's Dark Was The Night Cold Was The Ground, recorded on Earth back in 1927 but currently making its way through deep space aboard Voyager as part of its collection of human music.\nFrom the vastness of the Alpine territory, the brothers released new key works, including Black Shadows From Jupiter, Vol.I & II (Opax Records, 2005 / Elliptical Noise, 2009), Photoelectric Season (Elliptical Noise, 2010), and Fragments Suspended In Time (Opax Records, 2010).\nStarting from 2009, most of their new albums are published by their devoted Canadian label Elliptical Noise Records, that in 2011 put out the triple CD set What Space Is Made For, whose track The Antigravitational Sense Of Nothingness is featured in Wire Tapper 25 CD Compilation accompanying The Wire magazine No. 326 (April 2011).\nIn 2008 My Cat Is An Alien also signed for Atavistic Worldwide.\nOn September 14, 2011 My Cat Is An Alien's first thirteen years of activity were celebrated with ALIENOLOGY: Selected Works 1998-2008, a ten disc box retrospective published by Elliptical Noise.\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\nMy Cat Is An Alien have multimedia collaborations with acts such as Sonic Youth, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, Christian Marclay, Keiji Haino, Jim O'Rourke, Loren Mazzacane Connors, Jackie-O Motherfucker, Nels Cline (Wilco), Text of Light, Steve Roden, Christina Carter (Charalambides), Mats Gustafsson, Enore Zaffiri and many more.\nIn July 2004 MCIAA started a project of collaboration with some of these artists in the form of two series of special split Art-LP releases (later re-issued on CD) entitled From the earth to the Spheres (7 volumes) and Cosmic Debris (5 volumes), which have been acclaimed as some of the most original publications in the record history, every vinyl copy coming along a proper 30x30 cm acrylic painting on canvas or wood panels, in the latter series with the addition of installed Polaroid films. Roberto Opalio realized every volume in 100 unique exemplars, individually signed and numbered. The From the earth to the Spheres series has been awarded 2004's “Avant Rock Top 10\" by The Wire.\n\nItalian DIY space rockers My Cat Is An Alien’s rampant release schedule continues to attract Sun Ra worshippers to their cause. The production takes on the mantle of a release from Saturn. wrote Edwin Pouncey (The Wire), The creative concept behind the Opalio brothers' ongoing From the earth to the Spheres series of dual recordings featuring guest artists is somewhat reminiscent of the ESP-Disk mantra.\nAt the beginning of 2008 My Cat Is An Alien were introduced to Italian pioneer of electronic music Enore Zaffiri (at the time 80 years old). In February, the trio recorded some completely improvised material, with Zaffiri re-working some of his reel-to-reel tapes from the 1960s. Despite their opposite methods in composing music, a strong musical connection is documented by this session released by Atavistic in the CD+DVD set entitled Through The Magnifying Glass Of Tomorrow (2009), also featuring two art films: Trasparenze (by Zaffiri) and Light_Earth_Blue_Silver (by Roberto Opalio, with soundtrack by MCIAA).\nIn 2008, Roberto Opalio and My Cat Is An Alien were invited by Sonic Youth to take part in  Sonic Youth etc.: Sensational Fix exhibition. At the opening at LiFE museum in St-Nazaire, France, MCIAA joined Lee Ranaldo (Sonic Youth) for a special live music performance collaboration, along with Michael Morley (Dead C), and Opalio's close collaborator Ramona Ponzini (Painting Petals On Planet Ghost), later released by Starlight Furniture Co. in a limited vinyl edition—Live @ Sensational Fix, 2009. Later that year, a further collaborative live event with Lee Ranaldo occurred in Verona, Italy, this time close to the second opening of the same exhibition at Museion in Bolzano. In 2010 Atavistic released it on CD with the title All Is Lost In Translation.\n\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nMulti-instrumentalists, My Cat Is An Alien primarily play electric and acoustic guitars, various toy instruments (so-called 'space toys'), modified electronics ('alientronics') and a wide set of percussion. Roberto Opalio's use of wordless vocalizations are also present on many tracks.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nMy Cat Is An Alien's shamanic-like live performances are rare; during the years they showed up only at selected special events, and some of the most prestigious international festivals of avant garde and experimental music: K-RAA-K (Belgium), Ferrara Sotto Le Stelle (Italy), the Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville (Canada), whose recording has been released through Les Disques VICTO (Il Suono Venuto dallo Spazio, 2006), and ATP Nightmare Before Christmas curated by Thurston Moore (UK), were MCIAA were introduced this way:\n\nMy Cat Is An Alien's music is always free at its root level, always exploring some nook of the cosmos... The brothers have always maintained that what they produce is a kind of psychedelia, and surely that's true. But it is a form of the music so far from the rote harmonics of the paisleys, that it's not recognizable as anything, except perhaps pure hallucination. Then, what could possibly closer to the true nature of psychedelia? The music MCIAA create sounds different, looks different, smells different, depending on where you are in the room. It's a total dislocation of inputs and outputs and everything else. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. - Byron Coley\n\n\n== Audiovisual art ==\nBefore starting their musical career, Maurizio and especially Roberto Opalio had interests in visual arts, operating in almost all disciplines, painting, photography, drawing, poetry, sculpture, audiovisual installation, film and videos were practiced by Opalio. All of the artworks of My Cat Is An Alien's records represent paintings, photos and drawings by Roberto Opalio, and are curated personally by the duo, thus giving a totally peculiar visual aspect to their musical releases.\nIn 2005 Roberto Opalio has been commissioned to design an exclusive T-shirt for The Wire magazine.\nIn 2008, Roberto Opalio and My Cat Is An Alien were invited by Sonic Youth to take part to Sonic Youth etc.: Sensational Fix exhibition, scheduled in big European museums of contemporary arts between 2008 and 2010. Other than the official exhibition catalog published by Walter Koenig, curator Roland Groenenboom presented a spin-off limited zine at Malmo Konsthall, featuring exclusive artworks by Roberto Opalio and MCIAA, alongside Christian Marclay, Savage Pencil, Barbara Ess, Marco Fusinato.\nRoberto Opalio contributed to this exhibition with Alien Guitar Case No. 6, one in his series of installations made of the artist's multimedia artworks and objects incorporated into MCIAA's used guitar cases; and his film entitled Alien Blood (2005–2008), whose soundtrack by MCIAA was issued in a very limited vinyl art edition on Opax Records, and later included in ALIENOLOGY: Selected Works 1998-2008 (2011).\n\nIn 2009 Atavistic published on DVD Roberto Opalio's dual film Light_Earth_Blue_Silver (2008), that the artist himself claims as \"proudly filmed in 8mm\" up on a desolate track in Western Alps. The soundtrack is by My Cat Is An Alien. The film was presented at Netwerk Center for Contemporary Art in Aalst (Belgium) in March 2009, at Octubre CCC (Centre de Cultura Contemporània) in Valencia (Spain) in April 2009, at Netmage.10 International Live-Media Festival at Palazzo Re Enzo, Bologna (Italy) in January 2010. Ken Hollings writes about it in his cover article (The Wire, No. 331): Light_Earth_Blue_Silver communicates this sense of immediacy with great concentration and power. Its sole protagonist is a large wire model of the Alien icon Roberto has been featuring in paintings and drawings over many years. A stick figure with widely extended arms and legs, its head is a single sharply elliptical eye, permanently open and staring out at the universe that surrounds it. In a series of raw ritual gestures, the Alien is dragged and pushed through a rough winter landscape: shown across two screens, the twitching of the wire limbs makes it appear as if the Alien were writhing and crawling over the snow-covered rocks and brown, bare earth. To MCIAA's intense soundtrack, the Alien becomes entangled with branches, twigs and lichen until at the movie's climax, he is seen moving upright against a blue Alpine sky.\nThe same article shows pictures and works taken in the Opalio brothers' studio for visual arts, named 'Alien Studio'.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nALBUMS\n\ns/t CD-r (Opax Records, 1998)\nLandscapes Of An Electric City CD-r (Opax Records/ ZZZ Prod.,1999)\nThe Alien cd-r Attack Series!

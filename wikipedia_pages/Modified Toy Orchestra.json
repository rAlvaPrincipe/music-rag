    "text": "The Modified Toy Orchestra is an experimental music group from Birmingham, England. Brian Duffy, the main member and creator of the orchestra makes the group's instruments by circuit bending sound making devices, such as toy keyboards, and educational spelling toys.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was founded by Brian Duffy as a one-man project. He originally began by sampling sounds from toys to use in his electronic music, but after disassembling a Texas Instruments Speak & Spell he realised he could modify them to produce new sounds, turning the toys themselves into instruments. He began looking in car boot sales and skips for more electronic toys to modify and use in performances.\nDuffy describes the intent behind his music as “an interest in the surplus value and hidden potential of seemingly redundant technology.”\n\n\n== Members ==\nBrian Duffy\nDarren Joyce\nLaurence Hunt\nSean Tighe\nChris Plant\nGraeme Rose\n\n\n== Past members ==\nMike Johnston  – his last performance with Modified Toy Orchestra was on 15 October 2007 at the Birmingham Town Hall. He sang a cover version of Kraftwerk's Pocket Calculator as his last song with the band.\n\n\n== Live ==\nIn 2006, the Modified Toy Orchestra was expanded from a one-man project by Brian Duffy to a full six-piece band, to have more possibilities when playing live.\nNew live members are: Laurence Hunt (Pram), Darren Joyce (Dreams of Tall Buildings), Mike Johnston (Plone, Mike in Mono), and visual projection artist Chris Plant (Colour Burst). Together they have performed at the 2006 Sónar festival in Barcelona and Supersonic festival in the United Kingdom. Previous performances have included the Royal Institute, and supporting bands Heaven 17 and Melt Banana. Live sets have also been transmitted on Resonance FM and BBC Radio 1.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSilfurberg (CD album, Bit-Phalanx Music, 2023)\nPlastic Planet (LP, Warm Circuit Records, 2010)\nPocket Calculator / TVOD (Limited Edition 7\" vinyl, Warm Circuit Records, 2006)\nToygopop (LP, Warm Circuit Records, 2006)\nThis is the Monkey (7\" vinyl, Warm Circuit Records, 2004)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBio from Warm Circuit Records\nMySpace Profile\nOfficial band website"

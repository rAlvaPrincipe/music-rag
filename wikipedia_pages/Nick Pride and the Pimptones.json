    "text": "Nick Pride and the Pimptones are a funk/jazz/soul band based in Newcastle upon Tyne. The Pimptones were formed in 2007 by guitarist, composer, and arranger Nick Pride. Their record label Record Kicks describes them as \"a deep funk/jazz-dance outfit playing original music in the style of The Meters, JTQ, and Charlie Hunter. \"\n\n\n== It's the Pimptones ==\nIn the original line-up, Pride was joined by Oscar Cassidy (drums), Ian 'dodge' Paterson (bass), Dave Wilde (sax and flute), and Alex Leathard (trombone). This first incarnation of the band can be heard on the debut release, It’s the Pimptones (Jazz Girl Records).\nIn 2009, the band released the 7\" single \"Deeper Pimp\" on Wack Records, which received radioplay across Europe, including on the Craig Charles Funk and Soul Show on BBC 6, and became the first of the group’s trademark \"Live-Band Bootlegs,\" a unique approach to the Mash-Up genre and a show-stopping live feature. The success of the single brought live performance opportunities the North-East of England, supporting bands including Maceo Parker, Candi Staton, Youngblood Brass Band and Hot 8 Brass Band.\n\n\n== Midnight Feast of Jazz ==\nA new horn section line-up (Keith Nicholson and Tomas Quilliam) yielded a tougher, funkier sound. The 2011 single \"Waitin' So Long\" featured Jess Roberts, and the album Midnight Feast of Jazz featured Roberts, as well as Susan Hamilton and Zoe Gilby. Reviews of this album callied it \"a very strong debut by Nick Pride here that you can dance to or just sit back and groove to\", \"a refreshing blast of energy and musical enthusiasm\", and \"There’s so much below-average funk being made at the moment, and so let this be a sharp lesson to all of those bands. This is how it should be done. More please!\". One reviewer commented that \"these guys are certainly capable of throwing a party in your living room as well as in the town hall of your city\".\n\n\n== Re-juiced Phat Shake ==\nThe Pimptones third studio album, Re-juiced Phat Shake, was released on Legere Recordings on February 14, 2014 and featured even more guest singers. Nick Pride states \"I was always a fan of amazing pop songwriters like Burt Bacharach and Holland-Dozier-Holland, but on the other hand, being a dedicated musician, I love the raw energy of being on stage with a funk band\". Reviews said \"The emphasis is on songwriting backed with energetic, tight funky playing\"; \"an album filled with soulfully deep and satisfying recordings that are light on filler, yet heavy on grooves to keep your body shaking to the beat\";\"one of the most exciting albums of 2014\".\nAt that time, John Waugh replaced Tomas Quilliam sax player.  \n\n\n== Go Deep ==\nWith the sudden departure of John Waugh (sax) to join The 1975 both Alex Saxon (sax) and Beth Macari (vocals) were brought in to re-focus the band on an older school funk & soul sound. The result of this is the new album Go Deep recorded live in Newcastle upon Tyne in August 2015 at Loft Studios, and being released on Légère Recordings in June 2016.\n\n\n== Live performances / airplay ==\nThe group has played in many UK venues known for hosting funk bands, including the 100 Club, The Yardbird in Birmingham, Band on The Wall in Manchester, Hi-Fi Club in Leeds, the Jazzbar in Edinburgh, as well as festivals such as The Mostly Jazz Festival, The North East Funk and Soul Revue, and The Sage Gateshead International Jazz Festival.\nInternationally they have played at the Imagina Funk Festival (2015), Novara Jazz Festival (2012) and Swingin' Groningen (2012) along with various gigs in Italy and Spain.\nIn 2011, The Pimptones remix of The Breakbeat Junkie track \"Rock The Funky Beat\" become a firm favourite of the BBC6 Music Funk and Soul Show, and was one of the most requested songs on RAI Radio 2’s Pop Corner (Italy).\nNick Pride also hosts a Pimptones podcast centered on the band as well as other artists in the North East England area.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nThe current line-up for Nick Pride and the Pimptones is as follows:\n\nNick Pride - guitar, vocals, songwriter\nPete Lawson - drums\nJimmy Brown - electric bass\nKeith Nicholson - trumpet / flugel\nAlex Saxon - saxophone / flute\nEliza Lawson - vocals\nThe Pimptones have collaborated with:\n\nOscar Cassidy - drums, percussion\nIan Paterson - bass guitar\nChris Hibbard - trombone\nDave Wilde - saxophone, flute\nAlex Leathard - trombone\nGraham Hardy - trumpet, flugel horn\nJohn Wheeler - saxophone\nJames Peacock - keyboard\nPaul Edis - piano\nPaul Loraine - keyboard\nLaurie Shepherd - guest vocals\nZoe Gilby - guest vocals\nJess Roberts - guest vocals\nSusan Hamilton - guest vocals\nAdam Sinclair - drums\nTom Quilliam - saxophone\nJohn Waugh - saxophone\nLyndon Anderson - guest vocals / harmonica\nRenegade Brass Band\nKaren Harding - guest vocals\nDubbul O - guest vocals\nCourtney Valencia - guest vocals\nThomas Lane Hewitt - guest vocals\nBeth Macari - lead vocals\nSue Ferris - tenor sax, baritone sax\nMicky Moran Parker - guest vocals\nRenegade Brass Band - brass, vocals, percussion\n\n\n=== Discography ===\nAlbums\nIt's The Pimptones!!!!!!!

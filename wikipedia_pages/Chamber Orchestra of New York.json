    "text": "Chamber Orchestra of New York is a professional orchestra founded as Chamber Orchestra of New York - Ottorino Respighi by the Italian composer and conductor Salvatore Di Vittorio. It was established on March 27, 2006, on the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with its debut concert on October 11, 2007 at Carnegie Hall's Zankel Hall as part of the inaugural 2007/2008 Season.\n\n\n== About the Orchestra ==\nThe Orchestra was modeled after other younger European-style orchestras, and is recognized as one of the first orchestras in the United States to follow this tradition. Its roster is cultivated through live auditions and the ensemble recruits from leading New York and east coast music conservatories such as the Juilliard School, Manhattan School of Music and Mannes College of Music, as well as Yale School of Music and Eastman School of Music among others. The orchestra performs its annual concert series at Carnegie Hall (in Weill and Zankel halls), receives continued international acclaim for it ongoingNaxos Records albums, and has partnered for prominent productions with The Morgan Library & Museum, United Nations, Dolce & Gabbana at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Tory Burch, and Disney for Star Wars.\n\n\n== Mission ==\n\"Chamber Orchestra of New York is a premier ensemble that features a seasoned roster of our city’s most flourishing musicians. The orchestra is internationally distinguished for championing unique repertoire that bridges the classical and modern traditions, including iconic film music, through premieres and world premiere recordings of rediscovered masterworks. Through all-embracing approaches with its distinct programs – from performances to educational outreach – the orchestra aims to cultivate a broader audience across generations for the future of classical music.\"\n\n\n== The Orchestra and Ottorino Respighi ==\nIn 2008, Ottorino Respighi’s great nieces Elsa and Gloria Pizzoli, and archive curator/cataloger Potito Pedarra, entrusted Music Director and Composer Salvatore Di Vittorio with the task of editing, orchestrating, and completing several of Respighi’s early orchestral works – such as the first Violin Concerto (in A) – in their first printed, published editions (now) distributed by Casa Ricordi in Milan. The orchestra continues to premiere ongoing new editions by Di Vittorio of Respighi's music in premieres as well as recordings on Naxos Records.\n\n\n== The Respighi Prize Music Competition ==\nThe orchestra established The Respighi Prize / Il Premio Respighi Music Competition, for young composers, conductors and soloists, in 2010 in collaboration with Comune di Bologna, Italy - Respighi's birthplace.\n\n\n== New York Conducting Workshop & Competition ==\nThe orchestra maintains a conducting workshop each Spring which offers conductors of all ages and countries the opportunity to reflect, discuss, and refine their podium experiences with veteran mentor conductors. All participants automatically become candidates of The Respighi Prize, and the winner and finalists are offered an opportunity to share the podium in selected concerts.\n\n\n== Advisory board ==\nThe orchestra’s Advisory Board developed to include esteemed artists such as film composer Ennio Morricone, conductor Alan Gilbert, and soloists Lynn Harrell, Cho-Liang Lin and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg.

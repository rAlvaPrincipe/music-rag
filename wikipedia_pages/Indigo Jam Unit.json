    "text": "Indigo Jam Unit (stylised as indigo jam unit) was a Japanese jazz band formed in Osaka, Japan in 2005.\n\n\n== Members ==\nYoshichika Tarue (樽栄嘉哉), born July 9, 1974 - piano\nKatsuhiko Sasai (笹井克彦), born December 6, 1976 - double bass\nIsao Wasano (和佐野功), born September 25, 1979 - percussion, drums\nTakehiro Shimizu (清水勇博), born March 27, 1983 - drums\n\n\n== History ==\nIndigo Jam Unit, a quartet, originated out of a trio consisting of Yoshichika Tarue (piano), Katsuhiko Sasai (double bass), and Isao Wasano (percussion and drums). In 2005, the trio had been playing live and working with different member setups when they started working with independent record label producer Kenichi Tateiwa of Basis Records, who suggested they add Takehiro Shimizu on drums to the line up. Shimizu joined the band in the months leading up to the recording of their first album, DEMONSTRATION, in August 2005. Shimizu currently (November, 2011) divides his time between Osaka, Japan, and New York City.\nIndigo Jam Unit is often grouped together with other bands from the Japanese jazz and nu jazz scene, such as Quasimode, Soil & \"Pimp\" Sessions, and Sleepwalker among others. Indigo Jam Unit have distinguished themselves with a twin drum line up where Shimizu contributes the jazzier rhythms and drum solos while Wasano adds a heavier straight beat and percussion.\nIndigo Jam Unit always record their material live in the studio with little post processing and as few effects as possible. No edits or overdubs are made to their recordings. The only exception is their 2009 release re:common on Rambling Records, featuring American hip-hop artist Common and hip-hop/soul artist  Mary J. Blige's original voice tracks with indigo jam unit's instrumental tracks added separately.\nIndigo Jam Unit have recorded and performed together with  Japanese jazz vocalist Karen Aoki (SUMMERTIME feat. Indigo Jam Unit, 2008), label mates Flexlife (Vintage Black, 2009), and Trinidadian vocalist Alicia Saldenha (ROSE, 2011).\nIn September–October 2009 Indigo Jam Unit were featured in Tower Record's No Music, No Life poster series in Japan. The poster was shared with DJ Tatsuo Sunaga.\nOn November 1, 2015, indigo jam unit announced that they will disband in summer of 2016.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums (original material) ===\n2006: DEMONSTRATION\n2006: 2x2\n2007: REALism\n2008: Pirates\n2009: Collectivity\n2010: Roots\n2011: INDEPENDENT\n2012: REBEL\n2013: Milestone\n2014: indigo jam unit\n2015: Lights\n\n\n=== Studio albums (remastered material) ===\n2011: DEMONSTRATION - Remaster - Re-issue with two additional tracks on SHM-CD.\n2014: REALism - Remaster - Re-issue in the Japanese SHM-CD format.\n2015: 2x2 - Remaster - Re-issue in the Japanese SHM-CD format.\n\n\n=== Studio albums (cover songs/remixes) ===\n2009: Vintage Black - Cover album with Flexlife\n2009: re:common - Cover/re-mix album\n2011: ROSE - Cover album featuring Alicia Saldenha\n2013: impression - Cover album.

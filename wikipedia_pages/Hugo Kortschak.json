His son was the plant physiologist Hugo P. Kortschak.\nThe Berkshire String Quartet was founded when music patroness Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge persuaded Kortschak to move his quartet from Chicago to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where its members could focus exclusively on chamber music. In his youth Kortschak was a member of the Pozniak-Trio founded by the Polish pianist Bronislaw Pozniak.\nKortschak was an owner of several fine violins, including:\n\nIn 1914: a Joseph Guarnerius violin, once the property of the Crown Treasurer of Spain; and\nPeriod of ownership unknown:  Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesù, 1739c\nFrom 1925 to 1957: a 1698 Stradivarius violin, once owned by Joseph Joachim and later Joan Field\nKortschak was an influential teacher in Chicago, Illinois. Ruth Scott Miller, the first female music critic of the Chicago Tribune, studied violin with Kortschak between 1912 and 1915, first in Chicago and then Berlin. She credited Kortschak and conductor Frederick Stock for inspiring her to become a concert violinist.\nKortschak was a key figure in organizing the Berkshire Chamber Music Festival founded by Coolidge. The original Berkshire String Quartet disbanded sometime after 1941.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nKortschak is a recipient of the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Medal for \"eminent services to chamber music.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="

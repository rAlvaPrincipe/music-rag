The ensemble which has released numerous recordings on the Thrill Jockey and Delmark labels.\n\n\n== Rob Mazurek / Chad Taylor ==\nRob Mazurek was born in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1965, and played trumpet and cornet in high school. After high school he attended the Bloom School of Jazz in Chicago, and began playing gigs with local jazz musicians.\nIn 1996, Mazurek founded a workshop at Chicago jazz club The Green Mill called Chicago Underground for the performance of avant-garde, improvisatory jazz. By 1998, a new ensemble had formed around this idea, featuring guitarist Jeff Parker, drummer Chad Taylor, bassist Noel Kupersmith, and trombonist Sara Smith. After this ensemble released an album on Chicago's Delmark Records as the Chicago Underground Orchestra, Mazurek and Taylor continued to form groups under the Chicago Underground umbrella, performing as the Chicago Underground Duo, Chicago Underground Trio and Chicago Underground Quartet.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== As Chicago Underground Duo ===\n12° of Freedom (Thrill Jockey, 1998)\nSynesthesia (Thrill Jockey, 2000)\nAxis and Alignment (Thrill Jockey, 2002)\nIn Praise of Shadows (Thrill Jockey, 2006)\nBoca Negra (Thrill Jockey, 2010)\nAge of Energy (Northern-Spy, 2012)\nLocus (Northern-Spy, 2014)\n\n\n=== As Chicago Underground Trio ===\nPossible Cube (Delmark, 1999)\nFlamethrower (Delmark, 2000)\nSlon (Thrill Jockey, 2003)\nChronicle (Delmark, 2007)\n\n\n=== As Chicago Underground Quartet ===\nChicago Underground Quartet (Thrill Jockey, 2001)\nGood Days (Astral Spirits Records, 2020)\n\n\n=== As Chicago Underground Orchestra ===\nPlayground (Delmark 1998)\n\n\n=== As Pharoah & The Underground ===\nSpiral Mercury (Clean Feed Records, 2014) - with Pharoah Sanders and São Paulo Underground\nPrimative Jupiter (Clean Feed Records, 2014) - with Pharoah Sanders and São Paulo Underground\n\n\n=== As Chicago London Underground ===\nA Night Walking Through Mirrors (Cuneiform Records, 2017) - with Alexander Hawkins and John Edwards\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInterview on All About Jazz website"

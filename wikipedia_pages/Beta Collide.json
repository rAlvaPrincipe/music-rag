Debut Album ==\n\"Psst...psst!\" comes from the opening track, a chamber arrangement of György Ligeti's \"Mysteries of the Macabre\"  a giddily anarchic play of instrumental outbursts and spoken word. \"Memories of an Echo,\" evocative of the ancient Japanese court music tradition, gagaku; and dreamy washes of distorted sound in Stephen Vitiello's \"Yellow.\"  \nThe record features absurdly virtuosic music by Ligeti and Erickson, it features also  soundscapes by Kyr and Vitiello, a Rzewski trifecta. It also includes music by Frederic Rzewski (his \"Mollitude,\" composed for Barth), Valentin Silvestrov and Radiohead. Thom Yorke and Colin Greenwood contribute to a remix of that band's \"Nude.\"\n\n\n== Track List ==\nTitle\tComposer(s)\tPerformer(s)\tLength\nMysteries of the Macabre\tGyörgy Ligeti Beta Collide 6:40\nMollitude\tFrederic Rzewski Beta Collide 2:59\nTrio\tValentin Silvestrov Beta Collide 9:18\nMemories of an Echo\tRobert Kyr Beta Collide 9:08\nNanosonata No.7 + Mollitude\tFrederic Rzewski Beta Collide 2:56\nWaterline\tStephen Vitiello Beta Collide 6:16\nKryl\tRobert Erickson Beta Collide 6:11\nNanosonata No.7\tFrederic Rzewski Beta Collide 2:42\nYellow\tStephen Vitiello Beta Collide 4:44\nNude\tRadiohead Beta Collide 2:10\n\n\n== See also ==\nFestival Internacional Cervantino\n\n\n== References =="

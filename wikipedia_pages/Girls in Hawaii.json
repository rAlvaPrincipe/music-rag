    "text": "Girls in Hawaii is a Belgian indie pop band.\nGirls in Hawaii's first release was Found in the Ground: The Winter EP in early 2003, after which the band toured Belgium and France. In the meantime they started recording what would become their first LP.\nFrom Here To There was released in November 2003 in Belgium and in early 2004 in Europe. It was well-received across Europe, where the band went on a promotional tour through Belgium, France, Italy, Germany and Spain. The record was later released in Japan and, in October 2005, China Shop Music released it in the United States. The band started a short tour of the West Coast of the United States in April 2006.\nTheir second full-length album, Plan Your Escape, was released in February 2008 in Europe. It was recorded in old houses in the Ardennes Forest by producer Jean Lamoot (who has worked with French artists such as Noir Désir and Alain Bashung). The album, more complex and eclectic than the previous, contains twelve songs; the first single was called \"This Farm Will End Up in Fire\". The band toured Europe promoting the album during 2008.\nIn February 2009 Not Here, a documentary relating the life of the band during that tour, was released on DVD.\nOn 30 May 2010, 28 year-old drummer Denis Wielemans died in a car accident in Brussels.\nIn 2012 they started working on their third album, Everest. The album was released on 2 September 2013. In the summer of 2014, they released a new EP, Refuge.\nIn October 2014, they released a live album, Hello Strange, which revisits old songs in an acoustic and/or electronic way.\nIn September 2017, they released Nocturne, their fourth album.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\nAntoine Wielemans – vocals, guitar\nLionel Vancauwenberghe – vocals, guitar\nFrançois Gustin – guitar, keyboard\nDaniel Offermann – bass\nBrice Vancauwenberghe – guitar\nBoris Gronemberger – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n2003: Found in the Ground: The Winter EP (62TV Records)\n\n\n=== Contributions ===\n2007: \"Out on the Weekend\" in Sounds Eclectic: The Covers Project\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGirls in Hawaii on MySpace\nOfficial Blog Archived 27 February 2008 at the Wayback Machine (in French)\nOfficial Website"

    "text": "Krewella is an American electronic dance music band from the Chicago suburb of Northbrook, Illinois, United States, that formed in 2007. Their musical style has been mainly described as EDM, dance-rock, and dance-pop. However, Krewella's style has been influenced by a number of electronic sub genres, including progressive house, electro, dubstep, drum and bass, trap music and future bass.\nTheir debut EP, Play Hard, was released on June 18, 2012, exclusively on Beatport, followed by its release on other digital platforms on June 26, 2012. Later, their debut album, Get Wet, was released on September 24, 2013, on iTunes.\nThe band consists of sisters Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf. Originally a trio, their third member and producer Kristopher Trindl left the band in 2014. The band's name stems from Jahan's misspelling of the word \"cruel\" when the two began writing music, and is not a reference to Cruella de Vil.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2007–2013: Formation and career beginnings ===\nKrewella formed in 2007 and consisted of sisters Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf, together with producer Kris Trindl. Jahan and Kris met at a Glenbrook North High School party in 2006. They were in a relationship. Their relationship ended in 2011. Their music is a blend of self-produced electro house and dubstep, with influences of many other EDM styles. All three members of the band have \"6-8-10\" tattoos to commemorate June 8, 2010, the day when the three agreed to give up their careers, schooling, and any other intentions for their lives, to dedicate all of their time to the band's joint music career. In December 2011, they were signed to Canadian independent electronic music label Monstercat; \"Killin' It\" was Krewella's first original song released by a label. Monstercat promoted Krewella with social media campaigns and partnered with EDM YouTube promotional channels for a larger platform. In June 2012, Krewella released their EP Play Hard. The second single, \"Alive\" peaked at number one on the US Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart and also placed on the US Billboard Hot 100.\nKrewella has headlined at EDM festivals around the globe including Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, Stereosonic, Spring Awakening, Sunburn Festival and Paradiso festival. These live performances earned them the 2012 International Dance Music Award for \"Best Breakthrough Artist.\"\nAfter their performance at Ultra Music Festival 2013, Billboard declared that \"Krewella is going to be huge!\" Their debut album Get Wet charted in the Top 10 of the US Billboard 200 in its first week. Krewella teamed up with producer group Cash Cash to make their second single \"Live For The Night\".\n\n\n=== 2014–2015: Lawsuit, Trindl's departure and Somewhere to Run ===\nIn January 2014, Krewella partnered with EDM lifestyle brand Electric Family to produce a collaboration bracelet for which 100% of the proceeds are donated to Dance For Paralysis. The partnership has raised over $17,000 as of April 2014.\nOn September 20, 2014 it was announced that Trindl is no longer part of Krewella. Trindl subsequently filed a lawsuit against the sisters for $5 million, claiming that he was unfairly \"thrown out\" of the band. The Yousaf sisters countersued, claiming Trindl had drug and alcohol problems, \"pretended to DJ\" onstage, and ultimately resigned from the band.\nOn November 24, 2014, Krewella released their first single following Trindl's departure titled \"Say Goodbye\", which was initially available for free download. The track reflects on the loss of a member and the lawsuit against the Yousaf sisters.\nOn March 23, 2015, Krewella released \"Somewhere to Run\" produced by Pegboard Nerds and others.\nIn June 2015, Krewella's \"Somewhere to Run\" was featured in the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority's \"Krewellavator\" marketing campaign. The spot was filmed in an actual elevator at the MGM Grand Las Vegas.\nKrewella released Troll mix Vol. 14 - Return of the Trolls on August 15, 2015, its title a reference to the time gap following the previous one. This mix is the first released after Trindl's departure. The hour long mix features a new track from the sisters, named \"Surrender the Throne\". It also includes a new remix of their single \"Somewhere to Run\".\nThe sisters were featured on the single \"Love Song to the Earth\" alongside; Paul McCartney, Jon Bon Jovi, Sheryl Crow, Fergie, Colbie Caillat, Natasha Bedingfield, Leona Lewis, Sean Paul, Johnny Rzeznik, Angélique Kidjo, Kelsea Ballerini, Nicole Scherzinger, Christina Grimmie, Victoria Justice and Q'orianka Kilcher.\nIn August 2015, it was announced that Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf had settled the lawsuit with Kris Trindl out-of-court.

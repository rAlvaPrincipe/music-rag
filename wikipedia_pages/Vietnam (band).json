    "text": "Vietnam is a rock, post-punk and new wave band from Atlanta, Georgia on Scared Records. Vietnam first appeared at the dawn of a new decadeâ€”the 80's, and ushered in a fresh era of music to the Atlanta new wave scene. Embraced by the early 80's cavalcade of Athens bands such as R.E.M., Pylon, Method Actors,  Love Tractor, etc., Vietnam wowed the patrons of the legendary 688 club, 40 Watt club, and the Agora Ballroom. Their first performance was opening for Public Image Ltd. in April 1980, and the next year they played the Noise Fest in New York, appearing on the ZG compilation release of the same name along with Sonic Youth, Glenn Branca, Y Pants and others. They released their first full-length album on Scared Records in 2004, Past Away.\n\n\n== Current members ==\nStan Satin: lead vocals, saxophone, percussion\nDavid Dean: drums, backing vocals, moog synthesiser, steel drum, percussion\nDavid Watkins: drums, percussion\nLaurie G-Force: bass, backing vocals\nKen Schenck: electric guitar\n\n\n== Previous members ==\nDrew Davidson: electric guitar\nTim Hunter: bass, drums, synthesizer\nSue Garner: synthesizer, b.vocals, congas, steel drum\nBruce Sehorne: bass\nLee Self: bass, b.vocals\nJohn Stratton: percussion\nJ.E.

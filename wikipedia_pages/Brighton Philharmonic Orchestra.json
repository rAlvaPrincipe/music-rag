    "text": "Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra (BPO) is a professional orchestra based in Brighton & Hove, England, performing regularly at Brighton Dome and other venues across the city.\nThe BPO was founded in 1925 by Herbert Menges \"to give periodical concerts of a high standard in Brighton and Hove\". The orchestra moved into Brighton Dome in 1928 and by 1932 had appointed Sir Thomas Beecham as its first President, a position later held by Ralph Vaughan Williams and Benjamin Britten.\nThe BPO is now led by Music Director Joanna MacGregor CBE and in 2024-2025 celebrates its Centenary season.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nIn May 1925, Herbert Menges and his mother Kate formed the Symphonic String Players, with the purpose of becoming \"a large and powerful String Orchestra, and to give periodical concerts of a high standard in Brighton and Hove\". The orchestra initially performed in Hove Town Hall with Molly Paley as the first leader.  By 1928, the orchestra had moved to Brighton Dome and had adopted the name Symphonic Players.  The Dome, originally riding stables, had been converted into a concert hall in 1867.  In 1932 Sir Thomas Beecham was appointed as the orchestra's first President, although Menges continued as Principal Conductor. Performers during this period included Joseph Szigeti, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Henry Wood, Adrian Boult, Moura Lympany, Myra Hess and Clifford Curzon.\n\n\n=== 1940s to 1980s ===\nDuring World War II, the Symphonic Players put on regular concerts, sometimes in conjunction with the London Philharmonic Orchestra under the leadership of Malcolm Sargent.  In 1942 they organised a week-long music festival at which many soloists of the era performed, as did the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra.  In 1945, the orchestra became the fully-professional Southern Philharmonic.  \"An ambitious scheme for its future development\" was proposed and was accepted by Brighton Borough Council, which agreed to provide £1,000 to cover any losses made. \nThe same amount came from the lessees of Brighton Racecourse, and the Arts Council of Great Britain also provided funding.  At this time the orchestra travelled to other towns on many occasions, giving concerts at Eastbourne, Hastings, Portsmouth, Southampton, Folkestone and Swindon.  Ralph Vaughan Williams took over the position of President in 1947, and the orchestra had guest appearances from Malcolm Sargent, Yehudi Menuhin, Rosalyn Tureck, Norman Del Mar and William Walton.\nIn 1958 the name Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra was adopted.  In 1967 the orchestra appointed Benjamin Britten as President, with concerts including Jacqueline du Pré, Alfred Brendel, André Previn, Brighton Festival Chorus and Mstislav Rostropovich.  This was despite \"a succession of financial crises\" which were averted by funding received from the Arts Council, Brighton Borough Council and Southern Television, the local ITV broadcasting licence holder.  The orchestra was also one of several that performed at the inaugural Brighton Festival in 1967.\nIn 1972, after 47 years as Principal Conductor and having conducted more than 300 concerts, Menges died at the age of 69. His successor was John Carewe, whose first concert as Principal Conductor marked the start of the orchestra's 50th Anniversary season.\n\n\n=== 1980 to present ===\nIn 1989 Barry Wordsworth was appointed as the orchestra's Music Director and Principal Conductor. When Brighton Dome closed for refurbishment that same year, the BPO returned temporarily to Hove Town Hall and presented a series of Mozart Piano Concerto concerts in Brighton's Theatre Royal with its then President, John Lill. \nBrighton Dome reopened in 2002 and BPO returned to its home venue. In 2012 the BPO gave one of the first performances of Moeran's Symphony No.2, conducted by Martin Yates (who had recently reconstructed the piece). Later seasons saw premieres of new works by Will Todd, Richard Rodney Bennett, Martin Butler and Howard Goodall, as well as regular collaborations with Brighton Festival Chorus and Brighton Festival Chorus Youth Choir.\nThe orchestra celebrated its 90th concert season in 2014/15, including a performance of Franz Schubert's Marche Militaire, which was performed at the Symphonic String Players' first concert in May 1925. Wordsworth stepped down at the end of the season and became the BPO's first Conductor Laureate.\nIn 2019, Joanna MacGregor CBE was appointed as the orchestra's fourth Music Director and Principal Conductor. In 2024/25 the orchestra celebrates its Centenary season, with guest appearances from Evelyn Glennie and Jess Gillam and culminating in a gala performance of Messiaen's Turangalîla Symphony.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography =="

    "text": "Kneebody is an American band formed in 2001, consisting of Adam Benjamin on keyboards, Shane Endsley on trumpet, Ben Wendel on tenor saxophone, and Nate Wood on bass guitar and drums.\n\n\n== History ==\nBen Wendel, Shane Endsley, Adam Benjamin, and Kaveh Rastegar met in the late 1990s as students at the Eastman School of Music. Benjamin later transferred to CalArts, where he met Nate Wood. After graduating Eastman, Wendel and Rastegar moved to Los Angeles, and the band got its start at the Temple Bar and The Vic in Santa Monica, California, where they played a weekly residency. The name of the band was a nonsense word invented by Wendel's girlfriend, so that the band had no clear leader and no clear musical connotations.\nIn 2005, the band's self-titled debut album was released on Dave Douglas' Greenleaf Music label. In 2007, they released their next album, Low Electrical Worker, to further critical acclaim (Joshua Redman declared it one of his favorite albums of 2007).\nIn February 2019, it was announced that Rastegar would be leaving the group to focus on other projects, with Wood taking on bass along with playing drums.\nIn May 2019 the band released the EP By Fire, consisting of covers and guest-vocalists via the label Edition Records.\n\n\n== Style and influences ==\nAccording to Nate Chinen, writing in The New York Times, Kneebody is \"a resolutely un-pindownable band\" acclaimed for their eclectic style, which \"uses a common jazz instrumentation to make a somewhat less common amalgam of urban-signifying genres, from electro-pop to punk-rock to hip-hop.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nAdam Benjamin - keyboards\nShane Endsley - trumpet\nBen Wendel - tenor sax\nNate Wood - bass, drums\n\n\n=== Former ===\nKaveh Rastegar - bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nKneebody (Greenleaf, 2005)\nLow Electrical Worker (Colortone, 2007)\nTwelve Songs by Charles Ives with Theo Bleckmann (Winter & Winter, 2008)\nYou Can Have Your Moment (Winter & Winter, 2010)\nThe Line (Concord, 2013)\nKneedelus  with Daedelus (Brainfeeder, 2015)\nAnti-Hero (Motema, 2017)\nChapters (Edition, 2019)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nKneebody Live: Volume One (2007)\nKneebody Live: Volume Two: Live in Italy (2009)\nKneebody Live: Volume Three: Live in Paris (2011)\nKneebody Live Fall Tour 2003 (2021)\nLive at Le Crescent (Edition 2022)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nBy Fire (2019)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSolomon, Jon (September 30, 2013). \"Kneebody's Kaveh Rastegar recalls the band's early Denver roots, jamming at Muddy's\".

It peaked at number 6 on the ARIA charts.\nAbout the album, Ceberano said \"This album was conceived and the orchestra recorded in the last months before the Covid blackout. After several years of waiting to complete it, when I finally got to return to the project and record the vocals it was a very emotional experience for me... back in a studio where i had recorded Brave 35 years before â€“ and with my daughter now singing backing vocals. I never wanted to take anything for granted again. I was more committed, bolder, and more willing to back my stories and songwriting. The power of the orchestra, the arrangements by my talented friend Roscoe have given new life to songs that together we cherrypicked from my albums over the years. Songs that are meaningful to me, earmarking personal memories and travelling with me across 4 decades.\"\nAt the 2023 ARIA Music Awards, the album was nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Album.\nAt the AIR Awards of 2024, the album was nominated for Best Independent Pop Album or EP.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFemale called the album a \"breathtaking celebration of Kates's songwriting from across her 40-year recording career.\"\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe album debuted at number 6 on the ARIA chart.

    "text": "The Monteverdi Choir was founded in 1964 by Sir John Eliot Gardiner for a performance of the Vespro della Beata Vergine in King's College Chapel, Cambridge. A specialist Baroque ensemble, the Choir has become famous for its stylistic conviction and extensive repertoire, encompassing music from the Renaissance period to Classical music of the 20th century. They often appear with the English Baroque Soloists and Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, also founded by John Eliot Gardiner.\nIn 2000, the 250th anniversary of Johann Sebastian Bach's death, the choir undertook the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, performing and recording most of his church cantatas in more than 60 historic churches throughout Europe, and some in the U.S.\nOn 5 March 2014 the Choir celebrated its 50th anniversary with a repeat performance of the Monteverdi Vespers from King's College Chapel, in a live broadcast live by BBC Radio 3. In 2023, it was one of the choirs selected to sing at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla. The Choir together with the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique toured Europe with Berlioz's Les Troyens, conducted by Dinis Sousa, in the summer of 2023. The Choir was named ‘Best Choir’ at the Oper! Awards ceremony held at the Dutch National Opera in Amsterdam on 29 January 2024.\nIn July 2024, it was announced that John Eliot Gardiner was resigning as Artistic Director of the choir.\n\n\n== Bach Cantata Pilgrimage ==\nIn 2000 the Choir, with the English Baroque Soloists, undertook an ambitious tour, the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, in which it performed almost all of Johann Sebastian Bach's church cantatas in more than 60 churches in Europe, the UK and the US to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the composer's death. The dates followed the occasions of the liturgical year for which Bach had assigned his compositions. Some of the churches are connected to Bach's life.\nRecordings of a number of the cantatas were released by Deutsche Grammophon on the Archiv label. However, most of the recordings made during the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage have been released in 28 volumes on Gardiner's own label, Soli Deo Gloria (recordings released by Deutsche Grammophon will not be released again on Soli Deo Gloria). The series was completed in 2012 with a live recording in London of cantatas for Ascension Day that were performed in Salisbury during the pilgrimage, but were not recorded for technical reasons.  It is possible that some cantatas which were not performed during the pilgrimage will be added to the recording project, such as works for the inauguration of the Leipzig town council.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAll recordings mentioned are with the English Baroque Soloists or Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, conducted by Sir John Eliot Gardiner, unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n=== Johann Sebastian Bach ===\n\n\n==== Cantatas ====\nEaster Cantatas: BWV 6, BWV 66 — 2000 — Archiv Produktion 463 580-2\nCantatas: BWV 106, BWV 118/BWV 231, BWV 198 — 1990 — Archiv Produktion 463 581-2\nCantatas for the 3rd Sunday after Epiphany: BWV 72, BWV 73, BWV 111, BWV 156 — 2000 — Archiv Produktion 463 582-2( recorded live on the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, Milan, January 2000)\nCantatas for Ascension Day: BWV 43, BWV 128, BWV 37, BWV 11 — 2000 — Archiv Produktion 463 583-2\nWhitsun Cantatas: BWV 172, BWV 59, BWV 74, BWV 34 — 2000 — Archiv Produktion 463 584-2\nCantatas for the Feast of the Purification of Mary: BWV 83, BWV 82, BWV 125, BWV 200 — 2000 — Archiv Produktion 463 585-2 (recorded live on the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, Christchurch, February 2000)\nCantatas: BWV 98, BWV 139, BWV 16 — 2000 — Archiv Produktion 463 586-2\nCantatas: BWV 140, BWV 147 — 1992 — Archiv Produktion 463 587-2\nAdvent Cantatas: BWV 61, BWV 36, BWV 62 — 1992 — Archiv Produktion 463 588-2\nChristmas Cantatas: BWV 63, BWV 64, BWV 121, BWV 133 — 2000 — Archiv Produktion 463 589-2\nCantatas for the 9th Sunday after Trinity: BWV 94, BWV 168, BWV 105 — 2000 — Archiv Produktion 463 590-2 (recorded live on the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, Merano, August 2000)\nCantatas for the 11th Sunday after Trinity: BWV 179, BWV 199, BWV 113 — 2000 — Archiv Produktion 463 591-2 (recorded live on the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, St Davids, September 2000)\nCantatas for the 2nd Sunday after Epiphany: BWV 155, BWV 3, BWV 13 and Cantatas for the 4th Sunday after Epiphany: BWV BWV 81, BWV 14, BWV 26, Motet BWV 227 (2 CDs) — 2005 — SDG 115\nCantatas for the Feast of St. John the Baptist: BWV 167, BWV 7, BWV 30 and Cantatas for the 1st Sunday after Trinity: BWV 75, BWV 20, BWV 39 (2 CDs) — 2005 — SDG 101\nCantatas for the 15th Sunday after Trinity: BWV 138, BWV 99, BWV 51, BWV 100 and Cantatas for the 16th Sunday after Trinity: BWV 161, BWV 27, BWV 8, BWV 95 (2 CDs) —2005 — SDG 104\nCantatas for the 3rd Sunday after Easter (Jubilate): BWV 12, BWV 103, BWV 146 and Cantatas for the 4th Sunday after Easter: BWV 166, BWV 108, BWV 117 (2 CDs) — 2005 — SDG 107\nCantatas for the 19th Sunday after Trinity: BWV 48, BWV 5, BWV 90, BWV 56 and Cantatas for the Feast of the Reformation: BWV 79, BWV 192, BWV 80 (2 CDs) — 2005 — SDG 110\nAlles mit Gott, BWV 1127 & Arias and Choruses from Cantatas BWV 71, BWV 78, BWV 151, BWV 155, BWV 159, BWV 182, BWV 190 — 2005 — SDG 114\nCantatas for the Christmas Day & for the 2nd day of Christmas: BWV 91, BWV 121, BWV 40, BWV 110 — 2005 — SDG 113\n\n\n==== Other works ====\nMass in B minor, BWV 232 — 1985 — Archiv Produktion 415 514-2\nSt Matthew Passion, BWV 244 — 1989 — Archiv Produktion 427 648-2\nSt John Passion, BWV 245 — 1986 — Archiv Produktion 419 324-2\nMagnificat, BWV 243 and Cantata BWV 51 (with Emma Kirkby) — 1985 — Philips Classics 464 672-2\n\n\n=== Other composers ===\n\n\n==== Claudio Monteverdi ====\nVespro della Beata Vergine (with the Monteverdi Orchestra) — 1975 —  Decca SET 593-4\nVespro della Beata Vergine and Magnificat a sei voci — 1990 — Archiv Produktion 429 565-2\nVespro della Beata Vergine and motets by Giovanni Gabrieli, Giovanni Bassano & Claudio Monteverdi (2 CDs) — 1994 — Decca\n\n\n==== Alessandro Scarlatti ====\nStabat Mater — 2020 — Erato OCLC 1154312842\n\n\n==== Antonio Vivaldi ====\nGloria in D major, RV 589 — 2001 — Philips Classics 462 597-2\n\n\n==== George Frideric Handel ====\nMessiah — 1982 — Philips Classics 411 041-2\nDixit Dominus —2001 — Philips Classics 462 597-2\nSemele (live) — 2019 — SDG733\n\n\n==== Christoph Willibald Gluck ====\nOrfeo ed Euridice — 1993 — Philips Classics 434 093-2\n\n\n==== Joseph Haydn ====\nDie Jahreszeiten (The Seasons), Hob.

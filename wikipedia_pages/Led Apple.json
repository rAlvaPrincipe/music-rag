    "text": "Led Apple (Korean: 레드애플; stylized as LEDApple) was a South Korean rock band formed by StarKim Entertainment in 2010. The band's final lineup consisted of Seo Youngjun (Jun), Lee Kyumin (Kei) and Kim Hyoseok (AKi)\nThe part \"Led\" in LEDApple stood for \"Logic Egoism Delete\" and was promoted during their debut but they stopped referring to it since their CODA mini-album was released. Instead they replaced it with a practical explanation of \"shining as brightly as LED whenever they perform\" which was eventually referred to as a tribute to their role-model, Led Zeppelin. The word \"Apple\" in the band's name is supposed to represent their fresh image as idols and fresh music that they release. On August 16, 2015, it was announced that the band would be changing their name to LedT starting on September 1, 2015.\nThe band made their debut on October 6, 2010, with their promotional single, \"Dash\" (Korean: 대쉬), a remake of Baek Ji-young's song of the same name. Since their debut, the band have released six singles and three mini-albums. The band disbanded March 6, 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: Debut and line-up changes ===\nPrior to debut, member Minyong had been a contestant on the show Superstar K. The band was first revealed on September 27, 2010, as a five-member group and marketed as a new \"idol rock band\". The teaser for their debut single was released on September 29. On October 6, 2010, Led Apple performed their debut promotional single \"Dash\", which is a remake of a song originally sung by Baek Ji-young at the Busan International Film Festival and the music video was released the next day. The band's single was released alongside their single album, Logic Egoism Delete. They later performed the promotional single on November 11, 2010, on Mnet's M! Countdown as their debut stage.\nOn February 1, 2011, member I-OH announced his departure from the group on Twitter due to tuberculosis, however he did state that he would remain with the company. Vocalists of the group Minyong and Sunghyun later left for personal reasons that were not publicly revealed. Three new members joined the band for the release of their mini-album, Niga Mwonde (Korean: 니가 뭔데; lit. Who Do You Think You Are); Hyoseok, Jaehoon and Kyumin with Jaehoon becoming leader of the band. On June 13, 2011, the band released a comeback teaser for their mini-album and title track of the same name. However, the teaser was criticized for featuring the band in a club and drinking alcohol. Three members of Led Apple were minors at the time, and so the teaser was considered a bad influence towards youths.\nThe band's first mini-album, Niga Mwonde and lead single of the same name were released on June 15, 2011, alongside two different music videos; a regular version and a drama version. However, the band faced another controversy after many internet communities claimed that Led Apple's single \"Niga Mwonde\" had plagiarized CN Blue's song, \"Love\". However, Starkim Entertainment later released a statement addressing the plagiarism issue, stating that both songs were composed by Lee Sang-ho which is why they sounded similar. \nOn July 19, 2011, Led Apple released their second promotional single from the mini-album Niga Mwonde, \"Birthday Killer\". The song was released in an attempt to make anti-fans realise that their hate comments can cause idols to do extreme things out of their misery. The music video was praised for being \"powerful\" in bringing out a message by critics and fans alike. However the song was not a commercial success and didn't manage to peak within the top one-hundred on the Gaon Chart.\nAfter ending their promotions for the Niga Mwonde mini-album, leader Jaehoon left the band citing personal reasons; no other information was disclosed. On October 28, 2011, the band announced a new member would be joining them for their upcoming single, Keon U who is well known as the son of famous composer, Park Kwang-hyun. Another new member, Hanbyul was also announced on November 3 as the new appointed leader of the group alongside teaser photos of the rest of the band, thus making them a six-member group.\nOn November 7, the teaser for their next mini-album, CODA was released and it also revealed Led Apple's new sci-fi concept. An extended nine-minute version of the teaser was also released on November 9 and was dubbed the \"drama teaser\". The music video for their next single, \"Eojjeoda Majuchin\" (Korean: 어쩌다 마주친; lit. Ran Into You By Chance) was released on November 11 and it featured former SeeYa member, Nam Gyu-ri as a cyborg and love interest in the video. In the week beginning December 2, the band's mini-album, CODA managed to reach an impressive number six on the Gaon Chart. On December 15, 2011, Led Apple was nominated for the \"Anticipated Super Rookies for 2012\" award at the Wave K Super Rookies Awards. The band managed to achieve the third highest number of votes for the award losing out to RaNia and B1A4, respectively.\n\n\n=== 2012–2014: K-Rookies Party, Vol. 1 and solo concerts ===\nOn January 29, 2012, Led Apple revealed a teaser for their newest single, \"Time Is Up\". It was later announced that Led Apple appointed the new leader of the band to be Youngjun. On February 2, the band made their comeback stage on Mnet's M! Countdown with their newest single, \"Time Is Up\" and the song was released the next day. The music video was released on February 6 and the single was heavily promoted on music shows. On February 12, it was announced that Led Apple would star in their own reality television show titled, Led Apple Entertainment where the six members have to start up and control their own fictional entertainment company whilst also having trainee singers join their company. The show began airing on February 15 and the final episode aired on March 21 on SBS MTV.\nOn March 5, Led Apple announced on their Facebook page that the band would cease their promotions for \"Time Is Up\" and be releasing a new digital single titled, \"Sadness\". Their single was released on March 9 and they also performed it on KBS's Music Bank as their comeback stage. On March 16, the band made their Japanese debut after attending the K-Rookies Party, Vol. 1 concert that took place in the Nakano Sun Plaza in Tokyo, Japan. The band performed four of their songs as part of the concert's finale and later expressed their desire to come back to Japan during the press conference. On March 26, Led Apple released the music video for \"Sadness\" and the song peaked at number 58 on the Gaon Chart.\nAfter ending their promotions for \"Sadness\", the group announced that they would be holding their first solo concert titled, Now Playing – Led Apple in Seoul, Vol. 1. The concert took place on May 11, at the Soundholic City in Seoul. It also featured the band, Toxic, the winner of KBS2's Band Survival: TOP band as guest performers. Due to the success of their first solo concert, the band held two extra provincial concerts in Daegu and Busan on May 18 and 19, respectively. The group also announced their return to Japan with their second solo concert. Their second solo concert was held on June 23, at the Shinagawa Prince Stellar Ball in Tokyo, however Keon U was unable to perform alongside the group due to health problems.\nOn July 5, 2012, Led Apple released a music video for their song \"Run To You\" from their third mini-album \"Run To You\". The song is currently being promoted on music shows.

Led apple has hinted that they would be continuing the series as soon as possible.\nOn June 16, 2013, Led apple released their third mini album \"Bad Boys\".

A bit later a Japanese version of it was also made.\n\n\n=== 2014–2016 Line-up changes and disbandment ===\nOn October 28, 2014, not long after the celebration of LED Apple's 4th anniversary, it was confirmed that Hanbyul, Kyumin, and Kwangyeon would be leaving LED Apple. Hanbyul stated that his desire to pursue a solo career motivated his choice to leave the group, whilst Kyumin asserted that he wanted to launch himself into the Hip-Hop genre.

On top of this, by adding the superb dance performance that could not be found in the existing bands, they are gaining attention in and out of Korea with the unique concept of ‘Dance-Rock Band’ which lets the audience enjoy the stage with them”.\nIn 2016, the group disbanded.\n\n\n== 2014: International Tour ==\n\n\n=== European Tour ===\n\n\n=== Japanese Tour ===\n\n\n=== 2nd European Tour ===\n\n\n=== LEDApple 2014 The Last Live Tour 「ありがとね　LEDA」 ===\n\n\n== Former members ==\nI-OH (이오)\nSunghyun (성현)\nMinyong (민용)\nJaehoon (재훈)\nKeon U (건우)\nHanbyul (한별)\nKwangyeon (광연)\nKyo (교)\nJUN (준)\nAKi (아키)\nKei (케이)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Single albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Soundtrack appearances ===\n2012: \"Smile Again\" - Lovers of Haeundae OST\n2013: \"Going to You\" - Bel Ami OST\n2014: \"Call My Name\" - Marriage, Not Dating OST\n\n\n== Tours and concerts ==\n\n\n=== Main concerts ===\nNow Playing – Led Apple in Seoul, Vol. 1 (2012)\nLEDApple 1st Concert in Japan (2012)\nLEDApple World Tour Concert (2014) - Japan, Netherlands, Romania, Germany, Italy, Greece\nHot Summer with (2014) - Tokyo, Osaka\nHot Summer in (2014) - France, Germany, Poland\nLEDApple Mini Tour in Europe (2014) - Austria, Russia, Finland\nLEDApple 2014 The Last Live Tour 「ありがとね　LEDA (Thank you, LEDA)」 (2014) - Shibuya, Osaka, Tokyo\n\n\n=== Guest participation ===\nK-Rookies Party, Vol. 1 (2012)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

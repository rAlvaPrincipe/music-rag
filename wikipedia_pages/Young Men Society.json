One of their friends came up with the group's name and initially they thought it sounded \"corny\", however the name eventually grew on them and they have since loved it. Josh Fonmoa was born and raised in Sydney, while Andi Tahta originally came from Jakarta, Indonesia, and Nathan Tamati from England. At the age of 10, Tahta and his family relocated to Australia \"in search of a better life\".

All members worked together in retail and as dance teachers.\n\n\n=== 2011: The X Factor Australia ===\nYoung Men Society successfully auditioned for the third season of The X Factor Australia in 2011, singing Mike Posner's \"Cooler Than Me\".

They decided to record their first single titled \"We Own the Night\" as independent artists and filmed their own music video for the song. In an interview with The Music Network, Tahta stated \"After the show we actually didn't have any kind of [label] options, there was a point in time where we were really down, but we just told ourselves, 'Let's just keep going, let's make this track, let's just keep recording, let's do a video for it\". Sony Music Australia were impressed with the single and its accompanying video, and decided to sign Young Men Society to their record label.\nDuring January and February 2012, Young Men Society were supporting acts for Justice Crew's Sexy and I Know It Tour.

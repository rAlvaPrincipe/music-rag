    "text": "The 116, formerly 116 Clique (pronounced one-one-six click), is an American Southern Christian hip hop collective originally from Dallas, Texas signed to the Atlanta-based Reach Records. The group performs a wide variety of contemporary hip hop styles, from chopped and screwed to trap to Latin hip hop. The 116 Clique is named after the Bible verse Romans 1:16: \"For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.\" For them it means acknowledging the power of the Gospel and the divine calling to proclaim it in every area of their life. \"We can lay our lives down to serve and glorify God in everything we do.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group debuted with The Compilation Album in 2005. DJ Primo remixed the original recordings the following year with The Compilation Album: Chopped and Screwed. The remix album included four bonus tracks. In 2007 they released 13 Letters, the album name representing the 13 letters Paul wrote to first-century Christians. In 2011 they released the Man Up compilation album. Man Up was intended for release on July 23, 2011. However, the official release date was pushed back to September 27, 2011. A corresponding film, directed by former member Sho Baraka, was made to show the importance of a godly man. The Man Up Movie & Concert Series tour took place in selected cities where fans could see a screening of Man Up followed by a concert with songs from the soundtrack. They released a single, \"Come Alive\", based on their 2012 Unashamed Tour. in 2013, the clique released \"Now They Know\", based on the Unashamed Tour V. On November 23, 2018, a digital Christmas album was released, entitled The Gift: A Christmas Compilation, and made available through most major streaming services. A playlist of some 14 songs, entitled \"Summer 19\" was released on July 19, 2019 by Reach under the auspices of the group. On October 23, 2020, 116 released Sin Vergüenza, a collaboration between Reach and No Apologies Music which features a combination of American hip hop and Latin urbano artists. All two dozen tracks were released as singles.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nThe Compilation Album (2005)\nThe Compilation Album: Chopped and Screwed (2006)\n13 Letters (2007)\nMan Up (2011)\n116 Summer Eighteen (2018)\nThe Gift: A Christmas Compilation (2018)\n116 Summer Nineteen (2019)\n116 Summer Twenty (2020)\nSin Vergüenza (2020)\n116 Summer Twenty-One (2021)\n116 Summer Twenty-Two (2022)\n116 Summer Twenty-Three (2023)\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\nIn 2008, Lecrae, Trip Lee, Sho Baraka and Tedashii went on the Unashamed Tour.

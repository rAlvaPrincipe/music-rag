    "text": "Stelsi is a Ukrainian electro-folk/synthpop/electronic dance music group, founded in 1999 by Alex Kukharsky in Chernivtsi, Bukovina, Ukraine. The band is credited as one of the first electronic music acts in Ukraine, with a fusion of styles that quickly grew into mainstream popularity at the beginning of the 2000s. The band's sound evolved from big-beat, techno, house and other club-oriented genres (2000-2003); up to more live performance synthpop\\alternative\\rock music (2003-2005), eventually incorporating ethnic\\folk elements. This resulted in a style fusion that was called \"electro-folk\" by critics and the press (2005–present). The band's music can be frequently heard in commercials, radio & TV shows, presentations, sports events and other media throughout Ukraine.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAlex Kukharsky - vocals, lyrics, synth, keyboards, producer\nAleksandr “Gunya” Vereninov - guitar, lyrics\nMykola “Sniper” Kobyliuk - synth, keyboards, sampling, backing vocals, lyrics\nSerhiy Palka - Bass, backing vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nTotal Synth-ethics (Суцільна Синт-етика) (2001)\nSunrise (Сонцесхід) (2002)\nModel (Модель) (EP) (2003)\nAliens (2004)\nTam...

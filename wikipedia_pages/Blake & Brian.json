    "text": "Blake & Brian was an American country music duo composed of singer-songwriters Brian Gowan (born January 7, 1969, in Temple, Texas) and Blake Weldon (September 13, 1966, in Lufkin, Texas).\nThe two were paired up by record producer Chuck Howard in 1995. Their self-titled debut album was issued in 1997 on the Curb Records label. The album's lead-off single, \"Another Perfect Day\", peaked at No. 45 on the Billboard country charts. Country Standard Time gave the album a mixed review, stating that although Gowan and Weldon were \"indistinguishable vocally and equally malleable\", and although some of the songs were derivative of the Eagles, the more up-tempo tracks were \"punch[ed] up... with timeless Texas kick\". After releasing this album, they charted two more singles (\"The Wish\" and \"Amnesia\"), the latter of which was not included on an album. By 1999, Blake & Brian had parted ways. Gowan released a solo album entitled Warm Spanish Wine in 2000. He also co-wrote Rodney Atkins' 1997 debut single \"In a Heartbeat\" and three songs on Atkins' 2003 debut album Honesty.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Blake & Brian (1997) ===\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\n\"If Guitars Were Guns\" (Brian Gowan, Roger Alan Wade) – 2:21\n\"Why, Why, Why\" (Mark Selby, Doug Hughes) – 2:33\n\"Saving My Love\" (Blake Weldon, Tony Stampley) – 3:43\n\"The Wish\" (Conley White, Sam Hogin, Phil Barnhart) – 3:44\n\"There Is No End\" (Weldon, Bill Rice, Sharon Rice) – 3:29\n\"Straight to You\" (Lee Satterfield, George Teren) – 2:44\n\"Another Perfect Day\" (White, Barnhart, Brian Tabor) – 3:26\n\"Shut Up Heart\" (Michael Huffman, Rick Williamson) – 2:27\n\"Confederate Rose\" (Max T.

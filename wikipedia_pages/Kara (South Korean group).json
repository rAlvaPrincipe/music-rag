    "text": "Kara (Korean: 카라; Japanese: カラ; often stylized in all caps)  is a South Korean girl group formed by DSP Media in 2007. The group's current lineup is Gyuri, Seungyeon, Nicole, Jiyoung, and Youngji. Kara made their debut in March 2007 with their first studio album, The First Bloooooming, and its title track, \"Break It.\" Originally a quartet composed of Park Gyuri, Han Seungyeon, Nicole Jung, and Kim Sunghee, Kara showcased a strong female image and a mature R&B sound. Expectations for the group were high because they were considered the successors to their senior labelmates, Fin.K.L; however, their debut was a commercial failure. The following year, Sunghee left the group due education issues and parental pressure, and members Goo Hara and Kang Jiyoung were added.\nAfter the addition of the new members, Kara's image and musical style changed to a \"pretty but natural\" concept with the release of their first mini-album, Rock U, in July 2008. Following the change in concept, Kara saw an increase in recognition. In 2009, they achieved their first music show win with \"Honey\", and after performing their single \"Mister,\" the popularity of its \"butt dance\" choreography further increased Kara's popularity. Follow-up singles \"Lupin\" (2010), \"Jumping\" (2010), \"Step\" (2011), and \"Pandora\" (2012), also sold and charted well. After establishing success in Korea, Kara began to promote their music in Japan by signing to Universal Music Japan's subsidiary label, Universal Sigma, in 2010. Following their commercially successful debut, Kara achieved their first number one single in Japan with \"Jet Coaster Love\" in April 2011, marking the first time a foreign female group topped the singles chart in 30 years.\nWithin their first two years of promoting in Japan, Kara sold over one million physical singles, making them one of the fastest-selling South Korean acts in Japan. In 2014, Nicole and Jiyoung decided not to renew their contracts with DSP Media and left the group. Following their departures, a reality TV show titled Kara Project aired to select a new member to join the group. Seven trainees from DSP Media took part in the program, and the winner, Heo Youngji, became the last member to join Kara. With this four-member lineup, Kara released two more singles in South Korea: \"Mamma Mia\" (2014) and \"Cupid\" (2015), receiving one music show win for each.\nOn January 15, 2016, DSP Media announced Gyuri, Seungyeon, and Hara's contracts expired and left the company. For Kara's 15th anniversary in 2022, members Gyuri, Seungyeon, Nicole, Jiyoung, and Youngji reunited to release an EP titled Move Again. Its single, \"When I Move,\" earned Kara their first music show win in seven years.On April 3, 2024, Kara announced \"The 5th Japan Tour 2024 Karasia\" would begin in August, 9 years after their last Karasia tour. On June 18, 2024, Kara announced a comeback on July 24 with the special digital single \"I Do I Do\". \"Hello,\" a pre-release single featuring vocals from late member Hara was later released on July 16.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe group's name comes from the Greek word \"chara\" (χαρά, lit. \"joy\"), which they interpreted to mean \"sweet melody\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2007: Early beginnings and debut ===\nThe group started off as a quartet with members Park Gyuri, Han Seung-yeon, Kim Sung-hee, and Jung Nicole. On March 29, 2007, Kara debuted on Mnet's M Countdown with \"Break It\" from their first album The First Blooming. Their debut song displayed a strong female image and R&B sound. Other singles from the same album were titled \"If U Wanna\" and \"Secret World\". Music videos for the first two singles were created. Although their album was acclaimed by critics, it was not well received by the general public and was overshadowed by other girl groups who debuted the same year. All promotions for their first album ended in the summer of 2007. In August 2007, the group came out with a documentary on M.net called Kara Self Camera which showcased the group, their talents, and the relationships they had with each other. The first season debuted on August 8, 2007, and ended on December 12, 2007, with over 15 episodes. In the following months, member Seungyeon continued participating in many television variety shows to keep the group's name recognizable to the public, as their first album was not a commercial success.\nComparisons were often drawn between them and their senior labelmates, Fin.K.L, because of their similarities in style and concept as well as the fact that the two groups were signed to the same label. Additionally, each individual member of Kara was paralleled to a member of Fin.K.L. In response to the comparisons, the members of Kara stated that they regarded the comparisons as beneficial and inspiring.\n\n\n=== 2008: First line-up changes, Rock U, Pretty Girl and career breakthrough ===\nThe group was scheduled to have their comeback in March 2008 with their second album. However, on February 28, DSP announced that Sunghee would be leaving the group and retire of the entertainment industry. She first announced that her departure from the group was due to her parents pressure to focus on her education after she failed all of her college exams. In response, DSP stated that the second album that was recorded would be shelved and replaced by a mini-album to come in May; in addition, two members would join the group. Auditions were held, and the two new members were eventually revealed to be Goo Ha-ra and Kang Jiyoung. The group made their return in the music industry as a quintet on July 24, 2008, with \"Rock U\" on M Countdown. Their first mini-album titled Rock U was released the next day. They made their comeback with the \"cute\" and \"playful\" image which was the complete opposite of the group's original image from their debut.

The full video was released on December 2, 2008, online and was positively received by the public. The EP, Pretty Girl, was released on December 4, embodying a \"fun-party\" concept. The group began promoting their comeback on all major music shows on December 4, 2008, starting with M! Countdown.  During their first national performance on KBS's Music Bank, member Goo Hara accidentally gasped \"ah!\" live on air due to slipping on falling confetti, and reportedly cried profusely afterwards.  The incident became a hot issue to many viewers, but Goo Hara received comfort instead of criticism from the general public.\nPark Gyuri attributed their popularity increase to their \"pretty but natural\" appeal, while media reports gave credit to the band for finally finding its own identity in the music industry since the group's debut and to older male fans, most notably singer Shin Hae Chul.\nDue to their increasingly hectic schedule as their popularity rose, a few of the group's members were taken to the hospital on December 19 after a Music Bank rehearsal for cold symptoms and exhaustion.\n\n\n=== 2009: Rise in popularity in South Korea, Honey and Revolution ===\n\nAt the end of January 2009, DSP announced that it would commence voting on January 28 at the group's official website for the follow-up single to \"Pretty Girl\", which ended on February 2.  By the deadline of February 2, \"Honey\" was the clear winner, with 60% of the votes.  The song was remixed from the original version, and also underwent a slight name change from \"하니\" (Ha-ni) to \"Honey\". The group released the music video for \"Honey\" on February 16 and had their first live broadcasting comeback on KBS's Music Bank program on February 13, 2009; a repackaged mini-album entitled Honey followed on February 19 which featured remixed versions of songs from the group's previous EP. \"Honey\" became the group's first number one single when it topped Gaon's weekly singles chart.

The music video was released on July 29, with the full album, Revolution, available online on July 30.  Comeback activities commenced on July 31, beginning with KBS's Music Bank; the group performed both \"Wanna\" and \"Mister\".  \"Mister\" proved to be popular with netizens due to the \"butt dance\" that is featured prominently in the choreography.

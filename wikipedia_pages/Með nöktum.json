    "text": "Með nöktum (With The Naked) was a short-lived Icelandic new wave band from the 1980s. After the demise of the occult post-punk band Þeyr, their vocalist Magnús Guðmundsson went on to form a group which continued the musical style of Þeyr. They only released one album in 1985 titled Skemmtun and split up just a short time afterwards.\nMusically it follows the path of Þeyr's The Fourth Reich and the \"Lunaire\" single.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo clip of “Emotional Swing” at YouTube.com\nPage about Halldór Lárusson at trommari.is (in Icelandic)"

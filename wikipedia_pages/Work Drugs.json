Band members Tom and Ben bonded together in sailing school over music, which is when they started composing songs for their first album. Their music has been compared with that of Steely Dan by the Guardian website.\nTheir earliest efforts arrived sporadically in the form of singles (\"Third Wave\", \"Dog Daze\" and \"Rad Racer\"). On June 27, 2011 the duo released their first album Summer Blood, which consisted of their first few singles and three acoustic recordings. Later that year they released their sophomore album Aurora Lies. The album, released on November 7, 2011, was the band's first release to bring a collection of entirely previously unreleased tracks. On July 10, 2012, Work Drugs resurfaced with their third album, Absolute Bearing.\nIn August 2011, the song \"Rad Racer\" was featured in the Urban Outfitters commercial for \"Favorite Fall Jeans of 2011\".\nIn his 2011 album, Still Sound, Xxyyxx included a remixed version of \"Rad Racer\".\nWork Drugs have played live shows across North America in cities such as Boston, New York City, Chicago and San Francisco. In April 2011, the group supported Northern Ireland-based indie rock band Two Door Cinema Club and Chicago indie rock band Maps & Atlases on a tour of the West Coast of the United States.\nIn late 2011, Work Drugs supported Peter, Bjorn & John and Memoryhouse on their east coast tour through Philadelphia.\nIn February 2012, Work Drugs supported Umphrey's McGee on their east coast run through Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nLittle Scream â€“ \"The Heron and the Fox\" (Work Drugs Remix) (2011 Secretly Canadian)\nBon Iver - \"Beth/Rest\" (Work Drugs Remix) (2012 Jagjaguwar)\n\n\n== Singles ==\nAs a celebration of their first anniversary, Work Drugs released a collaborative single with Philly artist Dylan Sieh aka Tours called Dirty Dreams on 7 December 2011.\n\nThe track can be streamed here.\n\n\n== Track List: Summer Blood ==\n\nAll tracks can be streamed from here.\n\n\n== Track List: Aurora Lies ==\n\nAll tracks can be streamed from here.\n\n\n== Track List: Cayman Islands Sessions ==\n\nAll tracks can be streamed from here.\n\n\n== Track List: Absolute Bearing ==\n\nAll tracks can be streamed from here.\n\n\n== Track List: Delta ==\n\nAll tracks can be streamed from here.\n\n\n== Track List: Mavericks ==\n\nAll tracks can be streamed from here.\n\n\n== Track List: Insurgents ==\n\nAll tracks can be streamed from here.\n\n\n== Track List: Runaways ==\n\nAll tracks can be streamed from here.\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website"

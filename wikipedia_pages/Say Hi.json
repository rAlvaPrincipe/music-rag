    "text": "Say Hi (previously known as Say Hi to Your Mom) is a Seattle-based indie rock band formed in Brooklyn in 2002 by Eric Elbogen. \nSay Hi's albums are recorded at Elbogen's home, with him playing all of the instruments & providing vocals.\n\n\n== Background information ==\nEric Elbogen was born in 1976 and grew up in San Fernando Valley, California. He attended UCLA.\nHe moved to Brooklyn, New York & created Say Hi to Your Mom in 2002.\nHe plays a Fender Jazzmaster guitar.\n\n\n== History ==\nElbogen most often tours as a solo act, but occasionally employs friends to accompany him as his backing band.\nTheir fourth release, Impeccable Blahs, was written almost entirely about vampires, though Star Trek is also mentioned. The song \"Angels and Darlas\" is a reference to Angel and Darla from the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spinoff Angel both created by Joss Whedon.\nWith the release of their fifth album The Wishes and the Glitch, the band shortened their name to \"Say Hi\". \nThis was done because the earlier name reflected an aesthetic that no longer matched the band's tastes.\nSay Hi covered The Violent Femmes' \"Kiss Off\" for American Laundromat Records' charity album \"Sing Me To Sleep â€“ Indie Lullabies\" in 2010\nElbogen's lyrics are noted as being one of the band's strengths.\n\n\n== In media ==\nSay Hi's song, \"One, Two...One\" from Oohs & Aahs was featured in a 2010 Cadillac CTS sports sedan commercial.\nSay Hi's song, \"November Was White, December was Grey\" from Oohs & Aahs was featured during the credits of the third episode on the Showtime show, \"Shameless\", which aired in January 2011.\nSay Hi's song, \"Hallie and Henry\" from Oohs & Aahs was featured in season 2 episode 8 of United States of Tara, \"Explosive Diorama\".\nTheir song \"Devils\" was featured in the 2011 film, Scream 4.\nThe song \"Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh\" from the 2009 album Oohs & Aahs was featured in a scene featuring Lio Tipton (credited as Analeigh Tipton) from the 2011 movie Crazy, Stupid, Love.\nIt was also played in Gossip Girl Season 2 Episode 23.\n\nSay Hi's song, \"Back Before We Were Brittle\" from The Wishes and the Glitch serves as the theme song for Janet Varney's podcast The JV Club hosted on Nerdist.com.\nAn excerpt from \"Back Before We Were Brittle\" is used as the theme song for the TV show Playing House.\n\nIn 2012, the songs \"Shakes Her Shoulders\", \"Northwestern Girls\", \"Devils\", \"Shiny Diamonds\" & \"Love Love Love\" were all featured in the 2012 movie Free Samples.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nDiscosadness (2002)\nNumbers & Mumbles (2004)\nFerocious Mopes (2005)\nImpeccable Blahs (2006)\nThe Wishes and the Glitch (2008)\nOohs & Aahs (2009)\nUm, Uh Oh (2011)\nEndless Wonder (2014)\nBleeders Digest (2015)\nCaterpillar Centipede (2018)\nDiamonds & Donuts (2020)\nElocution Prattle (2023)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nDevils (2010)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nInterview with Eric at Aural States\nInterview with Eric @ SomethingGlorious.com\nSoundcrank Podcast Hosted by Say Hi To Your Mom\nRIP Say Hi\nInterview with Say Hi at Battle of the Midwestern Housewives\nInterview with Say Hi in Slush Pile Magazine"

The band's most popular records included \"After I Say I'm Sorry,\" \"Dinah,\" \"Gimme a Little Kiss, Will Ya, Huh?\" and \"Lonesome and Sorry.\" According to Rex Stewart, the primitive recording techniques of the day (for example, bass and snare drums could not be recorded) failed to provide a true record of the band.\n\n\n== References =="

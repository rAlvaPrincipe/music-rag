    "text": "Rotterdam Terror Corps, often abbreviated RTC, is a Dutch gabber act formed in 1993. Originally formed by five Dutch DJs (DJ Distortion, MC Raw, DJ Reanimator, DJ Petrov, and DJ Rob), currently there is only one of the original DJs left, DJ Distortion. DJ Petrov and DJ Rob left to pursue individual work. Reanimator (Patrick Moerland) produced the first album and left twice, the second time in 1995 permanently after an argument with DJ Distortion. In 2002 MC Raw was replaced by Cyriel Brandon, better known by his stage name \"RTSier\", for health reasons. RTSier is since that time the MC and live performer on stage. The group has gained a notoriety for its use of eroticism, with each live performance containing female strippers and pyrotechnics. After MC Raw was replaced, he was still able to perform occasionally. \nDJ Distortion (George Ruseler) is the main producer while MC Raw (Ricky Peroti) used to add vocals, RTSier and other mc's like Lex Couper are doing the shows since 2016. \nRotterdam Terror Corps has also worked with many other DJs and producers, including Bass-D, The Headbanger, Neophyte, King Matthew, SRB/Dione and Dr. Macabre.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThree Wasted Souls (Megarave Records, 1995).\nStrictly Hardcore (Megarave Records, 1996).\nSick and Twisted (Megarave Records, 1997).\nFrom Dusk till Doom (Megarave Records, 1998).\n5 Years RTC, The Remix Album (Megarave Records, 1998).\nConstrictor (Megarave Records, 1999).\nFuck the Millennium (Megarave Records, 1999).\nSchizophrenic (Megarave Records, 2000).\nUnleash Hell (Megarave Records, 2002).\nGiftbox (2005)\nGiftbox 2008 (DVD)\nTime To Kill Another One (Megarave Records, 2008)\nI Will Never Surrender (Megarave Records, 2009)\nStrictly Hardcore (Megarave Records, 2010)\nDemonic State (Megarave Records, 2011)\nRespect the Core (Megarave Records 2013)\nDestiny (Megarave Records, 2014)\nNu Metalz (Megarave Records, 2014)\nBefore Dawn (Megarave Records, 2015)\nWe make you feel (Megarave Records, 2015)\nRelease your anger (Megarave Records, 2016)\n\n\n== External links ==\nRotterdam Terror Corps\ndiscogs.com complete Rotterdam Terror Corps discography"

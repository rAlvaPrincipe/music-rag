    "text": "Linus Loves is the alias of Scottish dance music remixer/producer Duncan Reid and, until 2005, a duo consisting of himself and Kevin McKay. Reid and McKay co-founded Breastfed Recordings together in 2002 with Myles MacInnes, known as Mylo. McKay left the outfit in 2005, and Reid has continued using the moniker until the present day.\nThe outfit is best known for their 2003 hit single \"Stand Back\", with vocals by Sam Obernik. It is a cover version of the 1983 Stevie Nicks' song. The track peaked at number 31 on the UK Singles Chart in November 2003.\nReid has since become an in-demand remixer working on songs for various artists including Britney Spears, Kelis, Mika, Jamiroquai and Scissor Sisters.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nStage Invader (2006)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nThe Victoria Principle EP (2005)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Selected remixes ===\nScissor Sisters – \"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\" (2006)\nJamelia – \"Something About You\" (2006)\nJustin Timberlake – \"SexyBack\" (2006)\nGroove Armada featuring Mutya Buena – \"Song 4 Mutya (Out of Control)\" (2007)\nThe Killers – \"Read My Mind\" (2007)\nKelis – \"Lil Star\" (2007)\nMika – \"Grace Kelly\" (2007)\nYoko Ono – \"No, No, No\" (2008)\nAlphabeat – \"Fascination\" (2008)\nLadyhawke – \"Dusk Till Dawn\" (2008)\nBritney Spears – \"Circus\" (2009)\nPixie Lott – \"Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)\" (2009)\nJamiroquai – \"Blue Skies\" (2010)\nBritney Spears – \"Hold It Against Me\" (2011)\nTheophilus London – \"Wine and Chocolates\" (2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nDiscogs.com"

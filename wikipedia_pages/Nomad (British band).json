    "text": "Nomad was a house music duo from the United Kingdom who had several hits on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart as well as successes on the UK Singles Chart. Group members were Damon Rochefort (Nomad is Damon spelled backwards, thus the group's name), Steve McCutcheon and Sharon D. Clarke.\nIn 1991, they hit number 1 on the US Dance chart and number 2 in the UK with the song \"(I Wanna Give You) Devotion\", billed as Nomad featuring MC Mikee Freedom. Their follow-up single, \"Just a Groove\", reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart.\nAnother single was \"Something Special\", also from the album Changing Cabins. Then followed \"Your Love Is Lifting Me\" and \"24 Hours a Day\". A second album, titled Different Drum, was discussed, but it never materialised.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Album ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one dance hits (United States)\nList of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chart\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNomad discography at Discogs"

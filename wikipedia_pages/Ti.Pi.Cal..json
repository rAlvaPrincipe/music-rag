Their major hits were the songs \"Round and Round\" and \"The Colour Inside\", which both ranked number one on the Italian singles hit parade, respectively in February and between July and August 1995. In 1996, the members of the group started a side project called Kasto.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1996 - Colourful (EMI)\n2011 - Stars (Universal)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTi.Pi.Cal. at AllMusic\nTi.Pi.Cal. discography at Discogs"

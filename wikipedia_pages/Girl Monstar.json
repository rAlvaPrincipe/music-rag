Both of their singles, \"Surfing on a Wave of Love\" / \"He's Hell\" (1989) and \"Joe Cool\" (1990), topped the Australian Independent charts. They issued one album, Monstereo Delicio, in July 1992 on Timberyard Records. Child was replaced by Janene Abbott but the group disbanded in 1993. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described their sound \"trash pop style mixed tough guitar riffs with strong harmonies\". Valier as Rich, is a country rock artist and has issued solo material as well as performing in bands. McCue is also an alternative country artist, she relocated to Nashville and has released several solo albums.\n\n\n== History ==\nGirl Monstar formed in 1988 in Melbourne with the line-up of Damian Child (Feline Touch) on bass guitar and vocals; Anne McCue (Vertigo) on lead guitar, slide guitar and vocals; Sherry Valier (aka Sherry Rich)(Obscure Alternatives, Cactus Fever) on lead vocals, harmonica and rhythm guitar; and Ritchie Hine on drums. After a few months Hine left the band to join the newly formed Screaming Tribesmen and was replaced by Sue World (Wet Ones). The group signed with Timberyard Records and in October 1989 issued their debut double-A-sided single, \"Surfing on a Wave of Love\" / \"He's Hell\". Both tracks are written by Valier.\nEarly in 1990 Girl Monstar supported the Australian leg of a tour by Danish hard rock group, D. A. D., which was followed by a similar support for United States heavy metal band, Skid Row. Later that year they issued a second single, \"Joe Cool\", which is also written by Valier.\nBoth of their singles, \"Surfing on a Wave of Love\" / \"He's Hell\" and \"Joe Cool\", topped the Australian Independent charts. The single \"Joe Cool\", was produced by Kevin 'Cavemen' Shirley. The band provided a support show for The Buzzcocks and then The Ramones.\nIn July 1992 Girl Monstar released their debut album, Monstereo Delicio, which was produced by Paul Kosky (Not Drowning, Waving) and Jedd Starr.

    "text": "Blectum from Blechdom is an electronic music duo, formed in 1998 by Kristin Erickson (Kevin Blechdom) and Bevin Kelley (Blevin Blectum). Erickson and Kelley met at Mills College in Oakland, California. They initially performed locally, in the San Francisco Bay Area and recorded their first EP, titled Snauses and Mallards, in March 2000, followed by their first full-length album The Messy Jesse Fiesta (that won second prize for Digital Musics at Ars Electronica in 2001) later that year. Both artists retain their pen names when working on solo projects.\nTheir music has been described as exceptionally irreverent and humorous and though experimental in nature, with heavy glitch influences, never pretentious and always rhythmic. \n\n\n== Discography ==\nSnauses and Mallards (2000)\nThe Messy Jesse Fiesta (2000)\nBad Music and Buttprints (2000)\nDe Snaunted Haus (2000)\nHaus de Snaus (2001)\nFishin' In Front Of People: The Early Years 1998-2000 (2002)\nDeepBone (2021)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Zontanoi Nekroi (\"Living Dead\") is a Greek rap group formed in 1997. The members are Taki Tsan, Midenistis, Katahthonios, Ypohthonios, and Harmanis.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nAt a concert of the hip hop group Terror X Crew in 1997 at the Camel Clubâ€“Athens, a police raid took place and almost everybody in the concert (even the band) were taken to the police station of Piraeus. Terror X Crew's DJ ALX's brother, Panagiotis Stravalexis and rapper Panos Bougas met there, and decided to form a hip hop group. The two of them first started as the Gate of the Living Dead. Stravalexis took the pseudonym Timvorihos - Grave Robber (under alias; Taki Tsan) and Bougas took the name Midenistis - Nihilist. Eventually they changed the band's name to Zontanoi Nekroi along with recruiting rappers for the group. Ipohthonios, Katahthonios and Harmanis are the aliases of the three new members who completed the group.\n\n\n== Albums ==\nThey released the EP ZN Entoles in early 1998, and later that year was their only album O Protos Tomos. Following the release of Protos Tomos, most members of the group went to pursue solo careers. Stravalexis changed his alias to Pedi Thavma and released an LP called Rima gia Hrima in 1999. In 2000, ZN started recording Kata.R.Ipo, a duet album by Ipohthonios and Katahthonios, but never released it.\nIn 2001, they were working on Harmanis' debut solo named Sisihaha which was never released too. Having collected several unreleased songs, they released a compilation album named Thammena Ksehasmena which contained songs from Kata.R.Ipo, a song that did not fit in Rima gia Hrima, the first track that was recorded for Megalos Iroas, Midenistis' first solo album, and some alternate editions of old songs. The group informally disbanded after the release of Midenistis LP Megalos Iroas in 2002. \nIn 2008, they formed up again and gave some concerts. During one of their concerts, they announced that they are working on Defteros Tomos. ZN continued to work together as they recorded some songs for Taki Tsan's 2009 LP \"Rima gia Hrima 2\". Although Defteros Tomos was supposed to be released in 2010, it has yet to be seen. Due to this, it is widely rumored that the group has disbanded, and they all returned to their solo careers after their supposed hiatus Midenistis and Ipohthonios went mainstream. In September 2014, though after Taki Tsan publicly called out the other members and after their acceptance, they are expected to record Defteros Tomos.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nZN Entoles/Sti Hora Ton Kaliteron MCs, EP, FM Records/Ihokratoria (1998)\nO Protos Tomos, LP, FM Records/Ihokratoria (1998)\nThamena Ksehasmena, Compilation, FM Records/Ihokratoria (2001)\nThe Rare And Unreleased Songs, Mixtape, Gus Productions (2009)\nThe Rare And Unreleased Songs Vol. 2, Mixtape, Gus Productions (2009)\nPasa Doumania/Paresthisis, EP, Ihokratoria (2015)\n\n\n== Solo discography ==\nStin Athina, CD Single, FM Records/Ihokratoria (1999) by Taki Tsan (as Pedi Thavma)\nRima Gia Hrima, LP, FM Records/Ihokratoria (1999) by Taki Tsan (as Pedi Thavma)\nMegalos Iroas, LP, FM Records/Ihokratoria (2002) by Midenistis\nStihi San Fotia, CD, FM Records (2004) by Midenistis\nSiatista, Mixtape, No Label (2004) by Ipohthonios\nMixtape Vol.0, Mixtape, hiphop.gr (2005) by Taki Tsan\nMixtape Vol.1, Mixtape, newstyle.gr (2005) by Taki Tsan\nMixtape Vol.2: Misa Lefta/Dipli Maggia, Mixtape, IhoSpira (2005) by Taki Tsan\nTo Pedi Tou Dromou, Mixtape, No label (2005) by Ipohthonios\nSto Mialo Tou Panagioti Stravaleksi, LP, IhoSpira/FM Records (2006) by Taki Tsan\nKane Ntou, Single, Minos EMI (2007) by Ipohthonios\nPion Akous, CD, Minos EMI (2008) by Ipohthonios\nTo Kalitero Deal, Single, Minos EMI (2008) by Katahthonios\nKommaTia Laska, Mixtape, No label (2008) by Harmanis\n50/50, CD, Minos EMI (2008) by Midenistis\nIn' O Man, CD, Sporty Magazine (2009) by Taki Tsan\nKommatia Harma, Mixtape, No Label (2009) by Harmanis\nUno, Single, No Label (2009) by Ipohthonios\nRima gia Hrima 2, 2 CD's, Ihokratoria/RAP Monster (2009) by Taki Tsan\nVromiko, Mixtape, No Label (2010) by Ipohthonios\nExclusive Mixtape, Mixtape, takitsan.com (2011) by Taki Tsan\nAthens' Finest, Mixtape, takitsan.com (2011) by Taki Tsan\nTo Mialo Mou Girnaei, Single, Spicy Records (2011) by Ipohthonios\nMia Zografia, Single, Panik Records (2011) by Midenistis with Demy\nVrehi Fragga, Mixtape, Capital Music (2012) by Ipohthonios\nTo Party Den Stamata, Single, Panik Records (2012) by Midenistis with Eleni Foureira\nZo Ti Stigmi, Single, Panik Records (2012) by Midenistis\nKala Koritsia, Single, Panik Records (2012) by Midenistis\nSe Ena Tiho, Single, Panik Records (2012) by Midenistis with Michalis Hadjiyiannis\nProdotis, Single, Capital Music (2013) by Ipohthonios\nOli Mazi, Single, Panik Records (2013) by Midenistis\nS Agapao, Single, Panik Records (2013) by Midenistis with Tamta\nEtos 2013, Single, Panik Records (2013) by Midenistis\nTo Sistima, EP, Ihokratoria/33 1/3 Entertainment (2014) by Taki Tsan\nSe Ena Aggelo Milo, Single, Panik Records (2014) by Midenistis with Yiannis Vardis\nPanik Boys, Single, Panik Records (2014) by Midenistis with Snik\nTa Kalitera, Single, Panik Records (2014) by Midenistis with Kostas Martakis\nColombiano, Single, Capital Music (2015) by Ipohthonios\nPacman, Single, Capital Music (2015) by Ipohthonios\nTo Poto, Single, Panik Records (2015) by Midenistis\nZoo, Single, Panik Records (2015) by Midenistis\nMaradona, Single, Capital Music (2016) by Ipohthonios\nOla Auta Pou Tha Thela, Single, No Label (2016) by Midenistis\nEho / Ta Sporia Mas, Single, No Label (2016) by Midenistis\nAllos Enas, Single, Athens Mob Records (2016) by Taki Tsan with Rack\nIpopta, Single, Athens Mob Records (2016) by Taki Tsan\nTzogadoros, Single, Athens Mob Records (2016) by Taki Tsan\nAllazo Styl, Single, Athens Mob Records (2017) by Taki Tsan\nDemos 4 Memos, Mixtape, Athens Mob Records (2017) by Taki Tsan (as DJ Westley)\nPeru, Single, Capital Music (2017) by Ipohthonios\nEleni Vitali, Single, Capital Music (2017) by Ipohthonios\nLogia Alithina, Single, Athens Mob Records (2017) by Taki Tsan\n\n\n== Other projects ==\nTheoria Kai Praxi, LP, FM Records/Ihokratoria (2003) by Tigre Sporakia (Taki Tsan & Isvoleas)\nTo Sholio, LP, FM Records/Ihokratoria (2004) by Harmanis & Taki Tsan\nSta Paidia, Single, No Label (2009) by Taki Tsan & Diezel\nHigh Oso Den Paei, Single, Polla Kila Entertainment (2010) by Harmanis & Billy Sio with Taki Tsan\nTo Styl Mou, Single, Polla Kila Entertainment (2011) by Harmanis & Billy Sio\nOnoma Kai Pragma, LP, No Label (2011) by Tigre Sporakia (Taki Tsan & Isvoleas)\nTrilogia, EP, Capital Music (2013) by Ipohthonios & Skive\nThelei Na Dineis Tin Psihi Sou Gi Auto, Single, Ihokratoria (2013) by Taki Tsan & Kebzer\nAlli Fasi, Single, Ihokratoria (2013) by Taki Tsan & Kebzer\nDen Einai Anagki, Single, Ihokratoria (2014) by Taki Tsan & Kanon\nSkame Sta Mavra, Single, RNS Records (2016) by Taki Tsan & Thitis\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Homepage of ZN\n[1]"

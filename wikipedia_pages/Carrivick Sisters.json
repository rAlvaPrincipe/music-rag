    "text": "The Carrivick Sisters are twins Laura and Charlotte Carrivick from South Devon, England, who perform as a musical duo. They combine original songs, based on old stories, legends and folklore from their local area, with American bluegrass and old-time music.\nThe Carrivick Sisters have been performing as a duo since 2006 and turned professional in 2007. They were finalists for the BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Award in 2010.\nTheir 2013 album Over the Edge featured Blair Dunlop on harmony vocals and, like their previous album From the Fields, was produced by Josh Rusby (brother of folk singer Kate Rusby).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

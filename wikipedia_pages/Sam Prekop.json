He studied at the Kansas City Art Institute.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Shrimp Boat ===\nBack in Chicago, Prekop formed the band Shrimp Boat, which was active from 1988 to 1993.\n\n\n=== The Sea and Cake ===\nAfter Shrimp Boat dissolved in 1993, Sam Prekop and Eric Claridge formed The Sea and Cake, and recruited Archer Prewitt and John McEntire.\n\n\n=== Solo career ===\nPrekop enlisted the help of Jim O'Rourke (X-Factor) to produce his self-titled first solo album in 1999. Bassist Josh Abrams, drummer Chad Taylor, and guitarist Archer Prewitt also contributed their talents. The album was described as soft and breezy, with tinges of Brazilian pop. In April that year Prekop performed with Aerial M in Toronto.\nIn 2005, Who's Your New Professor featured drummer Chad Taylor and cornetist Rob Mazurek (both from the Chicago Underground Duo), bassist Josh Abrams (Sticks & Stones), and The Sea and Cake bandmates Archer Prewitt and John McEntire on guitar and drums, respectively.\nOld Punch Card primarily featured modular synthesizer.\nReleased in 2015, The Republic further explored the emotional possibilities of the modular synthesizer.

    "text": "Tide Lines are a four-piece folk pop band from the Highlands of Scotland. Cited in 2023 as one of the leading folk rock groups in Scotland, their musical style has been described as \"anthemic, indie-folk\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band's first studio album Dreams We Never Lost was released in June 2017 following the release of their first single Far Side Of The World some months earlier. The album is a mix of English and Gaelic songs as well as the Piob Mhor Pipe set. Two further singles Fortunes of the Fearless and The Young and The Restless were also released as singles from this album.\nIn October 2018 the band released a six track EP entitled Lets Make Tonight. Two singles, Heroes and Running at the Dark were released prior to the EP. Heroes won Video of the Year at the 2018 Na Trad Awards. The EP also contained a live version of Far Side of the World recorded at the HebCelt Music Festival in 2018. In November, the band sold out the Scottish music venue Barrowlands in Glasgow.\nTheir second album, Eye of the Storm, was released in May 2020 and debuted at #12 in the Official UK Album Charts. Eye of the Storm also topped both the Scottish and independent album charts on the week of its release.\nIn December 2020, the band issued a small scale release through their own website called the Lockdown Mix Tape consisting of three cover songs and the song This Christmas Time which was re-released as a single in 2022 as a duet with musician NatiDreddd.\nRivers in the Light was released in July 2022 as new material from the planned third studio album, again self-produced and recorded at the group's own studio. Written in the Scars was released in September 2022.\nIn March 2023, the band released their third studio album An Ocean Full of Islands and announced a tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\n\n== Members ==\nRobert Robertson – vocals and guitar\nAlasdair Turner – electric guitar and bagpipes\nRoss Wilson – keyboard\nFergus Munro – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\n\"Dreams We Never Lost\" (2017)\n\"Eye of the Storm\" (2020)\n\"An Ocean Full of Islands\" (2023)\nEPs\n\n\"Let's Make Tonight - EP\" (2018)\n\"Lockdown Mixtape - EP\" (2020)\nSingles and songs\n\n\"Far Side of the World\" (2016)\n\"The Young and the Restless\" (2017)\n\"Fortunes of the Fearless\" (2017)\n\"Streets of Dreamers\" (2018)\n\"Let's Make Tonight\" (2018)\n\"Running at the Dark\" (2019)\n\"Heroes\" (2019)\n\"Shadow to the Light\" (2020)\n\"Innocent and Beautiful\" (2020)\n\"Eye of the Storm\" (2021)\n\"Rivers in the Light\" (2022)\n\"Written in the Scars\" (2022)\n\"These Days\" (2023)\n\"Hardly Surprising\" (2023)\n\"Homeward Bound\" (2024)\n\"Cherry Blossom Sunset\" (2024)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

    "text": "Pala Velho was a \"tchê music\" band (a modern version of traditional folkloric Brazilian gaucho music) from Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.\nThe band started out in the mid 1990s and became very popular throughout Rio Grande do Sul competing with bands in the same genre such as Tchê Barbaridade. The band briefly became successful nationally and appeared on national television. To broaden their appeal, they reworked their music to be more pop-oriented and not have as much of a gaucho sound from instruments such as the accordion. The band also changed their style by wearing normal street clothing on their album covers instead of traditional gaucho garb. The band continued to exist in the early 2000s with some new members and the original lead singer/song writer, but soon disbanded in the middle of the decade.\nThe band recorded under the ACIT label and later the USA Discos label, but despite their past popularity are no longer mentioned on either labels' web site.\nThey also participated in other works, among them the CD \"Tchê Music - Live\" in 1999, a merger of Acit with Abril and also the DVD \"Festa Gaúcha\" in 2003 by USA Discos, their first and only appearance on a DVD.\nMain successes:\n- Buenas Tchê (1996)\n- Vanera do Coração (1996)\n- Louco Pra Ti Ver (1996)\n- Sou Rio Grande (1998)\n- Gaúcho Eu Sou (1998)\n- Primeiro Amor (1998)\n- Orgulho de Gaúcho (1998)\n- Apenas Uma Madrugada (2000)\n- Morena (2000)\n- Dançando a Vanera (2000)\n- Na Batida da Vanera (2003)\n- O Bicho Vai Pegar (2003)\n- Eu Te Amo (2003)\n- Cara a Cara (2006)\n- Por Nada (2006)\n- Pior é Te Perder (2006)\nOriginal band members:\n\nMarcelo Dametto (lead singer, main song writer)\nMarquinhos (guitar and vocals)\nJuninho (drums)\nCristiano Basso (bass, vocals)\nJoelson Godinho (accordion)\nFormer Members:\n\nWagner Gehlen (accordion)\nLuciano Gradaschi (guitar and vocals)\nFrederico Tisot (harmonica, guitar and percussion)\nBernardo Tisot (drums)\nSelected discography:\n\nBuenas Tchê (1996) - Acit\nSou Rio Grande (1998) - Acit\nDançando a Vanera (2000) - Acit\nOs 16 Grandes Sucessos do Grupo Pala Velho (2003) - Acit\nNa Batida da Vanera (2003) - USA Discs\nCara a Cara (2006) - Independente\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Portuguese) Pala Velho playing \"Primeiro Amor\" in concert\n\n\n== References =="

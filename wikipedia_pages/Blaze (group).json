    "text": "Blaze is an American house music group formed in New Jersey in 1984.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was formed by Josh Milan, Kevin Hedge and Chris Herbert, when Herbert introduced Milan, a member of his church choir, to Hedge, his childhood friend. Herbert was the one who left the group in 1991, leaving Milan and Hedge to carry on working together.\nThe group's output consists mainly of house music songs. When the group started, Herbert was the singer, with Milan playing the piano, and Hedge on production. After Herbert left, both Hedge and Milan started to share production duties, vocals, and playing most of the instruments of the group's tracks and albums. The group achieved notoriety with its remix of Lisa Stansfield's \"People Hold On\" in 1989, after signing with Motown/MCA Records.\nBlaze released their debut album, 25 Years Later in 1990, after which Herbert decided to move to a more R&B-oriented career, while the two remaining members invested in the emerging club culture, opening a nightclub called Shelter. In 1994, the group scored its first big international production success with De'Lacy's \"Hideaway\", which was later remixed by Deep Dish.\nSince then, Blaze released three more albums, alongside a few scattered compilations of earlier productions and works and countless singles. They also began working with other well-known names such as \"Little\" Louie Vega, Barbara Tucker, Jody Watley and Full Intention. The group are best known to modern audiences by its singles featuring Palmer Brown on vocals, the oft-remixed \"My Beat\", and the tribute anthem \"I Remember House\". Blaze's most recent album, released in 2005, is a mix compilation titled Found Love.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1990 25 Years Later\n1994 6 Hubert St.\n1997 Basic Blaze\n1999 Productions\n1999 The Many Colours of Blaze\n1999 Pure Blaze\n2001 Pure Blaze 2\n2001 Natural Blaze (as James Toney Jr. Project)\n2002 Best of Blaze\n2002 Spiritually Speaking\n2004 The Instrumentals Project\n2004 Keep Hope Alive (as Underground Dance Artists United for Life)\n2004 Spiritually Speaking – Then and Now\n2007 The Best of Blaze Vol 1.

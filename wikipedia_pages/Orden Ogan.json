    "text": "Orden Ogan is a German power metal band with folk metal elements. The band was formed in 1996 by Sebastian Gr√ºtling (drums) and Sebastian Levermann (lead vocals and guitar). They currently have three demos and seven studio albums and are currently signed with Reigning Phoenix Music. Prior to 2024, the band was signed with AFM Records.\nThey are also the organizers of the German metal festival WinterNachtsTraum, which has featured such bands as Rage, Sinister, Axxis, Ensiferum, Van Canto, and Agathodaimon.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in June 1996 as Tanzende Aingewaide, the band was renamed Orden Ogan in 1997. Orden Ogan means \"The Order of Fear,\" Orden being the German word for Order, and Ogan being the Old Celtic word for Fear.  They released three demo tapes: Into Oblivion (1998), Soli Deo Gloria (1999), and Testimonium A.D. (2004).\nThe band considers its history to begin in 2008 with the release of their first studio album, Vale, which was released via Yonah Records in Germany, and met with acclaim by the European press. The German magazine, Rock Hard Magazine, called the band \"the one and only legitimate Blind Guardian successor\". Vale was later released in Brazil and Japan in 2009. Vale is also the first of the band's albums to feature their mascot Alister Vale. The cover art on all of the band's studio albums are done by Andreas Marschall, who has also done cover art for bands such as Blind Guardian. The band's songs may also include deeper meaning, but all studio albums include the loose concept of the story of their mascot Alister Vale, an immortal who is cursed and has to move on and on, but everything he leaves decays behind him. Orden Ogan participated in over 50 shows in 2008, with festivals such as Rock am Ring (Ger, Hi8 stage), Metal Healing in Greece, Germany's Rock Harz, and the Metal Camp in Slovenia.\nIn 2010, Orden Ogan released their second studio album, Easton Hope, with their current label AFM Records. Following the release, Orden Ogan did their first European tour supporting Tiamat.\nFollowing a lineup change in 2011, Orden Ogan returned in 2012 album with their third studio album, To The End, which peaked at #41 on the German charts. The album's first single, The Things we Believe in, has reached over 5.8 million YouTube views as of 2021.\nIn 2013, it was announced that the band would play in the United States for the first time in 2014, participating in the power-progressive music festival, ProgPower USA XV. The band was also included in Wacken Open Air, Made of Metal Festival in the Czech Republic, and went on tour with Rhapsody and Freedom Call. They also toured Europe in January/February 2015 with Hammerfall and Serious Black.\nIn 2014, Orden Ogan frontman, Sebastian \"Seeb\" Levermann founded Greenman Studio, where he now mixes the audio for Orden Ogan. Greenman Studio has also mixed for the band Rhapsody of Fire.\nIn 2015, Orden Ogan released their fourth studio album, Ravenhead, which peaked at #16 on the German charts and #56 on the Swiss charts.\nOrden Ogan released their fifth studio album, Gunmen, on 7 July 2017. On 19 May 2017, Orden Ogan posted the music video for their fifth album's first single, Gunman, to YouTube.\nThe band confirmed on 16 October 2019 that they had hired Steven Wussow (ex-Xandria) as the new bass player.\nThe band's sixth studio album Final Days, was announced on 6 December 2019 and was originally set to be released on 28 August 2020, but was later postponed to 12 March 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first single off of the album, \"In the Dawn of the AI\", was released on 24 July 2020 along with a music video. The second single, \"Heart of the Android\", was released on 4 December 2020. The album was released in March, reaching number 3 on the German charts.\nOn 21 October 2022, the band released their seventh studio album Final Days (Orden Ogan and Friends). The album is a tribute to their previous album Final Days and features the same songs, but with guest vocalists from other bands. In addition to these songs, the album also features the song December, which was originally intended to be released with the original Final Days album. The subject matter for December regarded a killer virus that kills most of humanity, but was deemed to be too sensitive to include during the original release of Final Days due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and was therefore omitted from the original album out of respect for those affected. The new song was also released with a YouTube music video on AFM Records' YouTube channel.\nIn Orden Ogan's 2023 Spotify Wrapped Artist Message, Levermann announced to followers that a new album titled \"The Order of Fear\" would be released in 2024. On February 16, 2024, Reigning Phoenix Records announced the band's eighth studio album \"The Order of Fear\", to be released Summer 2024. Along with the announcement came the announcement of the first single of the album, \"My Worst Enemy\".\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nVale (2008)\nEaston Hope (2010)\nTo the End (2012)\nRavenhead (2015)\nThe Book of Ogan (2016)\nGunmen (2017)\nFinal Days (2021)\nFinal Days (Orden Ogan and Friends) (2022)\nThe Order of Fear (2024)\n\n\n=== Singles / Music videos ===\n\"We Are Pirates!\" (2010)\n\"The Things We Believe In\" (2012)\n\"Land of the Dead\" (2012)\n\"Fever\" (2014)\n\"Gunman\" (2017)\n\"Come with Me to the Other Side\" (2017)\n\"Fields of Sorrow\" (2017)\n\"In the Dawn of the AI\" (2020)\n\"Heart of the Android\" (2020)\n\"Inferno\" (2021)\n\"It Is Over\" (2022)\n\"Absolution For Our Final Days\" (2022)\n\"Inferno\" (2022)\n\"Interstellar\" (2022)\n\"December\" (2022)\n\"My Worst Enemy\" (2024)\n\"The Order of Fear\" (2024)\n\"Conquest\" (2024)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nOrden Ogan at AllMusic \nWinterNachtsTraum Festival\nMetalholic interview"

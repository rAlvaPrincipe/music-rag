    "text": "Waves under Water is a Swedish darkwave/synthpop band formed in October 2007 by the singer Angelica Segerbäck and the composer Johan Svärdshammar. The band has a romantic image which flirts with goth, steampunk and new romantic.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe band recorded their first two songs \"Winter Garden\" and \"My Cup\" in 2007 on the first day, under the temporary name Hopscotch. Soon they changed their name to Waves under Water and in May 2008 they released their first demo titled Winter Garden. Their debut album Serpents and the Tree was released in October 2009 on their own label Calorique Records together with Danse Macabre. The album entered at number 8 in the Deutsche Alternative Charts. The main theme of the album is Norse pagan myths and the drama between winter and summer, and the album title refers to the tree Yggdrasil.\nApart from the founders Angelica Segerbäck and Johan Svärdshammar, there is also one live member,  Ursula Ewrelius on synth. On stage, the band uses different kinds of instruments like synths, guitars, cello, glockenspiel and a bass played with a sickle.\nSegerbäck and Svärdshammar also have the side project LinaLaukaR.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nAngelica Segerbäck, (Vocals, Lyrics, Music, Glockenspiel, Cello)\nJohan Svärdshammar, (Music, Lyrics, Backing Vocals, Synth, Bass played with sickle, Guitar)\n\n\n=== Live Band members ===\nUrsula Ewrelius, (Synth, Bass guitar) Live member from 2009\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nWinter Garden – (Demo) 2008\nA Short Presentation of – (Demo) 2009\nSerpents and the Tree – (CD Album) 2009 – Calorique Records, Danse Macabre\nAll of Your Light – (CD Album) 2011 – Danse Macabre\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nWinter Garden – (digital) 2009\nRed Red Star – (digital) 2010\nTomorrow – (digital) 2011\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nDark Alliance vol. 3 – (CD) 2009, Track No. 1 \"Serpents and the Tree\" – Danse Macabre\nNew Signs & Sounds 11/09 – (CD) 2009, Track No. 2 \"Serpents and the Tree\" – Zillo\nSonic Seducer Cold Hands Seduction Vol. 100 (CD) 2009, Track No. 7 \"Winter Garden\" – Sonic Seducer\nGothic Lifestyle 3 (CD) Nov 2009, Track No. 13 \"Serpents and the Tree\" – Gothic Magazine\nEXTREME traumfänger 10 (CD) Dec 2009, Track No. 9 \"Nothing More\" – UpScene\nDie Zillo-CD 05/2010 (CD) Apr 2010, Track No. 15 \"Red Red Star\" – Zillo\nDark Alliance vol. 7 – (CD) 2010, Track No. 8 \"Red Red Star\" – Danse Macabre\nVA-Zillo New Signs & Sounds 02 – 2011 (CD) Feb 2011, Track No. 5 \"Tomorrow\" – Zillo\nGothic Compilation 50 (2CD) Feb 2011, CD2 Track No. 15 – Gothic\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Myspace\nDanse Macabre's Waves under Water page\nWaves under Water discography at Discogs"

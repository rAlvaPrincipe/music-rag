    "text": "Kero Kero Bonito (KKB) are a British indie pop band formed in London in 2013. The band consists of vocalist Sarah Midori Perry and producers and multi-instrumentalists Gus Lobban and Jamie Bulled.\nTheir musical style consists of indie pop, electropop, dance-rock, hyperpop, and bubblegum pop. The band's earlier work was influenced by J-pop such as Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, as well as dancehall, and video game music; however, following their 2018 EP TOTEP their sound and influences diversified, with their second studio album, Time 'n' Place, being influenced by indie rock contemporaries such as Mount Eerie and My Bloody Valentine. Perry, who is of mixed Japanese and British ancestry, sings and raps in both Japanese and English.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLobban and Bulled grew up in Bromley in the suburbs south of London and met in their teens. In search for a new band member, they posted advertisements, including on MixB, an online bulletin board for Japanese expatriates, largely due to their interest in \"Japanese rap\". Perry was one of the first respondents. They selected her based on her background in art, and their interest in her bilingual ability. Although she had collaborated with a Japanese girl group previously, Perry did not have a background in professional singing; instead, she was interested in collaborating with Lobban and Bulled simply because she \"wanted to try it\".\nThe trio called themselves Kero Kero Bonito; its meaning is intentionally ambiguous, with one derivation from the Japanese onomatopoeic words for frog croaks and a type of fish. Other meanings include the Brazilian quero-quero bird while \"bonito\" means \"pretty\" in both Portuguese and Spanish, thus \"Pretty Quero-quero\" – or even \"I want, I want pretty\" in a rough translation.\nThe group released their debut mixtape Intro Bonito through Double Denim Records in August 2014. They wrote many of their songs featured on the mixtape using a Casio SA-46 mini-keyboard. The band contributed \"Flamingo\" to Ryan Hemsworth's compilation EP shh#ffb6c1.\nIn September 2014, Kero Kero Bonito released Bonito Recycling, a compilation of Intro Bonito remixes by artists including Danny L Harle and Spazzkid. The band released the single \"Build It Up\", on which Perry sings in a call and response pattern, in November 2014.\nOn 10 August 2015, Kero Kero Bonito announced their first North American tour, which took place during October 2015.\nOn 21 October 2016, the group released their first album Bonito Generation through Double Denim.\nOn 2 February 2017, the YouTuber Berd published a parody animation of the band's single \"Flamingo\". The video went viral, and became an internet meme, surpassing 25 million views as of April 2023.\nOn 12 February 2018, the band released the single \"Only Acting\". It departs from the band's previous electronic sound with a darker, rock-influenced style. Later, on 20 February 2018, the band released the EP TOTEP. The EP included \"Only Acting\", and other songs following the rock-influenced style.\n\nOn 13 April 2018, the band performed their first 'full band' show. This involved two extra members, James Rowland on electric guitar and Jennifer Walton on drums and sampler, as well as Lobban on drums and keyboards and Bulled on bass guitar. Rowland previously played guitar on TOTEP. This change in live line-up reflected their change in sound following the EP.\nOn 8 May 2018, the band released the single, \"Time Today\", and announced their second studio album, Time 'n' Place, which was released on 1 October 2018. The album was sonically a significant departure from their previous studio album, and was inspired by radical changes in the band's personal lives following their tour cycle for their debut album.\nOn 8 July 2019, the band uploaded \"KKB Life\" to YouTube, a vlog video recorded during the Time `n` Place era, announcing that a new era is starting. They announced a North America and Europe tour shortly after and released the single \"When the Fires Come\" in September 2019. Later on in the month, before the tour started, they also released their fourth EP Civilisation I.\nIn 2020, the band wrote and performed \"It's Bugsnax!\", the theme song for the video game Bugsnax, which was featured in its announcement trailer.\nIn April 2021, Kero Kero Bonito released their fifth EP, Civilisation II.\nIn September 2021, Kero Kero Bonito released \"Rom Com 2021\", a remix of Soccer Mommy's single \"Rom Com 2004\". The song was released under the 23rd instalment of Adult Swim's Singles Series.\nIn August 2023, the band released \"Legendary\", the official theme song for the Pokémon World Championships.\n\n\n== Band members and solo work ==\n\n\n=== Sarah Midori Perry ===\nSarah Midori Perry, also known as Sarah Bonito and Cryalot, is the lead singer of the band. On 30 June 2022, Perry released \"Hell Is Here\", her debut single under her solo project Cryalot and the lead single to her debut solo EP Icarus, which was released on 2 September 2022.\nIn addition to her solo work she has featured on many other projects. Electronic musician Spazzkid was a fan of Kero Kero Bonito and enlisted Perry to rap on \"Truly\" from his 2014 Promise EP. In 2014 she was also featured on the track \"Horsey\" by Macross 82-99.  In 2015 she was featured on \"Everyday\", the debut single by producer Chroma-kei. In 2021 she featured on A. G.

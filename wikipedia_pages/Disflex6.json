    "text": "Disflex6 is an American hip hop duo formed in 1996, consisting of Lazerus Jackson and Jason the Argonaut. The group was a notable pioneer in the \"multiracial world of the San Francisco underground hip hop scene.\" The group's unique dark, mellow, avant-garde style of hip-hop garnered international appeal in particular, and they built on that through releases on European-based labels.\n\n\n== History ==\nDisflex6 was scheduled to release a space-themed, concept album Robot Dreams but the deal with Lex Records fell through and they were left looking for a new home. The duo released Slow Burn on Twenty Four Seven Records in 2007, and The Loopholes Project on Sunset leagues International in 2008.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJason the Argonaut - rapper/producer\nLazerus Jackson - rapper\nElon is - producer/engineer\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1984 (1996)\nRoadside Attractions (1998)\nWhere the Sidewalk Ends (2000)\nRobot Dreams (2005)\nSlow Burn (2007)\nThe Loophole Project (2008)\nOdyssey (2013)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nThe Guts EP (2000)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Natural Selection\" (2000)\n\"Hot Season\" (2001)\n\"The Cliffs\" (2001)\n\"Trunk\" (2003)\n\"Dream Sequence\" b/w \"Bomb the Factory\" (2005)\n\"Winnie Cooper\" (2013)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nCollosus - \"You a Grown Man Now (Disflex 6 Remix)\" from From the Lab (2006)\nExtra Kool - \"I Fly\" (Elon & Argonaut Remix) (2012)\nGrandKillaCon - \"Driftin Drifter\" (Argonaut Remix) (2013)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nDisflex6 discography at Discogs"

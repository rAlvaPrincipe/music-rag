Inspired by the atmospheric sounds of bands like Rammstein, Depeche Mode and Deathstars, Rublood created their ownunique mix and a new method to conceive dark and poetic music. One of the bandâ€™s strengths, on the live scene, are the choreographies created by their dancers, the Rubladies, who delight the audience with their magnificent gothic spectacle.

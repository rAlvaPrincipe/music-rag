BeFour's first big appearance was at The Dome 43 in Hamburg on 31 August 2007. As part of the RTL program The Ultimate Chartshow, the band was awarded the Golden Record for \"All 4 One\". In addition, the DVD beFour - The Movie! was released.\n2007 saw the beginning of the production of the second studio album, Hand in Hand (The Winter Album). It appeared on 17 November 2007. The music video for the single \"Hand in Hand\" was shot in Phantasialand near Cologne. In March 2008 We Stand United, the band's third studio album, was released.

On 8 December 2010 the group announced the break-up.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Manou ===\nManuela \"Manou\" Oeschger (born 18 February 1984 in Wil (Aargau), Switzerland) had her first stage experience when she was 18. In New York, she studied dance, acting and music.\n\n\n=== Alina ===\nAlina Bock (born 2 November 1984 in Geilenkirchen, Germany) took piano lessons from the age of 6 and is an actress-in-training. She got her start with her own TV show on the German Disney Channel and as part of the Euro pop band \"beFour\".

Some of Alina's impressive American TV credits include \"Stressed Out Caucasian Mom\", \"Tired Caucasian Mom\", \"Jim & Helen Forever\", \"Adverse Possession\", \"Mary Mary & Some Other People\", \"Successful People\", and as the bumbling FBI agent Calista Flockhart in the hilarious smash hit YouTube web series \"Bad Boy\".

He had several appearances in music videos, for example Jessica Wahls (known from No Angels) - \"Du bist wie Ich\" (\"You are Like Me\").\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nIn 2009, the band was criticized for hidden and allegedly prohibited advertising appearances in schools. This happened for the company ASPECTA, a subsidiary of the insurance group Talanx. The flyer distributed at the event said it was the \"hit-and-run and unique Befour gift that is nowhere to be found: a CD of unpublished songs and a video message from your stars and a great keychain.\" For this, the parents have to provide their address and agree by signing to be contacted by an insurance broker ASPECTA Lebensversicherung AG for the purpose of making an appointment for a consultation.\nThe principals of the schools were only told that they had the \"luck\" that the tour route of the band would lead past them and the band is therefore happy to make an appearance. Subsequent to the school packages were sent with flyers, which were to be distributed to the children. For heads of schools who disagreed with the distribution, the performance was canceled at short notice because of \"lack of support\". In particular, it is criticized that children would be abused as \"door openers\". Parents would have to refuse the children the \"gifts\" if they do not want to hold sales talks with employees of the insurance group.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Other songs ===\n2009: \"Happy Holiday\"\n2009: \"Come Fly With Me\"\n\n\n== DVDs ==\nbeFour: der Film!

On 3 Oct 1992 they played at the Manly Jazz Festival at Park Royal Hotel. An audio cassette in NSW Jazz Archive collection [per estate of late Harold Denning] is held by the NSW Jazz Archive Society; leader Neil Cairns, June 2013.\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 1994 Bukovsky's album, Wanderlust (1993), won the Award for Best Jazz Album. The group have released four albums: Border Crossing (1995), Song and Dance (1999), Full Bronte (2002) and When in Rome (live album, 2008). The latter album had been recorded at Villa Celimontana, Rome in July 2004.

    "text": "Kane & Abel is an American hip hop duo formed by twin brothers Daniel and David Garcia that were founded by Master P in late 1995. They were best known for their time with No Limit Records.\n\n\n== Music career ==\n\n\n=== 1995: Keep Your Eyes Open ===\nIn early 1995, Kane & Abel signed to independent label Doral Records as Double Vision, they then released their debut album, Keep Your Eyes Open.\n\n\n=== 1996: 7 Sins ===\nIn 1996, Kane & Abel signed to Master P's record label No Limit Records. On October 8, 1996, they released their second album and first for No Limit entitled, 7 Sins. It was moderately successful, peaking at No. 179 on the Billboard 200 and No. 29 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts.\n\n\n=== 1998: Am I My Brother's Keeper ===\nOn July 7, 1998, Kane & Abel released their third album, Am I My Brother's Keeper. It was successful, selling 250,000 copies its first week, and peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts.\n\n\n=== 1999: Rise To Power ===\nIn 1999, Kane & Abel left from No Limit Records and started their own label entitled, Most Wanted Empire, later securing a new label deal with Elektra Records. On September 21, 1999, Kane & Abel released their fourth album, Rise to Power. It peaked at No. 61 on the Billboard 200 and No. 11 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.\n\n\n=== 2000-02: Most Wanted & The Last Ones Left ===\nIn 2000, Kane & Abel secured a new label deal with Geffen and MCA. On September 26, 2000, they released their fifth album, Most Wanted. It peaked at No. 194 on the Billboard 200 and No. 40 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. On October 15, 2002, Kane & Abel released their fifth album, The Last Ones Left via Entertainment Solutions.  This was because Kane & Abel were dropped from Geffen and MCA due to their legal issues at the time. The album failed to chart on any of the Billboard's listing, partly due their incarceration at the time.\n\n\n=== 2010: Back On Money ===\nIn 2010, Kane & Abel secured a new label deal with E1 Music. On September 26, 2010, their sixth album Back On Money was issued and was their first in six years.\n\n\n== Writing ==\nOn April 1, 1999, Kane & Abel released their first written novel entitled Eyes of a Killer/Behind Enemy Lines.\n\n\n== Legal issues ==\nIn 1999, the Garcias became entangled in a federal case involving the activities of convicted New Orleans drug lord Richard Pena. Investigators alleged that they distributed cocaine for Pena. During the investigation, they were asked to testify against Percy Miller (Master P), but refused, and Miller was never charged in the case. In June (two years after Pena had pled guilty on his own), the Garcias agreed to a plea bargain allowing them to plead guilty to drug possession with intent to distribute. Under the agreement, they served six months in a prison boot camp and the rest of the 24-month sentence in a halfway house, or home detention. On May 7, 2001, the brothers' lawyers reached an agreement with prosecutors in which they admitted to committing misprision of felony, by refusing to report to federal agents about Pena's activities, for which they were sentenced to three years in jail on September 14, 2001.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Collaboration albums ===\n\n\n=== Soundtrack albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n=== As lead artist ===\n\n\n=== As featured artist ===\n\n\n== Guest appearances ==\n\n1997\n\"Pop Goes My 9\" off the TRU album Tru 2 da Game\n\"West to South' off the Steady Mobb'n album Pre-Meditated Drama\n\"For Realz\" off the I'm Bout It soundtrack\n\"Mama's Family\" of the Mia X album Unlady Like\n\"5 Hollow points\" of the Mr. Serv-On album Life Insurance\n\"Throw 'em Up\" off the Master P album Ghetto D\n1998\n\"What Gangstas Do\" off the Silkk The Shocker album Charge It 2 da Game\n\"Soldiers\" off the C-Murder album Life or Death\n\"Tell Me What You're Lookin' For\" off the I Got The Hook Up soundtrack\n\"What Cha Mean\" off the Fiend album There's One in Every Family\n\"N.L.

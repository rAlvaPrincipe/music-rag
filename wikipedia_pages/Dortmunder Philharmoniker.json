The orchestra of the Theater Dortmund performs opera in the Opernhaus Dortmund and concert in the Konzerthaus Dortmund. The orchestra was founded in 1887 and has been shaped by conductors such as Wilhelm Schüchter, Marek Janowski, Moshe Atzmon and Jac van Steen.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Dortmunder Philharmoniker were founded as Orchesterverein in 1887. They played at different locations until the Stadttheater was opened in 1904. Since then they played also opera.\nThe names of orchestra changed with organisational and functional changes, Hüttner Kapelle, Städtisches Orchester (Orchestra of the City), Philharmonisches Orchester der Stadt Dortmund, Philharmonisches Orchester Dortmund, now Dortmunder Philharmoniker. The concert venue after World War II was the Kleine Westfalenhalle. In 1966 they opened the new opera house Opernhaus Dortmund with a performance of Der Rosenkavalier, conducted by Wilhelm Schüchter. Its hall was also used for symphony concerts until 2002, when the Konzerthaus Dortmund opened as the orchestra's home.\nAs of 2010, the orchestra had grown to 102 musicians. The principal conductor has the title Generalmusikdirektor:\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe Dortmunder Philharmiker perform regular concerts and also concerts for young listeners, Familienkonzerte (family concerts) for people from five years up, and Konzerte für junge Leute (concerts for young people).\nIn October 2006 they toured in China, in Shanghai and Beijing among others, conducted by Arthur Fagen.\nIn 2010 they participated in the Festival Klangvocal with music of Hans Werner Henze and Richard Wagner. Henze's Symphony No. 5, Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder in Henze's version, and the first act of Die Walküre were performed with soloists Angela Denoke and Stig Andersen, conducted by Jac van Steen. It is part of a project begun in 2009 to perform all symphonies of Henze, whose mother was born in nearby Witten.\nThe Dortmunder Philharmoniker recorded a CD in 2010, works of Antonín Dvořák, including his Symphony No. 6 and concert overtures.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBernhard Schaub: Sinfonie der Hundert.

The group has released two studio albums, Y2K: The Album in 1999 and Loyalty in 2001, and a compilation album Screwed Up in 2004.\nTheir first album, Y2K, released by Tommy Boy Records,  was a minor success, reaching number 50 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It featured contributions from Godfather Don, Big Noyd, Capone, Cormega, MC Shan, Mobb Deep, Nature, Pete Rock and Marley Marl among others, and included two chart singles: \"H-O-S-T-Y-L-E\" produced by Mike Heron and \"F.A.Y.B.A.N. (Fuck All You Bitch Ass Niggas)\" produced by DJ Premier. The follow-up album, Loyalty, released by Landspeed Records, had more success than its preceder, peaking at number 185 on the US Billboard 200 and number 44 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. It featured contributions from Ayatollah, Kool G Rap, N.O.R.E., Tragedy Khadafi, The Beatnuts, Cormega, Godfather Don and Nature among others. Its lead single, \"Torture\" produced by Lee Stone, featured M.O.P. and became the group's highest charted single at No. 78 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and #2 on the Hot Rap Songs charts. All the group members, along with Noyd, R.A. the Rugged Man and their frequent collaborator Godfather Don, appeared on Hostyle's first solo album, One Eyed Maniac, released on June 29, 2004, by Hydra Entertainment. In July 2004, the group released a compilation of new and old material, Screwed Up, which was named after their first single and is considered their final project. KL died in 2008 of an asthma attack and Hostyle died in 2020.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== The Poet ===\n\nWilbur Bass a.k.a. Poet was earlier heard in the diss song \"Beat You Down\" towards Boogie Down Productions from the Bridge Wars during 1987. As a part of hip hop group PhD with Dante \"DJ Hot Day\" Franklin, he released the duo's only studio album, Without Warning, on August 31, 1991, through Tuff City Records. The album is not well known, but his lyrical flow and content give the album its share of publicity. The album's only guest star was young Cormega on the track \"Set It Off\". After several singles by PhD, Poet and Hot Day parted ways in 1996 due to being unable to find another record label.\nBlaq Poet's first solo album, Rewind: Deja Screw, was released in 2006 by Traffic Entertainment Group and featured his own production skills along with contributions from DJ Premier, Alchemist, Easy Mo Bee, Teflon, with KL the only featured Screwball member. In the same year, he signed with DJ Premier's Year Round Records. Poet and DJ Premier appeared on the song \"The Victory\" by KRS-One and Marley Marl's album Hip Hop Lives, which ended KRS and Poet's rivalry during the Bridge Wars. He also appeared on the NYG'z first 2007 album, Welcome 2 G-Dom, also released by Year Round Records.

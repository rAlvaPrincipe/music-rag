    "text": "The Michael Nyman Orchestra is a group that expands on the Michael Nyman Band for specific album work, often for movie soundtracks.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1993, the Michael Nyman Band joined an orchestra for the first time in their recording history with MGV: Musique Ã  Grand Vitesse.  The album credit is to \"The Michael Nyman Band and Orchestra\".\nThe Michael Nyman Orchestra has operated as a formal group since then.  Such soundtrack albums as Practical Magic, Ravenous, The End of the Affair, The Claim, and The Libertine are credited to this Orchestra. While the former two titles lack detailed credits, the latter three albums show that most of the Orchestra has remained consistent.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nFrom the 2000 soundtrack album The Claim.\n\n\n=== Violin ===\n\n\n=== Viola ===\n\n\n=== Cello ===\n\n\n=== Double Bass ===\n\n\n=== Bass guitar ===\nMartin Elliott\n\n\n=== Oboe/Cor Anglais ===\nChris Hooker\n\n\n=== Clarinet/Bass Clarinet ===\nDave Fuest\n\n\n=== Flute/Piccolo ===\nJonathan Snowden\n\n\n=== Soprano Sax/Alto Sax ===\n\n\n=== Baritone Sax ===\nAndy Findon\n\n\n=== Trumpet/Flugel/Piccolo Trumpet ===\nSteve Sidwell\n\n\n=== French Horn ===\n\n\n=== Trombone/Tuba ===\nNigel Barr\n\n\n=== Percussion ===\nGreg Knowles"

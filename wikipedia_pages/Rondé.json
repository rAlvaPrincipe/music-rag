    "text": "Rondé is an indie pop band from Utrecht in the Netherlands that was formed in 2014. The group consists of singer Rikki Borgelt, bassist Cas Oomen, guitarist Armel Paap and drummer Sharon Zarr. Rondé won the 3FM Serious Talent Award from Dutch radio station NPO 3FM in 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\nA school assignment at the Herman Brood Academie led to the formation of Rondé in the spring of 2014. In April of that year the band took part in Herman Brood Academie on Tour, a short tour along various Dutch pop stages. As OOR Talent, the band participated in the Popronde in September 2014, which is a traveling music festival that visits numerous Dutch cities and towns each year.\nIn October 2014, their single \"Run\" were proclaimed 3FM Serious Talent and 3FM Megahit respectively. After their performance at Eurosonic Noorderslag in 2015, vocalist Rikki Borgelt had surgery on her vocal cords due to sustaining vocal cord nodules. In April 2015 the band won the 3FM Serious Talent Award, and a few days later their single \"We Are One\" became Rondé's second 3FM Megahit.\nThe band's first album, the eponymous Rondé, was released on 13 January 2017. Their second album Flourish was released on 8 March 2019, containing twelve songs including 3FM Megahit \"Calling\". Another 3FM Megahit by Rondé, \"Get To You\", was released in 2020. Their most recent track (and 3FM Megahit) is \"Hard To Say Goodbye\", which was rewarded with the Harde Schijf and Favourite Track awards from Dutch station Radio 538 in August 2021.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2015 - Winner 3FM Serious Talent Award\n2018 - Winner Schaal van Rigter (with Naturally)\nRun: 3FM Megahit, two times Favoruudschijf\nWe Are One: 3FM Megahit\nWhy Do You Care: 3FM Megahit, Harde Schijf (Radio 538)\nNaturally: Topsong NPO Radio 2, Harde Schijf (Radio 538), Schaal van Rigter\nHeadlights: Topsong NPO Radio 2\nCalling: Topsong NPO Radio 2, 3FM Megahit\nGet To You: 3FM Megahit\nHard To Say Goodbye: Harde Schijf (Radio 538), Favourite Track (Radio 538), 3FM Megahit\n\n\n== References =="

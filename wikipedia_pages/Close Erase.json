The first two album releases were Close Erase (1996) and No.2 (1999) on the label NorCD, with Audun Kleive as producer. They turned electric on the third album Dance This (2002) that was nominated for the Spellemannprisen and was acclaimed by the magazines The Wire and Jazzwise before their London debut September 10, 2002, and was \"shocked by this highly original trio\". The fourth album release was Sport Rocks (2006), with an increasingly hard-swinging and electronic style à la Supersilent.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1996: Close Erase (NorCD)\n1999: No. 2 (NorCD)\n2002: Dance This (Bergland Produsjon)\n2006: Sport Rocks (Jazzaway)\nCompilation\n\n2010: R.I.P.

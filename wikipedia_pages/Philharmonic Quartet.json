    "text": "The Philharmonic Quartet was an English string quartet musical ensemble founded during the period of the First World War and remaining active until the early 1940s, by which time none of the original members were present in the group.\n\n\n== Original members ==\n1st violin: Arthur Beckwith\n2nd violin: Eugene Aynsley Goossens\nViola: Raymond Jeremy\nVioloncello: Cedric Sharpe\n\n\n== Early history ==\nThe quartet championed works by British composers, giving the first performances of works by Arnold Bax, Cyril Rootham and Arthur Bliss. They also performed several works by Eugene Aynsley Goossens, including his String Quartet op.14, which dedicated each of its movements to a member of the group. In addition to performances of standard repertoire by Beethoven and Mozart, the quartet played contemporary works by Ravel, Stravinsky and Debussy.\nSome of the players were conscripted into active service during the First World War. When the quartet reappeared in 1918, Goossens had been replaced by 'F. Holding'. The following year, Arthur Beckwith was replaced by 'Mr Peatfield'. Cedric Sharpe was later to found the Virtuoso Quartet in 1924 and was joined by Raymond Jeremy.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nThe Philharmonic Quartet made several recordings for the Gramophone Company on the HMV label:\n\nGlazunov 5 Novelettes Op.15 - (iv) Valse\nCoates: Bouree\nBoccherini: Minuet, G275 (Recorded 12 July 1915)\nBridge: Cherry ripe\nBridge: Sally in our alley (Recorded 25 March 1918)\nBridge: Irish melody (Recorded 25 March 1918)\nBridge: Idylls, string quartet (Recorded 9 January 1920)\nGlazunov: Oriental, op.15, no.2 (1 June 1920)\nHolbrooke: Piano Quartet No. 2 in G minor Op. 21\nHolbrooke: Folksong suite no.1 (Recorded 25 March 1918)\nMendelssohn: String quartet no.1 (Recorded 27 March 1916)\nMendelssohn: Spring song (Recorded 27 March 1916)\nMozart: Minuet in D minor (Recorded 9 January 1920)\nRavel: String quartet, F major (Recorded 25 March 1918)\nSchubert: String quartet no.14, D810, D minor.

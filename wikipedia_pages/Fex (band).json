    "text": "Fex (stylized as FEX) is a German new wave band based and formed in Kiel in 1983. They are best known for the song \"Subways of Your Mind\", previously unofficially referred to as \"The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet\", which became notable for being the subject of a 17-year-long internet search to identify the original artist. \nDuring a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" thread, band member Michael Hädrich said that \"we had songs for a full 2 set concert\", but only 6 songs were recorded by Fex during their initial run in the 1980s. The discovery of \"Subways of Your Mind\" also unveiled two other songs on the same demo tape, \"Heart in Danger\" and \"Talking Hands\". The song  \"Jenny\" was found in a song compilation released by Zeus. Fex eventually put the B-side of the demo tape, \"Goldrush\", on YouTube, while the possible sixth, \"Right and Wrong\", is still to be revealed.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to guitarist Ture Rückwardt, Fex started in a rehearsal room in the Heikendorf industrial area. His wife Ilona was the lead vocalist before she went on maternity leave, prompting him to become the singer. The name of the band derives from a Southern German slang word, akin to \"zealot\" or \"nerd\", regarding someone passionately enthusiastic about something. By 1984, the band's lineup consisted of Rückwardt, keyboardist Michael Hädrich, drummer Hans-Reimer Sievers and bassist Norbert Ziermann.\nFex started to gain more exposure outside Kiel with their participation in the Newcomer Show music competition, which was hosted in 1984 by radio and television personality Manfred Sexauer and organized by Hamburg-based insurance broker Zeus. The competition was held at the Die Glocke concert hall in Bremen, where the band beat out seven other finalists. One of the rewards was the contribution of a track, \"Jenny\", to the Top-Hits compilation album that was later released in 1985. In January 1985, they announced a tour of Northern Germany scheduled for that March. Later that year, the band performed at the Bruchhausen-Festival. The band had recorded only six songs before their dissolution as Hädrich decided to relocate to Munich.\n\n\n== Reunion ==\nOn November 7, 2024, Rückwardt, Hädrich and Ziermann reunited to perform a live acoustic version of \"Subways of Your Mind\" on German radio station NDR 1 Welle Nord. This was the band's first performance since dissolving in the mid-1980s. On November 8, Sievers contacted NDR 1 for an interview after reading about the band's reunion in a local newspaper, and was subsequently put in contact with the other band members.\nOn December 9, Berlin-based label The Outer Edge announced a 7\" vinyl release of the original demo version of \"Subways of Your Mind\" as a single, with \"Heart in Danger\" on the B-side, for a January 2025 release.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\n\nMichael Hädrich – keyboard, vocals, guitar (1983–1985; 2024–present)\nTure Rückwardt – composer, vocals, guitar (1983–1985; 2024–present)\nHans-Reimer Sievers – drums (1983–1985; 2024–present)\nNorbert Ziermann – bass (1984–1985; 2024–present)\nFormer members\n\nIlona Rückwardt – vocals (1983–1984)\nDirk Reichardt – keyboard\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSongs\n\"Subways of Your Mind\" (c. 1983)\n\"Heart in Danger\" (c. 1983)\n\"Talking Hands\" (c. 1983)\n\"Goldrush\" (c. 1980s)\n\"Skyscraper\"\n\"Jenny\" (1985) (on compilation album ZEUS Top-Hits)\n\"Right and Wrong\"\n\"It's Good to Know\"\n\"Hard Ride\"\n\"Second Hand Love\"\n\"Persecution Mania\"\n\"Influence\"\n\"Talk About\"\n\"Killing Joke\"\n\"Dead End\"\n\"Promise\"\n\"Epcot\"\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Holy Nothing is a Portuguese electronic band formed in the city of Porto, in 2013 by Pedro Rodrigues, Nelson Silva and Samuel Gonçalves. With two albums and one EP released, the trio mixes tropical rhythms with industrial sounds, synthesizers and groove boxes in their music production, generating an unconventional electronic sound.\nThe trio became friends while living in the city of Porto, Portugal, but at the beginning of the band, all three members were in different places: Nelson Silva was in Porto, Pedro Rodrigues in the Netherlands and Samuel Gonçalves in Chile, having done the initial musical work together via the internet. In 2013, they released the first singles from the project: \"Given Up\" and \"Nothing is Fun\", which preceded the release of their first EP Boundaries (2014), the result of musical mockups produced in the period which were separated.\nIn 2015, the band debuted with the first LP: Hypertext. The critically acclaimed album was responsible for placing Holy Nothing on the lineup of major festivals around the world, such as SXSW (2016), Eurosonic (2017) and Waves Vienna and Iceland Airwaves, both in 2018. Besides the international performances, the trio also played in all major Portuguese music festivals, such as NOS Primavera Sound, Vodafone Paredes de Coura, and others.\nThe live performances of the band are enriched with the visual arts and the light design of the Portuguese artists Bruno Albuquerque, João Pessegueiro e Rui Monteiro. For 2019, they plan on releasing their second LP Plural Real Animal, an album marked by collaboration with Brazilian and Portuguese artists such as BaianaSystem and Moullinex.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nPedro Rodrigues: vocals and groovebox\nSamuel Gonçalves: bass and drum pad\nNelson Silva: synth and drum pad\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== EP ===\nBoundaries (2014)\n\n\n=== LPs ===\nHypertext (2015)\nPlural Real Animal (2019)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Given Up\" (2013)\n\"Nothing is Fun\" (2013)\n\"Speed of Sound\" (2017)\n\"Home\" (featuring Muhaisnah Four) (2017)\n\"Underdog\" (2018)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBandCamp Holy Nothing\nSoundCloud Holy Nothing"

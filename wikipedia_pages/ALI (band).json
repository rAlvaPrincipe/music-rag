    "text": "ALI (acronym for Alien Liberty International) is a Japanese band formed in Shibuya, Tokyo, in 2016, known for their unique fusion of hip hop, funk, jazz, and global influences. The band gained fame through their hit anime soundtracks, including \"Wild Side\" for BEASTARS and \"LOST IN PARADISE\" for Jujutsu Kaisen. All members of the band are mixed with roots in Japan, Europe, America, Asia, and Africa.\nIn May 2021, ALI went on indefinite hiatus following the arrest of their drummer, Kahadio, for fraud. After a six-month break, the band returned in November 2021.\nAs of October 2024, ALI is now a solo project led by vocalist Leo, continuing the band’s signature cross-genre sound after the departure of key members Luthfi and César.\n\n\n== Career ==\nALI (Alien Liberty International), a multinational hip-hop and funk band, was formed in 2016 in Shibuya, Tokyo. The group drew inspiration from global influences, blending roots from Japan, Europe, America, Asia, and Africa. Named after the legendary boxer Muhammad Ali, the band sought to embody his energy, presence, and ideals of unity through their music.\nALI gained widespread recognition in 2019 with their debut single, \"Wild Side,\" which served as the opening theme for the anime BEASTARS.  This marked a turning point for the band, showcasing their cross-genre appeal. Their subsequent single, \"LOST IN PARADISE\" featuring rapper AKLO, became the ending theme for Jujutsu Kaisen, further cementing their place in the Japanese music scene.\nHowever, On May 14, 2021, ALI faced controversy when their drummer, Kahadio, was arrested for fraud, leading to the cancellation of their contracts with Sony Music and the removal of their track \"Teenage City Riot\" from The World Ends with You: The Animation. The scandal resulted in the band's indefinite hiatus in May 2021. Kahadio was expelled from the group, and ALI publicly apologized to their fans and the victims of the crime.\nAfter six months, ALI made their return in November 2021, continuing to produce music and perform live. Despite the setback, the band persisted, showcasing their resilience and passion for music. On February 23, 2022, the band released the EP \"Inglourious Eastern Cowboy\". On January 25, 2023 they released their debut album \"Music World\".\nIn July 2024, they performed at Anime Friends in Brazil.\nIn October 2024, ALI transitioned into a solo project led by vocalist Leo Imamura after key members, guitarist César and bassist Luthfi, left the group to pursue new ventures. \n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\n\nLeo Imamura – vocals (2016–present)\nFormer members\n\nJua – rapping (2016–2020)\nZeru – guitar (2016–2020)\nKahadio (Kadio Shirai) – drums (2016–2021)\nYu Hagiwara – saxophone (2017–2021)\nJin Inoue – keyboard (2019–2021)\nAlexander Taiyo Fidel – percussion (2016–2022)\nLuthfi Rizki Kusumah – bass guitar (2016–2024)\nAiichiro César Tanaka – guitar (2020–2024)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Mini albums ====\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== Digital singles ====\n\n\n==== Collaboration singles ====\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn November 2020, it was announced that the band would perform the opening theme song for the 2021 anime The World Ends with You the Animation with \"Teenage City Riot\". On April 4, 2021, however, it was announced that the opening song would be changed due to drummer Kahadio being arrested for participating in a refund scam. On April 23, 2021, Kahadio was arrested again for a separate fraud case. Kahadio and his friends were offering an elderly woman a refund for medical expenses in exchange of transferring her money to an account. He then withdrew half of the money from the same account. Due to the controversy, the band went on indefinite hiatus on May 14, 2021, as well as pulling most of their songs off streaming platforms. They returned from hiatus, and their music was restored on November 18.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

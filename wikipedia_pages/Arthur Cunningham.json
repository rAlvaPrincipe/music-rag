    "text": "Arthur Cunningham (November 11, 1928, Piermont, New York – March 31, 1997, Nyack, New York) was an American composer and educator. His students included singer Kate Davidson, producer/engineer Peter Francovilla, pianist John Ellis, and Berklee Press editor-in-chief Jonathan Feist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCunningham began composing music at the age of 12, which he performed with his jazz band. He attended Fisk University (BA, 1951), Juilliard (1951–1952), and Columbia University's Teachers College, where he earned his Master’s degree in 1957. In 1951, the National Association of Negro Musicians held a concert featuring his works. Cunningham served in the United States Army from 1955 to 1957, during which time he composed music for army bands and television.\nBetween 1963 and 1973, Cunningham wrote seven large-scale stage works, incorporating a wide range of popular musical styles, including jazz, gospel, and rock. Some of his compositions bear similarities to, and even predate, the concept of rock opera.\n\n\n== Musical Compositions and Stage works ==\nPatsy Patch and Susan’s Dream (rock musical for children; libretto by Cunningham; first performed in Orangeburg, New York, 27 April 1963)\nThe Beauty Part (musical show with improvised piano accompaniment; libretto by S.

It is my wish to continue that tradition and spirit of the jubilee song and to extend its boundaries to include contemporary compositional techniques.\"\nNight Song (1973; theatre piece, unperformed; texts in Swahili, Gullah, and English)\nHouse by the Sea (libretto by Cunningham; incomplete)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nWright, Josephine. \"Cunningham, Arthur\".

    "text": "CD9 is a Mexican boy band formed in 2013. The original line-up consisted of William Valdés, Freddy Leyva, Alan Navarro, Jos Canela, and Alonso Villalpando. William Valdés left the group in October 2013 and was replaced by Bryan Mouque, whereas Jos Canela worked as the group's leader until his departure in May 2019.\nTheir training was given in 2013, in  Mexico City. The members came up with the name because they claim that the term—which is an acronym for \"Code 9\"—is used to change the topic of conversation and that reflects who they are.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn August 2013, they independently published \"The Party\", and it quickly managed to draw the attention of the record company Sony Music México with whom they signed a recording contract. Then William Valdés, due to problems with management, left the group and was replaced by Bryan Mouque.\nIn the first half of 2014, they released two EPs, which managed to position itself at the top of sales in their country of origin. Later, at the end of September of the same year, the label released their studio debut homonymous-named album and in a month it obtained a certification of gold by AMPROFON after overcoming 30,000 copies sold. To promote their album, they carried out The Party Tour concert tour in Latin America.\nIn the first two months of 2015, they released their rebounded debut album: CD9: Love & Live Edition which includes live material from their tour. Of their first record productions seal they have released four singles: \"The Party\", \"Ángel Cruel\", \"Me Equivoqué\" and \"Eres\"; then they later appeared in the charts as Top Latin Songs of Latin Monitor as one of the most played songs.\nIn 2016, they performed the theme song for the film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. The song was an updated version of the theme song for the original cartoon TV show. They later collaborated with K-pop girl group Crayon Pop for a single titled \"Get Dumb\", releasing both an English version and a Spanish/Korean version.\nIn May 2019, amidst rumors of him leaving the group after he was frequently absent from concerts, Jos Canela released a statement on Twitter confirming his departure from CD9 after six years with the group.\nThe group has been inactive since the end of their Modo Avión tour which concluded on April 24, 2019, as well as the departure of Jos Canela.\nOn March 10, 2021, after almost two years of inactivity and the departure of members Jos Canela and Freddy Leyva, the band officially confirmed their separation through their Twitter account.\nOn April 6, 2024, the group's social media accounts were reactivated with a caption that describes: April 9. On April 9, 2024, they announce a unique show in Mexico City for July 19, due to the speed in which tickets were sold setting a national record, thus creating a tour with another 20 concerts added throughout Mexico until November 30.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nFormer members\n\nWilliam Valdés – lead vocals (2013)\nJos Canela – lead vocals (2013–2019)\nFreddy Leyva – lead vocals (2013–2019)\nAlonso Villalpando – lead vocals (2013–2021)\nAlan Navarro – lead vocals (2013–2021)\nBryan Mouque – lead vocals (2013–2021)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n== Concert tours ==\nThe Party Tour (2014–15)\nThe Party World Tour (2015–16)\nEvolution Tour (2016–17)\nRevolution Tour (2016–17)\nModo Avión Tour (2018–19)\n\n\n== References =="

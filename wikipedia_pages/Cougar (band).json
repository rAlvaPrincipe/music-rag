    "text": "Cougar is an instrumental post-rock band from Madison, Wisconsin, formed in 2003. Formerly on the Madison-based record label Layered Music (the label of Youngblood Brass Band, of which drummer D.H. Skogen is also a member). Cougar toured the United States, Europe and the UK on the release of their debut album Law during early 2007, including a well-received show in Madison.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Law ===\nLaw is Cougar's début album. It was recorded at Layered Studios in Madison and released by Layered Music in Europe in February 2006, and in America release was one year later, on February 20, 2007.

Rock Sound reviewer Dan Morgan illustrated the album's sound: \"polyrhythmic Fugazi structures merge delicately with angelic post rock and the sort of even-handed electronica that 65daysofstatic might produce if their parents forced them onto Ritalin.\" Likewise, Alexander Tudor of Drowned in Sound questioned the categorisation of the band and their sound: \"Does the grey area between (guitar-led, crescendo-prone) post-rock and instrumental electronica actually have a name we can agree on… or is this what Simon Reynolds had in mind when he coined post-rock, in the mid-Nineties?\" Structurally, he compares the album to Mogwai's Mr Beast, Björk and Meanwhile, back in Communist Russia.... Writing for the NME, Matt Warwick describes the track \"Florida Logic\" as \"Mars Volta-inspired\".\n\nBand members\n\nDavid Henzie-Skogen – percussion; recording\nTodd Hill – bass guitar\nTrent Johnson – guitar\nAaron Sleator – electronics, synths and guitar; recording\nDan Venne – guitar; recording\nNic Cowles – flute on \"Absaroka\"\nSinead Nic Gearailt – harp on \"Pelourinho\"\nJames Murray – vocals on \"Rhinelander\"\nNat McIntosh – euphonium on \"Absaroka\"\nDaniel Miles – bass clarinet on \"This is an Affidavit\" and \"Absaroka\"\nScott Pauli – photography and design\nAmelia Royko – vocals on \"Rhinelander\"\nAnna Suechting – French horn on \"This is an Affidavit\" and \"Absaroka\"\nRoger Siebel – mastering\nBeau Sorenson – mixing\nPeter Streicher – photography and design\nReviews\n\nDrowned in Sound (7/10)\nNME (8/10)\nRock Sound (8/10)\n\n\n== Resources ==\nMySpace\nOfficial web site\n\n\n== See also ==\nCultural significance of the cougar in North America\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestra was a Bulgarian orchestra whose origins date back to 1945. It is rooted in the hundred-year-old orchestral traditions of the largest cultural center of Thrace. The German neo-classical band Haggard performed with them as part of their Tales of Ithiria tour in 2010, marking their first live concert with an actual orchestra.  At 2012, the orchestra was closed and not working anymore.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nMozart Opera Arias for Mezzo-Soprano and Orchestra – Irena Petkova (mezzo-soprano), Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestra, Nayden Todorov (conductor), 1999.

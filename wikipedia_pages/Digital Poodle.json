    "text": "Digital Poodle was an electro-industrial/EBM band, based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was formed in 1986 and remained active until about 1995.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFormed in 1986 by vocalist/programmer Heiki Sillaste (aka Mouth 392), the project was considered Toronto's answer to the established Vancouver-based industrial acts like Skinny Puppy, and Front Line Assembly. Digital Poodle's sound can be best described as house/techno mixed with European Electronic body music (EBM) and occasionally skirting experimental and ambient soundscapes. Sillaste's lyrical themes and choice of audio sampling typically covered the ending of the Cold War, as well as the following political independence struggles in the Baltic states and Eastern Europe.\nDigital Poodle originally released a series of cassette tape demos and full release albums on Sillaste's own Shadow recording label. The first CD release was Soul Crush in 1991, which was distributed in North America under the Death of Vinyl label. This was followed in 1992 by Work Terminal which was also distributed by DoV and in Europe on Germany's Hyperium Records label. The band's final release was the Combat! EP in 1997, which contained mainly remixed material from previous releases.\nOther Digital Poodle studio members have included keyboardists Pupka Frey (of the band D.I.N.) and Reduct. Keyboard players Jean-Claude Cutz and Dave Rout were also associated with the band.  Post Digital Poodle, both joined a later configuration of Rational Youth.  Live shows of Digital Poodle featured the drummer/percussionists Kristian Helstrom, Andreas Gregor, and Dave Rout.\nIn 1995, Sillaste co-founded the Nice+Smooth Ultramedia label and has gone on to create 45 synthesizer-based albums and 120 compilation appearances. He has worked on other music projects in the genre of electronic dub, down beat, and house/techno music such as Kinder Atom and Lazer Caps, and is an accomplished graphic designer. He has also worked on music and sound for television shows such as CSI: Miami and commercials for Nissan.\nOn July 15, 2022, Digital Poodle reunited for a one-off performance as part of the Bombshelter Records' 35th anniversary event at The Garrison in Toronto. Original members Heiki Sillaste, Kristian Helstrom, Andreas Gregor, and Dave Rout took part in a 5 song set. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4AQv0lsX8Q\nDigital Poodle will play a full reunion set at Terminus Festival in Calgary, Alberta on July 26th 2024. https://terminus-festival.com/\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nInstrumental CS - side B, track #5 \"Uncivilized World\" (Plan Eleven)\nDeath of Vinyl CD - track #15 \"Broadkast III\" (DOVe, 1991)\n\"Gárgula Mecânica\" World Electrostatic Assembly CD - track #12 \"Binary\" (Simbiose, 1992)\n… To Hypersonic - The Hyperium Compilation Part II CD - track #8 \"Free Men\" (Hyperium, 1992)\nHy!

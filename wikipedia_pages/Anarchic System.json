    "text": "Anarchic System was a French pop group formed in the early 1970s.\nThe band's members were parts of other groups from the rock scene of northern France. They were in good friendship when the opportunity of recording the \"Popcorn\" cover was given to them by Paul de Senneville (of Delphine Records) in 1972. They were chosen because of Christian Lerouge's incredible ability in using a Minimoog. Commercial success (700,000 copies) gave the band an opportunity to release two other singles (\"Carmen Brasilia\" and \"Royal Summer\"), even before they were signed in 1973.\nThe band's songs are mostly attributed to electronic music due to the presence of a keyboard in \"Popcorn\", \"Carmen Brasilia\" and the long version of \"Generation\". However, other singles are influenced by rock genres. Their influence were Uriah Heep, Warhorse, Black Sabbath and such.\nTheir songs were written by Paul de Senneville and Olivier Toussaint for the first singles (including \"Generation\"), then they changed to C. Gordanne, C. Van Loo and I. Wira for the following releases, only achieving to impose their own songs on the release \"Goody Lady\" in 1977.\n\n\n== Musicians ==\nGilles Devos: vocals;\nJacques Deville: vocals and guitar;\nPatrick Verette:  bass;\nChristian Lerouge: keyboards, Minimoog;\nMichel Dhuy: drums.\nThe musicians were involved in other line up :\n\nGilles Devos: vocals in Try Again;\nJacques Deville: guitar in Les Lynx.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nPussycat c'est la vie (1974)\nGeneration (1975)\nSugar Baby Mission Space Recording (1976)\n\n\n=== Compilations and appearances ===\nAnarchic System\nDolann√®s Melodies (1975): movies soundtracks, songs played by Jean-Claude Borelly, Anarchic System (the song \"Starlight\" instrumental) and Pop Concerto Orchestra\nJean-Claude Borelly (1978): featuring with the song \"Wish to Know Why\"\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Popcorn\" (1972)\n\"Carmen Brasilia\" (1972)\n\"Royal Summer\" (1973)\n\"Cherie Sha La La\" (1973)\n\"Pussycat c'est la vie\" (1974)\n\"Love, Oh My Love Amour\" (1974)\n\"Nana Guili Guili Gouzy Gouzy\" (1975)\n\"Generation\" (1975)\n\"Stop It\" (1976)\n\"Daddy, Mammy, Juddy, Jimmy, Jully and All the Family\" (1976)\n\"Goody Lady\" (1977)\nReleased by AZ Records but without intervention of the former members:\n\n\"Movie Star\" (1983)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in French) Review of vinyls\n(in French) \"Try Again\" official page\nAnarchic System discography at Discogs\nAnarchic System at IMDb"

    "text": "The Cleveland Chamber Symphony (CCS) is an American chamber orchestra based in Cleveland, Ohio.  It is dedicated to the performance of contemporary classical music,and has presented over 200 performance premieres. They work in partnership with Baldwin-Wallace Conservatory of Music.\nEvery spring, the Cleveland Chamber Symphony holds the Young and Emerging Composers Concert, which exclusively features music created by student composers, selected through a competitive process.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Cleveland Chamber Symphony was founded in 1980, by composer Edwin London, as a professional ensemble to perform new music, primarily made by American composers. Through Dr London and a dedicated core of Cleveland musicians, the ensemble steadily grew in scope and stature throughout the following two decades, performing, recording, and commissioning contemporary orchestral music.\nAt the peak of its activity, the CCS presented a concert series of eight programs and numerous recording sessions under the direction of Edwin London. Performances were offered at Cleveland State University, and many other Cleveland venues, notably the Cleveland Museum of Art, Trinity Cathedral, Public Hall, Karamu House, Liberty Hill Baptist Church, Old Stone Church, and John Carroll University. The ensemble offered \"encore\" performances in communities adjacent to Cuyahoga County and throughout the Midwest.\nComposers in Cleveland and around the world began to see the Cleveland Chamber Symphony as an important resource for their work and that of younger students. Composers of national and international stature, whose works were commissioned and performed by the CCS were invited as guest conductors and pedagogues. A hallmark of the ensemble was the close collaborative relationship it shared with many composers. To some, the CCS set a new standard for the performance of contemporary orchestral music. A critically acclaimed performance of Bernard Rands' Canti Trilogy led to a national tour culminating in a performance in Paine Hall at Harvard University.\nIn 2007, the group won a Grammy Award in the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with orchestra) category, for its recording of Olivier Messiaen's Oiseaux exotiques  conducted by John McLaughlin Williams with pianist Angelin Chang.\nThe current music director is Franz Welser-Möst\nWhile the orchestra was first formed at Cleveland State University, it has since moved to a new performance home at the Cleveland Music School Settlement.\n\n\n== Select recordings ==\n Sound Encounters I \n(GM 2039)\n\nLibby Larsen: What the Monster Saw\nSalvatore Martirano: LON/dons - Howie Smith, saxophone\nBernard Rands: London Serenade\nRoger Reynolds: The Dream of the Infinite Rooms - Regina Mushabac, cello\n The New American Scene \n(Albany Records, Troy 298)\n\nRonald Perera: Music for Flute and Orchestra - William Wittig, flute\nHowie Smith: Songs for the Children - Howie Smith, wind controller/alto saxophone\nEdwin London: Una Novella Della Sera Primavera - Harry Sargous, oboe\nJohn Eaton: Songs of Desperation & Comfort - Nelda Nelson, mezzo-soprano\nCleveland Chamber Symphony Vol 6↵ (TNC CD 1515)\n\nDanceanu: Chinonic, Op. 67\nMessiaen: Oiseaux Exotiques (Exotic Birds) - Angelin Chang - piano\nLigeti: Chamber Concerto for 13 Instrumentalists\nShostakovich: Concerto no. 1 for Piano and Orchestra, Op. 35 - Angelin Chang, piano\nThe recording of Oiseaux Exotiques by Olivier Messiaen has been awarded a 2007 Grammy Award in the category of Classical Music: Best Instrumental Solo with Orchestra\n18. 175 my 94m3\n\n\n== See also ==\nCity Music Cleveland\nCleveland Orchestra\nCleveland Philharmonic\nCleveland Women's Orchestra\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nNEO Sonic Fest\nCleveland Chamber Symphony's channel on YouTube\nCleveland Chamber Symphony on Facebook\nCleveland Chamber Symphony at AllMusic\nCleveland Chamber Symphony discography at Discogs\nInterview with Edwin London by Bruce Duffie, January 29, 1989"

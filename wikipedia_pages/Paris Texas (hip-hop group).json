    "text": "Paris Texas is an American alternative hip hop duo founded in Los Angeles, California in 2018 by rapper-producers Louie Pastel and Felix. The duo's name is a reference to the 1984 road movie Paris, Texas. Their music has been noted for resembling the work of OutKast, King Krule, and Cities Aviv, among others.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2013–2018: Early years ===\nLouie Pastel and Felix met during freshman year in community college in 2013 after being introduced through a mutual friend and quickly bonded over their shared love for Florida rapper Robb Banks. \"I had a French class with this kid Jesus. Funniest dude I ever met in my life. They had been friends already through high school. I told Jesus I made beats. He was rapping and said he has a friend who raps too\", Louie retells in an interview. The two experienced great chemistry from the start, and within a few months, they had begun making music together.\n\n\n=== 2018–2019: Formation and I'll Get My Revenge in Hell ===\nIn 2018, Louie and Felix officially formed Paris Texas. They put out their debut EP titled I'll Get My Revenge in Hell in October of the same year. It featured six tracks including one interlude and a feature from BBY Kodie.\n\n\n=== 2021–2022: Rebranding, Boy Anonymous, and Red Hand Akimbo ===\nIn February 2021, Paris Texas re-emerged on the scene after scraping most of their previous work off of the Internet—the exception being I'll get my revenge in hell, which has remained available on their SoundCloud profile. With the help of their new manager Mike Ahern (who also manages American pop singer Clairo), they started to re-release older tracks and distribute them onto streaming services. First out was the single \"Heavy Metal\" on February 17, which later was followed up by the songs \"Situations\" and \"Force of Habit\", which dropped in March and April respectively. These three tracks were soon revealed to be part of their new album, Boy Anonymous, which arrived in May 2021 and was praised by critics for its \"unmistakable intensity and energy of intention\". In September 2021, they surprised fans by releasing yet another single, \"Girls like drugs\". Red Hand Akimbo arrived merely two weeks later, on October 6, without any notice beforehand.\nOn July 8, 2022, the group released the standalone single \"Cyanide\" featuring Cryogeyser.\n\n\n=== 2023: Mid Air ===\n\nOn March 30, 2023, Paris Texas released \"Panic!!!\" their first release of 2023. On May 12, they followed up with \"Bullet Man\", alongside a corresponding music video. On June 16, they released the single \"Everybody’s Safe Until...\". At the same time, they announced their debut studio album Mid Air, along with its release date of July 21. On July 18, three days prior to the release of Mid Air, the final single, \"DnD\" featuring Kenny Mason, was released.\nOn January 12, 2024, the group reunited with Kenny Mason on the Billy Lemos-produced \"Big Bank\", the first single off of the Pigeons and Planes compilation album See You Next Year 2. The track was recorded at Rick Rubin's Shangri-La Studio in Malibu. On March 28, the duo appeared on \"So Long\", a single by Bien Et Toi from his EP A London Safari II, released on May 3.\n\n\n== Chromakopia Tour ==\nOn October 22, 2024, the group was announced to be accompanying Tyler the Creator on the 2025 tour for his upcoming album Chromakopia along with Lil Yachty. They will act as opening support on all concerts, while Lil Yachty will act as direct support on most, but not all, concerts.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\n\n\n== References =="

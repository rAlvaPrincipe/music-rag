    "text": "Foot Village is a tribal noise rock band based in Los Angeles, California. The band consists of members Brian Miller, Grace Lee, Gregory Witscher, and Josh Taylor.\nThe band has been described as a \"drum-n-shout assembly\". In a review of their 2009 album Anti-Magic, Pitchfork described the work of Foot Village as \"loud, spastic, and often complicated\". The band went on various tours from 2007 to 2013. Performances took place in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France; but most frequently in Los Angeles.\nFoot Village also appears on the compilation DVD Live at the Smell and on a VPRO video, filmed at an Amsterdam show. The track \"Wherever the Fuck Arnold Schwarzenegger's From\" appears on the Methodist Leisure Inc freebie funcore compilation Short Attention Span (2009, Methodist Leisure Inc.) The band have been chosen by Portishead to perform at the ATP I'll Be Your Mirror festivals that they have curated in July 2011 at London's Alexandra Palace, and in September 2011 in Asbury Park, New Jersey.\nDespite achieving little mainstream success, two of Foot Village's albums, Anti-Magic and Make Memories, have received positive reviews from online music publication Pitchfork. Experimental hip hop band Clipping featured a remix of the Foot Village track \"This Song Is a Drug Deal\" on their 2018 extended play Face.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio Albums ===\nFriendship Nation (2008)\nAnti-Magic (2009)\nWorld Fantasy (2010)\nMake Memories (2013)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nFuck The Future (2007)\nFuck The Future II (2009)\nChicken And Cheese Covers (2009)\n\n\n== Videography ==\nLive at the Smell, DVD\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFoot Village official website\nFoot Village VEVO YouTube channel\nFoot Village Spotify"

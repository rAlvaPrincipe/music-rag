They play as a two piece outfit or a full band, and have a strong and growing presence on the UK-wide live circuit and international airtime, including appearances at theatres and festivals such as Glastonbury Festival and Green Man Festival, and regular national radio appearances.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2007–2010: Formation and early performances ===\nZervas and Pepper formed in late 2007, born out of singer-songwriters Paul Zervas and Kathryn Pepper's shared love of harmony-heavy folk rock. The couple discovered one another while performing in their home town clubs in Cardiff in their native Wales as solo artists, first meeting in the Toucan Club, and decided to write and perform their own original songs as a duo. They began writing and recording together as Zervas and Pepper, and their first release was an introductory EP on the independent \"Zerodeo Records\" label in 2008 with the help of well-regarded Welsh producer Kriss Jenkins. The duo started selling out local live shows and released a second EP on the same label in 2009, whilst gaining a significant local following.\n\n\n=== 2011–2013: Debut album and establishment ===\nFollowing this encouraging reception, Zervas and Pepper released their debut album Somewhere in the City in Spring 2011 to positive feedback, and attracting interest in the music press and on national radio.

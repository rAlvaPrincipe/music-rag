    "text": "Mats/Morgan Band (formerly Hot Rats and Zappsteetoot) is a band that features Morgan Ågren and Mats Öberg. Morgan is a drummer and composer and Mats is a keyboard player and composer.  The band is a showcase for their virtuosic skills on their respective instruments as well as their compositional skills. Their music is difficult to categorize, containing elements of jazz, electronic music, waltz, dance music, avant garde/free jazz, techno, rock, progressive and modern classical music.\nMorgan Ågren has been a drummer since age four. Born in Umeå, Sweden, Ågren was spotted as an outstanding talent at a young age as he began performing publicly at age seven, and eventually joined forces with keyboardist Mats Öberg in 1981. Mats has been blind since birth.\nThey later formed Zappsteetoot together in 1984, a band internationally known for performing Frank Zappa's music. In 1988, Ågren and Öberg were invited by Zappa to do a guest performance at his Stockholm performance. Frank Zappa then invited them to the United States to partake in several projects, including the 1991 Zappa's Universe shows in New York, which Zappa was already too ill to attend, as well as a sold out New York performance of Zappa's classical program at Lincoln Centers Great Performers Series at Avery Fisher Hall.\nMorgan Ågren also collaborated with the guitarist of Swedish experimental metal band Meshuggah, Fredrik Thordendal, on the album Sol Niger Within, which was released in 1997.\n\n\n== Lineup ==\nMorgan Ågren\nMats Öberg\nwith\n\nJimmy Ågren\nRobert Elovsson\nTommy Tordsson\nGuest musicians (in recordings and events)\n\nFredrik Thordendal\nJonas Knutsson\nArtis the Spoonman\nMattias \"IA\" Eklundh\nLars Hollmer\nJJ Marsh\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Frank Zappa ===\nFrank Zappa – Stockholm 01.05.88 boot (Performed T'Mershi Duween with the band)\nVarious Artists – Zappa's Universe\nVarious Artists – Zappanale # 15 (2004, 3CD, arf society)\n\n\n=== Mats/Morgan Band ===\nTrends and Other Diseases (1996)\nThe Music or the Money… (1997)\nRadio Da Da (1998, ultimate audio entertainment)\nThe Teenage Tapes (1998, ultimate audio entertainment)\nLive (2001, ultimate audio entertainment)\nOn Air with Guests (2002, ultimate audio entertainment)\nThanks for Flying with Us (2005, Cuneiform Records)\nHeat Beats Live + Tourbook 1991–2007 (2008, Cuneiform Records)\nSchack Tati (2014, Cuneiform Records)\n35th Anniversary Collection (2016, Morgan Records (not the cars))\nLive with Norrlandsoperan Symphony Orchestra (2018, Morgan Records (not the cars))\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMats/Morgan Band's Cuneiform Records page\nMorgan Ågren's homepage\nMats/Morgan Band's United Mutation page"

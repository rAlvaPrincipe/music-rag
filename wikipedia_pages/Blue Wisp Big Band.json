    "text": "Blue Wisp Big Band was founded in 1980 by drummer John Von Ohlen and trumpeter Don Johnson. The band took its name from the Blue Wisp Jazz Club. \n\n\n== History ==\nVon Ohlen, a native of Indianapolis, moved to the Cincinnati area after many years on the road playing with Stan Kenton and Woody Herman. This inspired to start a big band.\nJohnson, who had been on the Cincinnati scene for years, suggested which instrumentalists should play in the band. Pianist Steve Schmidt and bassist Michael Sharfe were already playing with Von Ohlen at the Blue Wisp in the Steve Schmidt Trio.\nThe band started recording in 1981, releasing an album sponsored by the Cincinnati television station WKRC, then four for the Mopro label founded by Fred and Helen Morr in the 1980s. Sea Breeze reissued the Mopro albums in the 1990s. Among the group's more notable members were trumpeter Tim Hagans and bassist Lynn Seaton.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Saxophones ===\nMike Andres\nJeremy Long\nHerb Aronoff\nBrent Gallaher\nLarry Dickson\n\n\n=== Trumpets ===\nJeff Folkens\nKevin Moore\nHank Mautner\nKim Pensyl\n\n\n=== Trombones ===\nJeff Owen\nClarence Pawn\nScott Forney\nGary Langhorst (bass trombone)\n\n\n=== Rhythm section ===\nSteve Schmidt, piano\nMike Sharfe, bass\nJim Leslie, drums\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nJim Sherrick, saxophone; Joe Gaudio, saxophone; Mike Campbell, saxophone; Steve Hoskins, saxophone; Eddie Morgan, trombone; Paul Piller, trombone; Scott Acree, trombone; Kirk Shields, trombone; Bill Gemmer, trombone; Jim Pelz, trombone; Dominic Marino, trombone;  Rick Savage, trumpet; Tim Hagans, trumpet; Don Johnson, trumpet; Larry Wiseman, trumpet; Brad Dunn, trumpet; Al Kiger, trumpet; Al Nori, trumpet; Jerry Conrad, trumpet; Lynn Seaton, bass;  John Von Ohlen, drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Blue Wisp Big Band of Cincinnati (WKRC-TV Records, 1981)\nButterfly (Mopro, 1982)\nThe Smooth One (Mopro, 1983)\nLive at Carmelo's (Mopro, 1984)\nRollin' with Von Ohlen (Mopro, 1985)\n20th Anniversary (Sea Breeze, 2001)\nA Night at the Wisp (Sea Breeze, 2003)\nTribute (Sea Breeze, 2007)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Corporate Avenger was an American rap rock band from Southern California.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea for the band Corporate Avenger was born some time between 1995 and 1996 when brothers, Spike and Brad Xavier were on tour in the band Humble Gods. Years later, Spike met with Marco of 1605 Studio in Huntington Beach, California, and recorded some songs. In 1999, these songs were released on Suburban Noize Records as the Taxes are Stealing EP. This EP featured the first song ever recorded by the group, \"Evolve\", a song questioning the origins of the native peoples of the Americas.\nAt the time of the EP, the band consisted of eight members, including Pakelika of the Kottonmouth Kings, and members of 20 Dead Flower Children and No Doubt. During this phase of the band's history, the group had an ever-changing lineup and no two shows would be alike.\nIn 2000, the group released a CD titled The New Testament, which featured new songs as well as three songs from the previous EP. It also featured a new lineup including the first appearance of vocalist Adawee the Wind.\n2005 saw the release of the Born Again CD and also saw the departure of the Taxman.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nTaxes Are Stealing EP (2000)\nThe New Testament (2000)\nFreedom Is a State of Mind (2001)\nBorn Again (2005)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCorporate Avenger at AllMusic \nCorporate Avenger discography at MusicBrainz"

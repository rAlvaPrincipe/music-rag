    "text": "Sparkle Division is an American electronic music group composed of composers William Basinski, Preston Wendel, and Gary Thomas Wright.\n\n\n== History ==\nSparkle Division grew out of collaborations between ambient/electronic composer William Basinski and Preston Wendel, a recording engineer and composer whom Basinski had initially hired as a studio assistant. The pair collaborated on an electronic, saxophone-heavy album, which was completed in 2016 but not released until 2020. The album, To Feel Embraced, features Henry Grimes playing bass on one track. In 2023, a follow-up, Foxy, was announced, with the group continuing as a trio after adding Gary Thomas Wright as a member.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nTo Feel Embraced (Temporary Residence, 2020)\nClassified EP (Temporary Residence, 2021)\nFoxy (Temporary Residence, 2023)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Qkumba Zoo is a South African dance music duo from Johannesburg, South Africa, consisting of vocalist Levannah and musician/producer Owl. The band was originally formed by Owl and Levannah as a duo called Ocean Road.\nIn 1996 the band was a trio and consisted of Owl, Levannah, and dancer/sculptor Tziki. The band's 1996 song \"The Child (Inside)\" was a hit in the United States, reaching number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart.\n\n\n== BIG ==\nQkumba Zoo's first release was in 1995 titled BIG, and it was released in South Africa on Gresham Records. At the time, the band's name was spelled 'Qcumba Zoo', and even Tziki's name was the elongated 'Tsatsiki'. The booklet contained a colourful, busy design, featuring original artwork from Tziki, and pictures from Qcumba's stage shows. The title track on BIG has slightly different music and vocals from its subsequent release on Wake Up & Dream, and \"The Child (Inside)\" has a fading outro.\nTrack listing\n1. Rain (3:58)\n2.

Time of Wonder (5:18)\n11. Big – Mothership (4:15)\n\n\n== Wake Up and Dream ==\nQkumba Zoo's international debut, Wake Up & Dream, was released on Arista Records in 1996. As Levannah said, \"We wanted to form something that could be part of the global village. And, at the same time, have it be tied to its birthplace.\"\nTrack listing\n1. Rain (3:45)\n2. The Child (Inside) (3:58)\n3. Cloud Eyes (I'm Scared, You're Scared) (4:32)\n4. Flesh & Blood (4:03)\n5. Big (3:48)\n6. Into The Night (5:04)\n7. Weeping (5:06)\n8. Mermaids (4:46)\n9. Happy Earthday (3:42)\n10. Time of Wonder (5:14)\n11. Big Mothership (4:04)\nTheir first single, \"The Child (Inside),\" produced by the Berman Brothers, hit No. 1 on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1996, and No. 69 on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked on the Radio & Records contemporary hit radio charts at No. 34 on October 16, 1996. They were the first South African group to top the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart in over 17 years.\nThe 1996 Arista release of \"The Child (Inside)\" featured several mixes by DJ Junior Vasquez that became the standard for the song in American clubs. Vasquez followed up with several mixes of \"Cloud Eyes (I'm Scared You're Scared)\". In recent years, the original mix of \"The Child (Inside)\" has been used in several US television commercials, the most popular being from Seaworld parks and Carnival Cruise Lines.\nThe track \"Weeping\" was added to this release, the a cover of an anti-apartheid song by Bright Blue, another South African band. Bonus tracks are also provided on this album, including a musical remix of \"Mermaids\" and two stories/poems narrated by Levannah.\nIn August 1996, the group were the opening act for Danish singer Whigfield when she performed at the University of Port Elizabeth indoor sports centre.\n\n\n== Butterfly Peepl ==\nSeveral years after the release of the debut album, band member Tziki committed suicide in 1999. This was one of the catalysts that changed Owl and Levannah, which can be heard in the music of their second album, Butterfly Peepl, released in 2000. In addition to the album's release, the band's name was officially shortened from Qkumba Zoo to QZoo. The group also left Arista Records in favour of their own independent label, Zoocumba Music. The Butterfly Peepl release did not gain much attention, only having been for sale for a short time on QZoo's official site and released only in South Africa.\nTrack listing\n1. Beautiful (4:28)\n2.

The band still consisted of Owl and Levannah, who were now paired with a woman named Cajun. Lyrics for a new song, \"Strike Out Against the Tide\", appeared on the main page for a brief while, but soon the site disappeared.\nEventually, Owl resurfaced online and made it clear that he had not stopped making music, whether solo or paired with Levannah's voice. Tracks like \"Vision Afrika 2000\", \"These Visions\", \"Spider Girl\", and \"My Shepherd\" appeared for fans to stream/download.\nIn 2009, Qkumba Zoo released a new EP called N3X+, available for download on Rhythm Music Store's website.\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\nEarthbound\nTorn Between You and the Sky\nStrike Out Against the Tide\nKarmic Book\nLet the Light in\nTracks 2 and 5, while previously released on Butterfly Peepl, were remastered for N3X+. \"Earthbound\" was a song originally written while the band was still known as Ocean Road. Between Owl's solo work and N3X+, there is an apparent musical change from previous albums, which is now heading in the direction of traditional folk while continuing to integrate electronic/tribal sounds.\nIn late 2009, another official Qkumba Zoo site opened at Qkumbazoo.co.za, which contains a blog and other band info.\n\n\n== Letthelightin ==\nIn July 2011, Qkumba Zoo released an album with Souvenir Records called Letthelightin. The album contains re-mastered songs from their previous album Butterfly Peepl and songs from the N3X+  EP.\n\n\n== 2013-2022 ==\nOn 11 March 2013, it was announced that Qkumba Zoo was officially a side project, and Owl joined with Simone to create Owl and Simone.\nIn 2014 Qkumba Zoo's \"The Child Inside\" was listed as no. 60 on Sunday Times' \"100 Greatest South African Songs\".\nIn February 2019 Qkumba Zoo released the single \"Unicorns\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nQkumba Zoo Music Videos\nOwl on Reverb Nation\nLager Mentality: Zoologically Speaking\nQkumba Zoo discography at Discogs \nQkumba Zoo discography at MusicBrainz"

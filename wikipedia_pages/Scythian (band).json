    "text": "Scythian is a Celtic rock/Americana band based in the DC Metro Area that formed in 2002. The band's name, according to the members of Scythian, means \"[a] bunch of pre-Mesopotamian barbarians who did not use forks or phonics,\" which they chose to describe a varying sound that encompasses everything from traditional jigs and reels to contemporary covers. The band was named after Ukrainian nomads, Scythians, due to the Ukrainian ancestry of Alexander and Danylo Fedoryka. \nSince its inception, Scythian developed from a group of street performers in Alexandria, VA, to the 2009 winner of Washington City Paper's Best of DC 'Best Local Band' competition. In 2004 the band scored a brief appearance in the M. Night Shyamalan film The Village. The band has toured extensively on the East Coast. The UB Post describes their sound as a mix of Celtic, Klezmer, Gaelic, Gypsy and Rock.\nThe band currently comprises brothers Alexander Fedoryka (Violin/Mandolin/Harmonica/Bass/Vocals) and Danylo Fedoryka (Rhythm Guitar/Accordion/Vocals), as well as band members Ethan Dean (Bass/Percussion/Vocals) and Johnny Rees (Percussion/Drums/Vocals).\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\nAlexander Fedoryka: Vocals, Violin, Mandolin, Harmonica, Bass\nDanylo Fedoryka: Vocals, Rhythm Guitar, Accordion\nEthan Dean: Vocals, Percussion, Bass\nJohnny Rees: Drums, Percussion, Vocals\n\n\n=== Past band members ===\nFritz McGirr: Drums, Percussion, Vocals\nNolan Ladewski: Whistles, Flute, Vocals, Guitar, Banjo, Mandolin, Tenor Banjo\nLarissa Fedoryka: Vocals, Cello, Bass\nJosef Crosby: Vocals, Violin, Bass\nTim Hepburn: Drums, Percussion, Vocals\nAlexander Kuldell: Drums, Percussion\nMichael Ounallah: Vocals, Percussion, Drums, Banjo\nDanny Schneible: Drums, Percussion, Guitar, Lead Vocals\nAndrew Toy: Drums, Percussion, Vocals\nBen-David Warner: Banjo, Violin, Viola, Mandolin, Vocals, Guitar\n\n\n=== Josef Crosby's departure ===\nJosef Crosby stopped appearing with the band in May 2016, and Larissa Fedoryka took over on bass.

    "text": "Hunter Brothers is a Canadian country music group from Shaunavon, Saskatchewan composed of brothers Luke, J.J., Ty, Brock and Dusty Hunter. They signed with Open Road Recordings and released their debut single, \"El Dorado\", in February 2016. It debuted on the Billboard Canada Country chart in March 2016. The band earned their first Top 10 single at Canadian country radio with their hit \"Born and Raised\". In 2019, their single \"Lost\" became their first #1 hit.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nThe Hunter Brothers are a Canadian country band consisting of 5 brothers from Shaunavon, Saskatchewan: Luke, J.J., Ty, Brock, and Dusty. Their parents are Lorne and Norma Hunter, and their uncle Jim Hunter is a Canadian Olympic skier.\nThese brothers grew up farming in the Canadian prairies. They spent their summers singing in churches across the country. In the Winter, they were heavily involved in the hockey community. Some of the brothers even played for some major league teams.\nWhen the 5 brothers are at home working on the farm, they often pass the time in the field by re-writing well known songs with words that are relevant to farming culture, performing them over their CB radios. They often share these songs online through their various social media platforms.\n\n\n== Hockey Careers ==\nFour of the five brothers played junior ice hockey and three played in the professional minor leagues. J.J., Dustin, and Luke each played forward, while Brock and Ty were defencemen. Ty played rep hockey before suffering a broken femur. The remaining four brothers all sustained injuries of various kinds and returned home to continue farming with their parents on their family's 20,000 acre farm.\nJ.J. Hunter played three seasons in Western Hockey League with the Kelowna Rockets and Prince Albert Raiders; he attended six NHL training camps (1999 Detroit Red Wings, 2001-2006 Edmonton Oilers) and was under contract with the Edmonton Oilers for 5 seasons playing NHL pre-season games and five years in their farm system. Altogether, he played 6 years of pro-hockey including parts of six seasons in the American Hockey League with the Hamilton Bulldogs, Toronto Roadrunners, Edmonton Road Runners, Toronto Marlies and Manitoba Moose; and parts of four season in the ECHL with the Toledo Storm and Columbus Cottonmouths.\nDustin Hunter played junior hockey with the Melville Millionaires in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, then one professional season split between the Oklahoma City Blazers and San Angelo Saints in the Central Hockey League before his career was abruptly ended due to a severe eye injury.\nLuke Hunter played five seasons in the WHL with the Swift Current Broncos, and one season each with the Wichita Thunder in the CHL, and the University of Calgary Dinos men's ice hockey team in the CIS. His career also came to a halt due to an eye injury.\nBrock Hunter played junior hockey in the AJHL with the Drumheller Dragons, and the Fort McMurray Oil Barons before finishing up his career with the Kindersley Klippers in the SJHL.\nAll the brothers joined forces together when they returned home to play for the same hometown hockey team, the Shaunavon Badgers in the WMHL.\n\n\n== Music career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nMusic has always brought these 5 brothers together. When they were younger, they spent their time mirroring music videos from other artists, and learning to become performers. What emerged was an organic pop-country sound. The Hunter Brothers quickly became known for their harmonies and stage presence.\n\n\n=== 2016–2018: Getaway ===\nIn 2016, the brothers started recording a collection of songs with their label Open Road Recordings. On February 5, 2016 they released their debut single “El Dorado” to country radio which helped put this new band on the map within the Canadian country music industry. \"El Dorado\" was co-produced by Brad Rempel of Canadian country band High Valley along with Seth Mosley and Mike \"X\" O'Connor\n“El Dorado” debuted on the Billboard Canada Country charts in March 2016, and reach number 24 on the chart.\nIn the Spring of 2017, the Hunter Brothers released their debut album Getaway.

Within a week of first playing together, they were playing shows, and a year later recorded their first EP. Birdcloud developed a signature playing style in which the two women face each other rather than their audience, as described by Kaset: \"It’s less about excluding other people than doing what it takes to become Birdcloud.\"\nAfter a tour of Australia in October 2018, the group went silent on official social media channels and then later canceled its remaining shows for the year.\nOn July 1, 2019, Makenzie Green posted on Instagram that she was seeking an opportunity to resume her musical career outside of Birdcloud.\nOn Jan. 20, 2020, the band reactivated social media accounts and stated it was back.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn response to their songs \"Indianer\" and \"Black Guys\", Birdcloud has received death threats  and calls for boycott.

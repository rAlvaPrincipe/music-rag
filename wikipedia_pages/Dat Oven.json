    "text": "Dat Oven is a dance/electronica duo based in New York City. The act consists of Jeffery Gratton (from Worcester, Massachusetts) and Shunji Moriwaki (from Oita, Japan).\nThe act has had three entries on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart:\n\n1998 \"Chelsea Press 2\" (#1)\n1998 \"Icy Lake\" (#18)\n1998 \"Jet Set\" (#9)\nThe name \"Dat Oven\" refers to new ideas arising from friction, for example the clash of opinions that a creative duo might impose on each other; or the conflict between art and commerce. Friction generates heat; heat comes from the \"Oven\"; D.igital A.udio T.echnology is Dat Oven's medium (DAT).\nIn 2014, sister labels Night Slugs (UK) and Fade to Mind (US) put out a joint re-release of \"Icy Lake\", including several remixes by artists on both labels. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one dance hits (United States)\nList of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chart\n\n\n== External links ==\nReview of \"Icy Lake\" from Billboard Magazine (January 17, 1998)\nReview of \"Chelsea Press 2\" from Billboard Magazine (October 18, 1997)\n\n\n== References =="

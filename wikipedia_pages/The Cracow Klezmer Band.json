    "text": "The Cracow Klezmer Band was a Polish jazz quartet formed by accordionist and composer Jarosław Bester in 1997 in the city of Kraków, and recorded for Tzadik Records. The group performed at Jewish Culture festivals in Hungary, Finland, Poland, Prague, and the Czech Republic. Its sound was different from what most people would consider to be traditional klezmer music — instead of danceable versions of traditional Yiddish songs, and free-form fantasies, and laments, The Cracow Klezmer Band played often dark and brooding but soulful and dynamic original virtuoso compositions instead in the klezmer form.  Some songs could be considered dance pieces, but there were none of the traditional Bulgars, Freylekhs or Horas.\nThey also imitated non-musical sounds using their instruments, for example the sound of a creaking ship or a distant crying bird; this actually has a long tradition in klezmer music.\nIn January 2007, the band changed its name to the Bester Quartet, with the same line-up.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe Cracow Klezmer Band consisted of four members:\n\nJarosław Bester – accordion\nJarosław Tyrala – violin\nOleg Dyyak – accordion, clarinet and percussion\nWojciech Front – double bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Band released albums on John Zorn's Tzadik record label, with its mandate of \"Radical Jewish Culture.\"\n\n\n=== The Cracow Klezmer Band ===\nDe Profundis (2000)\nThe Warriors (2001)\nVoices in the Wilderness (2003) - Crakow Klezmer Band perform one track\nBereshit (2003)\nSanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass (2005)\nBalan: Book of Angels Volume 5 (2006)\nRemembrance (2007)\n\n\n=== Bester Quartet ===\nMetamorphoses (2012)\nThe Golden Land (2013)\nKrakoff (2013)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCulture of Kraków\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Cracow Klezmer Band discography at Discogs\nBester Quartet's Homepage\nAlbum reviews in All About Jazz"

    "text": "Tarentel is a post-rock band which formed in San Francisco in 1995. Initially, the band consisted of Danny Grody and Jefre Cantu-Ledesma. The line-up altered over the years and has included John Hughes, Trevor Montgomery, Patricia Kavanaugh, Kenseth Thibideau, Jeffrey Rosenberg, Jim Redd, Tony Cross, Steve Dye and others.\nTarentel began as a post-rock band, making extended, LP-side length instrumental pieces. Over the course of three full-length albums and a number of singles and EPs, Tarentel has gradually shifted its style to a looser, more improvisational form that incorporates genres such as noise and drone as well as having a strong psychedelic element.\nTarentel member, Paul Clipson, projects original Super-8 film compositions that accompany each live performance by the band. He died in February 2018. The band has been inactive at least since their most recent release in 2009.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nFrom Bone to Satellite (1999) (limited to 1000 copies)\nThe Order of Things (2001) (vinyl limited to 500 copies)\nMort aux Vaches (2002) (limited to 1000 copies)\nWe Move Through Weather (2004)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nTarentel (1998)\nTravels in Constants vol. 3 (1999) (limited to 1000 copies) (part of the Travels in Constants series)\nWhen We Almost Killed Ourselves (1999) (limited to 200 copies)\nLooking for Things / Searching for Things (2000) (limited to 500 copies)\nTwo Sides of Myself (2000) (limited to 500 copies)\nCarol Whiskey 9 (2000) (limited to 250 copies) (split with Rothko)\nSets and Rises / Rises and Sets (2000) (limited to 500 copies) (split with Lilienthal)\nFear of Bridges (2002) (limited. to 700 copies)\nLatency (2003) (limited to 100 copies)\nPaper White (2005)\nBig Black Square (2005)\nGhost Weight (2005)\nPaper White / Big Black Square (2005)\nHome Ruckus (2005) (limited to 500 copies)\nHome Ruckus: Double-Sided Air (2007) (limited to 500 copies)\nHome Ruckus: Bottled Smoke (2007) (limited to 100 copies)\nGhetto Beats On the Surface of the Sun (2007)\nYou Can't Hide Your Love Forever Vol. 3: Space Junk (2009) (limited to 300 copies, part of the You Can't Hide Your Love Forever 7-inch subscription series)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nEphemera | Singles 99-00 (2002)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nLive Edits: Natoma CD (2006) (limited to 500 copies)\nGhetto Beats On the Surface of the Sun (2006) (limited to 500 copies of each)\nLive Edits: Italy & Switzerland (2008) (limited to 500 copies)\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\nOver Water (2009) (DVD-r collaboration with filmmaker Paul Clipson, three shorts of Super8 film and music mostly culled from live performances in Italy & Switzerland in 2005, limited to 100 copies)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Micky & the Motorcars is a Red Dirt band formed in Stanley, Idaho, now based in Austin, Texas. They have released nine albums, including two live albums.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe two founding members, Micky and Gary Braun, are the sons of outlaw country and western swing musician Muzzie Braun of Stanley, Idaho, and the brothers of Cody Braun and Willy Braun of the Texas-based roots rock band Reckless Kelly. Both were part of Muzzie Braun & the Little Braun Brothers band, but formed their own band after Cody and Willy left to form Reckless Kelly. \nThe band originated in Idaho. The other founding members were childhood friends Travis Hardy on drums and Mark McCoy on bass. They moved to Austin, Texas, where Joseph Deeb joined the band as their lead guitarist. The band has undergone a number of personnel changes since its founding. Mark McCoy left the band in 2011 and died in 2012 in a rafting accident. \nThe band currently consists of Micky Braun (acoustic guitar, lead vocals), Gary Braun (lead & harmony vocals, guitars, mandolin, harmonica), Pablo Trujillo (lead guitar, pedal steel), Andrew Carrell (bass), and Bobby Paugh (drums & percussion).\nThe band is also tied to the Texas music movement and, to a lesser extent, the Oklahoma-based Red Dirt music scene. Every year, the band, in conjunction with their brothers and fellow musicians in Reckless Kelly, host the Braun Brothers Reunion in Idaho to celebrate the music and different artists from the genre.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBand website\nMicky & the Motorcars discography at Discogs"

    "text": "Ekko Astral are a punk rock band based in Washington, D.C. The group play a blend of noise rock and pop-punk, referred to by the band as \"mascara mosh pit\". Their first album, Pink Balloons, was released on Topshelf Records in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nEkko Astral started in 2021, after longtime friends Jael Holzman and Liam Hughes reconnected following  Hughes moving to Washington, D.C. in 2021. The pair previously wrote music together while they attended the University of Vermont but disbanded post graduation. Their debut EP, Quartz, was recorded for Hughes' master's thesis at American University, where he was studying audio technology. Before the recording of Quartz, Holzman came out as a trans woman. In recording the EP, Holzman wanted to provide an outlet for expressing the emotions she felt coming to terms with her transgender identity during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBassist and percussionist Miri Tyler was recruited from Washington, D.C.'s DIY music scene for the recording of Quartz. Following the recording and release of Quartz, Tyler was made the group's full-time drummer, and was joined by fellow trans D.C. indie musician Guinevere Tully on bass. The band's lineup was finalized with the addition of rhythm guitarist Sam Elmore, a childhood friend of Holzman's. The group's first release as a quintet was the live EP The Quartz Farewell, recorded at Comet Ping Pong in 2023.\nEkko Astral announced their signing to Topshelf Records in 2024; their full-length debut Pink Balloons was released through the label on April 17th. Its release was preceded by that of singles \"Baethoven\", \"Devorah\", and \"On Brand\", which received enthusiastic profiles in outlets including NPR and Stereogum. Stereogum also included Ekko Astral in their annual list of \"The 40 Best New Artists\" for 2024. Pitchfork ranked the album No. 1 on its list of \"The 30 Best Rock Albums of 2024.\"\nIn 2024, it was announced the group would be supporting Idles on tour for three dates in the Southern United States, as well as opening for Ted Leo and the Pharmacists on the first leg of their Shake the Sheets 20th anniversary tour. As of May 2024, the band are working on their next release, \"a concept album about the Beltway\".\nIn July 2024, Tully left the group to focus on her solo project, Rosslyn Station. Holzman became the group's bass player in her absence. Elmore announced his departure 2 months later on September 4.\n\n\n== Style and influences ==\nEkko Astral's name was derived from a lyric in the Death Grips song \"Come Up And Get Me\", the opening track from their album No Love Deep Web.\nThe group uses the genre label of \"mascara moshpit\" music as a descriptor of both their musical style as well as the queer and countercultural leanings of their music. While the group intended Quartz to be explicitly about the experience of being transgender, Pink Balloons features a more expanded focus. Tully describes their music as \"for [trans women], but not just for [trans women]\"; while Holzman says their primary audience for their music is those \"who are struggling, who are at their absolute lowest\".\nDescribing the band's sound in opposition to those of other punk influences, Holzman has said that Ekko Astral is \"just Charli XCX and Sophie with loud guitars\". The lyrics of Pink Balloons have been compared to those of Arctic Monkeys; Holzman has named their album Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino as an influence. Ekko Astral has also drawn influence from Jeff Rosenstock, Kendrick Lamar, Ethel Cain, Gilla Band, Idles, and Ditz, alongside other trans-fronted punk acts such as Lambrini Girls, Crush Fund, and Anita Velveeta.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\n\nJael Holzman (2021-present) - vocals, bass guitar (2024-present)\nLiam Hughes (2021-present) - lead guitar, keys\nMiri Tyler (2021-present) - drums, percussion, bass guitar (2021-2022)\nPast members\n\nStephen Yaeger (2021-2022) - drums\nGuinevere Tully (2022-2024) - bass guitar\nSam Elmore (2022-2024) - rhythm guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nPink Balloons (2024)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nStudio\n\nQuartz (2022)\nLive\n\nThe Quartz Farewell (2023)\n\n\n== Works cited ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEkko Astral on Bandcamp\nEkko Astral on Topshelf Records"

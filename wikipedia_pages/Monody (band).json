He started with piano lessons as a child and on to the electric guitar as a teenager.  He was a member of a couple rock bands over the years, but his true passion comes from building on his home studio and becoming a skilled engineer and producer of his own and other musicians' projects.  His ongoing side project, Entium, occasionally releases tracks that are on the electronica side of things. Geoff's vocal influences include artists like Dave Gahan, Jean-Luc De Meyer and Peter Murphy.\n\n\n=== David Battrick ===\nDavid has been a long-standing fixture in the Portland, Oregon music scene. He has been a past member of Monochrome, Written in Ashes, and Pharrah Phosphate. Notably, David spent 3 years studying percussion under the tutelage of Roger Allen (of the Portland Philharmonic fame).\n\n\n=== Daniel Edgar ===\nDaniel spent much of his early days growing up in a small Oregon town tinkering with drums, various noisemaking electronics, synthesizers and samplers. From an early age, he was inspired by European synthpop, 80s post-punk, and industrial music. Before Monody, Daniel spent time in several bands playing keyboards, bass, drums and most recently guitar.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nOf Iron and Clay LP (April 2011)\nOf Iron and Clay: Voiceless (Instrumental) LP (April 2021)\nSubtle Dissent EP (November 2022)\nA Safe Place EP (December 2023)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nBound (February 2008)\nCeti Lullaby (February 2008)\nAbsent (February 2008)\nIn Between (February 2008)\nThanks to You (September 2008)\nThe Crime (September 2008)\nDisremembered (September 2008)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nThe Highest Cost (Monodized) by Son of Rust on re:Cycled (May 2009)\nÜber's Wasser Gehen (Monody Remix) by Obscenity Trial on Über's Wasser Gehen single (Special Edition) (July 2009)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Monody Site\nMonody on Ultimate Band List"

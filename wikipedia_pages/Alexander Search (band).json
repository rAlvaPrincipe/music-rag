    "text": "Alexander Search is an English language Portuguese indie pop / indie rock band, formed in Lisbon, by pianist Júlio Resende and singer Salvador Sobral in late-2016.\n\"Alexander Search\" was one of the many heteronyms used by 20th Century Portuguese author Fernando Pessoa. Search, a literary persona/pseudonym created by the author during his teenage years, wrote mainly in English (Pessoa would later switch to writing exclusively in his native Portuguese language).\nThe band pays tribute to the work of Fernando Pessoa by adopting his pseudonym's name and playing original indie pop/rock songs built around his poetry. Also in the same spirit, each of the band's members adopted pseudonyms.\nAlexander Search's self-titled debut album was released in June 2017, peaking at number 3 in the Portuguese charts.\n\n\n== Members ==\nSalvador Sobral, \"Benjamin Cymbra\" – vocals (2016–2020)\nJúlio Resende, \"Augustus Search\" – keyboards, piano (2016–present)\nDaniel Neto, \"Marvel K.\" – electric guitar (2016–present)\nAndré Nascimento, \"Sgt.

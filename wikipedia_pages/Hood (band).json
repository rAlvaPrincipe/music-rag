    "text": "Hood are an English post-rock band from Wetherby, formed in 1990, but have been on an indefinite hiatus since 2005. The band consists of brothers Chris and Richard Adams, and friends (including, at times, Craig Tattersall and Andrew Johnson of The Remote Viewer, and Nicola Hodgkinson of Empress).\n\n\n== History ==\nHood's first releases were very limited vinyl singles on various small independent record labels.\nIn 1994, record labels Fluff and Slumberland Records released Hood's first full length album, Cabled Linear Traction.  Slumberland also released 1996's Silent '88, and the following year Happy Go Lucky Records released Structured Disasters, a compilation of tracks from singles.  All featured a large number of short tracks (many of less than a minute), a mixture of indie rock, noise experiments reminiscent of Sonic Youth or Pavement, and an increasing interest in electronics.\nIn 1997, Domino Records signed Hood and released the single \"Useless\".  Produced by Matt Elliott (better known as the Third Eye Foundation), it was a far more straightforward and tuneful song than any they had released so far.  Elliott toured with the band, and produced the albums Rustic Houses, Forlorn Valleys and The Cycle of Days and Seasons.  Like the single, these abandoned the short songs and instrumental snippets for longer pieces, with a pastoral sound similar to Bark Psychosis or Talk Talk.  The band continued to release singles for other labels; \"The Weight\", for 555 Recordings, was a return to the older style with eight tracks on a 7\" disc.\nCollaborating with friends Doseone and Why? from the Anticon collective, Hood released their fifth album, Cold House in 2001.  The work combined elements of post-rock, IDM, and indie with Doseone and Why?'s lyrical talents and featured the single \"You Show No Emotion At All\".\nIn 2003, most of the band's single and compilation tracks from the years since Structured Disasters were collected on  Singles Compiled (a double CD), and Compilations 1995-2002.  Neither contains any of the tracks recorded for Domino, but some unreleased material is included on the singles collection.\nIn early 2005, after additional line-up changes, Hood released Outside Closer. The tracks 'The Lost You' and 'The Negatives' were released as singles.\nSince the release of Outside Closer, Hood has toured with Why? promoting his album Elephant Eyelash and released various remixes: including 'The Negatives' with vocals by British MC Jehst. Chris also has a solo side project called Bracken, and in 2007 released the album We Know About the Need on Anticon.\nIn 2007 Richard Adams formed a side project The Declining Winter, releasing a 7\" single, The Future Sound of Hip Hop parts 1 & 2, and an album Goodbye Minnesota and further albums on a variety of labels. \nIn 2012, Domino Records released a six disc compilation box set called Recollected to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the release of Cold House.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nCabled Linear Traction (1994)\nSilent '88 (1996)\nRustic Houses, Forlorn Valleys (1998)\nThe Cycle of Days and Seasons (1999)\nCold House (2001)\nOutside Closer (2005)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nStructured Disasters (1997)\nCompilations 1995-2002 (2003)\nSingles Compiled (2003)\nRecollected (six CD box set) (2012)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Sirens\" (1992)\n\"Opening into Enclosure\" (1993)\n\"57 White Bread\" (1994)\n\"Carmine\" (split) (1995)\n\"A Harbour of Thoughts\" (1995)\n\"Hem\" (split) (1995)\n\"Lee Faust's Million Piece Orchestra\" (1995)\n\"I've Forgotten How to Live\" (1996)\n\"Secrets Now Known to Others\" (Earworm Records, 1996)\n\"Useless\"' (1997)\n\"Filmed Initiative\" (1998)\n\"The Year of Occasional Lull\" (1998)\n\"(The) Weight\" (1998)\n\"Steward\" (split) (2000)\n\"Home is Where it Hurts\" (2001)\n\"Photographers\" (2001)\n\"You Show No Emotion at All\" (2002)\n\"Themselves\" (split) (2004)\n\"The Lost You\" (2004)\n\"The Negatives\" (2005)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (via archive.org)\nBBC interview\nLabel site\nForum"

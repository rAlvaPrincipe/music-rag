    "text": "The Ditty Bops were an American band from Los Angeles, California that began with Warner Brothers, and later self-produced recordings. Noted for their tight vocal harmonies by Abby DeWald and Amanda Barrett, they incorporated a variety of musical styles such as folk, bluegrass, blues, western swing, ragtime and musical theater with guitar, ukulele, mandolin and dulcimer. Their live shows were often very interactive, and had different themes and theatrical elements complete with props, costumes, skits, and amusing slide shows.\n\n\n== History ==\nRomantically involved since 1999, DeWald and Barrett met in New York City and formed The Ditty Bops years later after a hunt for a neighbor's lost cat. When they unwittingly crossed into the backyard of a stranger, they discovered that he was a musician and an avid guitar collector. He encouraged them to form a band and start playing.\nTheir music has been on the ABC show Grey's Anatomy, including \"There's a Girl,\" which is featured on the show's soundtrack CD. The band has also appeared on The L Word.\nThe Ditty Bops appeared twice on Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor: May 7, 2005 from Mitchell, South Dakota and June 18, 2005, from Highland Park, Illinois.\nFrom May 23 through September 2, 2006, the Ditty Bops embarked on a cross-country tour by bicycle to promote the release of their second album, Moon Over the Freeway, while advocating a call-to-action about pollution and energy conservation. They traveled from Los Angeles to New York City, logging 4,502.75 miles.\nIn October 2008, Abby and Amanda announced their marriage in California via an e-mail message to their fans and MySpace Blog.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Ditty Bops (CD) – Warner Bros.

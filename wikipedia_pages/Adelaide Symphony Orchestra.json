    "text": "The Adelaide Symphony Orchestra (ASO) is a South Australian orchestra based in Adelaide, established in 1936. The orchestra's primary performance venue is the Adelaide Town Hall, but the ASO also performs in other venues. It provides the orchestral support for all productions of the State Opera of South Australia and all Adelaide performances of the Australian Ballet. It also features regularly at the Adelaide Festival, and has performed at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival, WOMAdelaide and several other festivals in Adelaide.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1936 the South Australian Orchestra was supplanted by the 50-member Adelaide Symphony Orchestra led by William Cade, and sponsored by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (later the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, or ABC). The orchestra reformed in 1949 as the 55-member South Australian Symphony Orchestra, with Henry Krips as its resident conductor. The orchestra reverted to its original title, the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, in late 1975.\nThe ASO's highlights have included its 1998 performances of Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle, the first Australian production since 1913 (although it was widely and erroneously claimed to be the first ever in Australia).\nThe orchestra participated in the first fully Australian production of The Ring in 2004.\nIn 2007, the orchestra partnered with Hilltop Hoods to prepare a re-orchestrated release of their album The Hard Road, titled The Hard Road: Restrung.\nIn 2009 Premier and Arts Minister Mike Rann proposed and provided government funding to the ASO to commission a major orchestral work about climate change. The ASO's world premiere of Gerard Brophy's The Blue Thread, inspired by the River Murray, was performed at the Concert for the Earth at the Adelaide Town Hall on 27 November 2010. The Rann government proposed and arranged funding for two further ASO commissions, the first an orchestral tribute to the cricketer Sir Donald Bradman, and the second commemorating the centenary of the ANZAC landings at Gallipoli. The world premiere of Our Don by Natalie Williams was performed by the ASO in August 2014.\nThe world premiere of an ANZAC Requiem by composer Iain Grandage and librettist Kate Mulvany was performed on 22 April 2015.\nIn 2015 the Hilltop Hoods collaborated for a second time with the 32-piece Adelaide Symphony Orchestra and the 20-piece Adelaide Chamber Singers Choir for their next re-orchestrated album titled Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung.\nIn 2016, the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra formed its first artistic leadership team, comprising principal conductor, Nicholas Carter, its new artist-in-association, violinist Pinchas Zukerman, and principal guest conductor and artistic advisor Sir Jeffrey Tate. Carter was the youngest principal conductor in the orchestra's history, and the first Australian conductor to be appointed to a principal conductor position with a major Australian orchestra in almost 30 years. Carter completed his term as principal conductor in 2019.\nIn 2017, the orchestra was central in the Adelaide Festival's staging of Barrie Kosky's Saul – a production from Glyndebourne Opera in the UK, and again in 2018 for the Adelaide Festival's Glyndebourne Opera production and Australian premiere of composer Brett Dean's new opera, Hamlet. These performances were received with critical acclaim and numerous Helpmann Awards.\nIn 2018, the artistic leadership team evolved to include the orchestra's new emerging artist-in-association, Grace Clifford; Australian composer and the orchestra's new composer-in-association, Cathy Milliken; and the orchestra's new principal guest conductor, Mark Wigglesworth. As of 2024, the artistic leadership team consists of Concertmaster Kate Suthers, Artist in Association Emily Sun, Emerging Composer in Association Jakub Jankowski, Conductor Laureate, Nicholas Braithwaite, and the orchestra consists of 75 musicians.\nIn May 2024, the orchestra announced the appointment of Mark Wigglesworth as its next chief conductor, effective January 2025, with an initial contract of three years.\n\n\n== Venues and ongoing work ==\nThe orchestra's primary performance venue is the Adelaide Town Hall, but the ASO also performs in other venues such as the Adelaide Festival Centre, Adelaide Entertainment Centre, Elder Hall at the University of Adelaide and its own Grainger Studio (named after composer Percy Grainger).\nThe ASO provides the orchestral support for all productions of the State Opera of South Australia, as well as the Adelaide performances of The Australian Ballet. The orchestra is a regularly featured ensemble at the Adelaide Festival, and also appears as part of the Adelaide Cabaret Festival, OzAsia Festival, Adelaide Guitar Festival and WOMADelaide.\n\n\n== Recognition, awards and international tours ==\n1996 – Tour to China (Beijing, Jinan, Qingdao and Shanghai), Korea (Seoul, Daegu) and Singapore\n1998 – State Opera of South Australia's production of Wagner's Ring Cycle; repeated in 2004 with the first all-Australian production\n2004 – Helpmann Award Finalist for Best Classical Concert Presentation – Requiem & The Grainger Special 2003\n2004 – Helpmann Award for Best Opera – Dead Man Walking, State Opera SA 2003\n2005 – Helpmann Award Winner for Best Opera – The Ring Cycle, State Opera SA 2004\n2006 – 2013 Mahler Symphony Cycle\n2007 – recorded The Hard Road Restrung with hip hop band the Hilltop Hoods – went gold (sold over 35,000 units); awarded 2007 ARIA Award for Best Urban Release\n2008 – Helpmann Awards Finalist for Best Classical Concert Presentation – Sibelius Festival\n2009 – Tour to Carnegie Hall, New York as part of the G'Day USA celebrations\n2010 – Sibelius Symphony Cycle\n2012 – Helpmann Award Finalist for Best Symphony Concert – Master Series 3 – Fire Series\n2013 – APRA/Australian Music Centre's Arts Award for Excellence in Music Education – Australian Emerging Composers Creative Workshop with Tan Dun and six young Australian composers\n2016 – Arts South Australia Ruby Award for Sustained Contribution by an Organisation\n2017 – Helpmann Award for Best Opera – Saul, Adelaide Festival 2016\n2017 – The Bush Concert (ASO commissioned work) toured to Harbin for the 34th China Harbin Summer Music Festival\n2019 – winner of Best Independent Classical Album in the AIR Independent Music Awards for Bach Concertos, along with the Grigoryan Brothers and Benjamin Northey.\n\n\n=== ARIA Music Awards ===\n\n\n== Principal conductors ==\nWilliam Cade (resident conductor, 1939)\nBernard Heinze (guest conductor, 1939)\nPercy Code (interim resident conductor, 1949)\nHenry Krips (resident conductor, 1949–1972)\nElyakum Shapirra (chief conductor, 1975–1979)\nJosé Serebrier (principal guest conductor, 1982–1983)\nPiero Gamba (chief conductor, 1983–1985)\nAlbert Rosen (chief conductor, 1986)\nNicholas Braithwaite (chief conductor, 1987–1991)\nDavid Porcelijn (chief conductor, 1993–1998)\nArvo Volmer (chief conductor, 2004–2013)\nNicholas Carter (2015–2019)\nMark Wigglesworth (designate, effective January 2025)\n\n\n== See also ==\nSymphony Services International\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Kaze, also known as Killa Klan Kaze, is an American hip hop group from Memphis, Tennessee. They are largely known for their affiliation with Three 6 Mafia throughout much of the 1990s, having been a featured act and members of the Prophet Posse and Hypnotize Camp Posse. The group originally consisted of M.C Mack, Scan Man and K-Rock, though Project Pat replaced K-Rock in the trio for the group's debut album, 1998's Kamakaze Timez Up, produced by DJ Paul and Juicy J. \nIn 2000, the group's affiliation with Three 6 Mafia ended when M.C. Mack and Scan Man had a fallout with DJ Paul and Juicy J after attempting to release music independently produced and recorded under The Kaze name, with a lengthy dispute over royalties resulting. Since that time, The Kaze has operated independently, having undergone membership growth and changes, while releasing several albums via its label, Kami Kaze Productions.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Kaze began their activities in the early 1990s in Memphis. In 1995, the group (then known as \"Killa Klan Kaze\") was featured on a tape entitled \"Volume 3 Spring Mix 95\", which contained the first recorded track of Killa Klan Kaze, \"Runnin 'Lip\". They had a track on Three 6 Mafia's 1995 EP Live by Yo Rep, titled \"Be a Witness\". Project Pat ultimately replaced K-Rock and in 1998 the group released their first studio album Kamakaze Timez Up and sold about 50,000 independent copies. The album was released with the production of Three 6 Mafia's Juicy J and DJ Paul. The album would be the only project released by the group together. 1998, the group's label, Prophet Entertainment shut down after label co-founders DJ Paul and Juicy J split from fellow label co-founder Nick Scarfo. The result was DJ Paul and Juicy J's creation of a new label, Hypnotize Minds. In, 1999 Scan Man and M.C. Mack founded their own Kami Kaze Inc. independent label and released Thugz From Southside: 2000 Mazdestruction.\nIn 2012, the group was nominated for music awards at the Memphis Music Hall of Fame and won the \"Best Group\" Award.\nIn 2020, MC Mack filed a copyright lawsuit against Three 6 Mafia, alleging that they have been using their music without permission since the 1990s. The case is pending in court in Shelby County, Tennessee.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nKamakazie Timez Up (1998)\nKami Kaze (2001)\nOnly the Strong Survive (2005)\nKKZ Timez Up: Part 2 (2022)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References =="

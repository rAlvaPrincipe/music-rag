    "text": "\"Afternoons & Coffeespoons\" is a song by Canadian rock band Crash Test Dummies, released by Arista in June 1994 as the third single from the band's 1993 album God Shuffled His Feet. \"Afternoons & Coffeespoons\" has been called the band's most popular song amongst fans. It is also one of their most successful songs commercially, peaking at number two in Iceland, number seven in Canada, number 16 in Finland, and number 66 in the United States.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe title and lyrics of the song reference the 1915 T. S. Eliot poem \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\". Lead vocalist Brad Roberts called it \"a song about being afraid of getting old, which is a reflection of my very neurotic character\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nLarry Flick of Billboard called \"Afternoons & Coffeespoon\" \"another winner\" for the band, writing that although it did not live up to the catchiness of \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\", it was a \"very hummable\" song. Emma Cochrane from Smash Hits gave it three out of five, writing, \"Unfortunately this single hasn't got a great hook like \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\". Radio One love them because they fit into their new adult rock sound.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for \"Afternoons & Coffeespoons\" features Brad Roberts as a patient in a hospital, with the rest of the band playing the doctors operating on him. A bored Grim reaper passes the time smoking, talking on his cellphone and watching the other patients as he waits for him to expire.\nThe video ends with Roberts getting discharged, with a choreographed wheelchair dance on the hospital helipad.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References =="

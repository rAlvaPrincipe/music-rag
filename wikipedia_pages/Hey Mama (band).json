    "text": "Hey Mama was a contemporary rock band from Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band Hey Mama stemmed from the folk-rock duo Avi & Celia. Avi Salloway and Celia Woodsmith teamed up Ben Kogan and Jared Seabrook to form Hey Mama in January 2009.  The debut album, Hey Mama, was released on December 1, 2009. Hey Mama was recorded with Grammy Award nominated producer Jack Gauthier. The record also featured guest appearances from The Tecumseh Strings, a chamber group of Boston string players.\nHey Mama was known for their high-energy performances. The electrified sound blends new and old with Woodsmith's wailing on the washboard. The Boston Globe calls it, \"Sexy roots swagger with populist fire.\" The band has played over 400 shows throughout the United States and Canada,  building a loyal fan base and has received praise from Yankee, the Boston Globe, and NHPR.\nHey Mama has played several concerts supporting Taj Mahal, Leon Russell and Big Brother and the Holding Company.\n\n\n== Former members ==\nAvi Salloway\nCelia Woodsmith\nJared Seabrook\nPaul Chase\nBen Kogan, 2009\n\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nAvi Salloway; Acoustic Guitar and Electric guitar, Harmonica, Vocals\nCelia Woodsmith; Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Washboard\nJared Seabrook; Drums\nPaul Chase; Electric Bass and Double Bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHey Mama (2009)\nLet It Rise (2008)\nOff the Floor (2007)\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Boston Globe\nSeven Days VT\nYankee Magazine\nState of Mind Magazine\nRavings of a Mad Music Man Archived 2011-07-08 at the Wayback Machine\npH Balanced\nTea Party Boston\nWERS, Emerson College\nRyans Smashing Life\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nMyspace"

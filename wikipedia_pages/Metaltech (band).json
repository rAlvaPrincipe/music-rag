    "text": "Metaltech (met'l tek) are a three piece Scottish metal/techno/rock/industrial dance music band from Edinburgh. They consist of Erik Tricity (Erik Grieve) performing vocals, rhythm guitar, programming and production, Lord Thrapston Flagellator, pronounced fla-jella-tor (Emmett Christie) playing bass guitar and the Insidious Doktor Mayhem (Rory Alsop) providing lead guitar and pyrotechnics.\nTheir music is an amalgamation of rock/metal guitars, funk/slap bass, synthesizers, techno inspired programmed drums and tongue-in-cheek lyrics.\nMetaltech are renowned for their theatrical performances and over the top behaviour, with band members donning masks, Kabuki style make up and eccentric costumes, all themed in neon orange, black and white. Their stage show involves frequent audience interaction with items such as glo-sticks and party poppers being thrown into the crowd, as well as the use of bubble guns, confetti cannons and fireworks.\n\n\n== History: Band formation ==\nMetaltech formed in January 2009 and played their first gig at the Ark in Edinburgh on 1 February 2009. After a few small gigs, the band was then offered a support slot with Alec Empire of Atari Teenage Riot that resulted in increased recognition. After using their strong image to stand out in a nationwide television advertising campaign for T-Mobile, they landed gigs at Rockness, The Wickerman Festival and Belladrum, three Scottish music festivals.\nIn 2011, they came second in the running in the Best Metal category at the Scottish Alternative Music Awards, and were nominated and played live at the Scottish New Music Awards. Having released two EPs and working around Scotland including a mini tour with Japanese band Psydoll, the band went on to perform in London at the fetish venue, Club Antichrist. This performance introduced additional performers in the shape of the Kamikaze Girls, who, dressed as latex sex dolls pole danced during the song Sex on the Dancefloor. Metaltech then provided support for Angelspit at The Classic Grand in Glasgow. Later supporting KMFDM, Metaltech were also the opening act at the Infest (festival) in 2013. The beginning of 2014 saw the band tour Scotland with Psydoll for a second time.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nMetaltech released their first EP, Alkomatic, on 10 July 2010 on Alex Tronic Records.  Their second Alex Tronic Records EP, Sex on the Dancefloor, was released on 3 September 2010 and featured remixes by other artists on the Alex Tronic label (Erik Tricity Electro Sex Mix, Vout Congo Helium Mix, Alex Tronic Tantric Trance Mix, and Neu Gestalt Mix).\nIn August 2010, Bannerman's Bar in Edinburgh released volume 6 of their Under the Bridge compilation album series.

The Skinny said Metaltech had; \"an obvious knack for knocking out extremely danceable industrial, the kind of music that you couldn't stop your head rhythmically swaying to, even if you wanted, and then filling the gaps with abundant 80's style guitar lines: simple, uncomplicated, melodic\".\nBrutal Resonance said; \"can the masked trio make a studio product that captures the same energy, showmanship and white-hot skill they put into every gig they play? The answer is an undeniable 'yes'. From the opening of the first track to the last Metaltech indelibly stamp themselves into your brain\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Alkomatic EP  (2010) ===\n\n Alkomatic EP  is the debut EP from Scottish metal band Metaltech, released in 2010.

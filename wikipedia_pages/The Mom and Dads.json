    "text": "The Mom and Dads were a Western-styled folk music group from Spokane, Washington that specialized in waltzes, polkas, and general easy listening.  The quartet, made up of one woman and three men, featured Doris A. Crow (June 17, 1905 – September 28, 1998) on piano,  Quentin Ratliff (August 13, 1933 - January 25, 2013) on saxophone, Leslie Welch (February 2, 1912 – February 1, 1983) on accordion, and Harold Hendren (July 12, 1919 - September 9, 2008) on drums.\n\n\n== Band Biography ==\n\nThe band, which formed in the early 1960s, named itself after its main repertoire; \"Music for Mom and Dad\". [1].  In the early years of its history, the band was strictly a part-time endeavor with its members holding down more typical jobs during the week.\nTheir LP album entitled Presenting... The Mom and Dads had a mini biography printed on the back of the album sleeve.  The section claimed that the Mom and Dads were able to play nearly any type of then existing dance music, from turn of the century dance music such as the Three Step, to more modern sounds, such as country and western.\nTheir biography states that all the band members had individually begun to play dance music between the ages of 12 and 14.  Doris Crow and Leslie Welch had been playing together for over 22 years when the youngest member of the band, Quentin Ratliff joined them.  The group finally became a four-piece 7 years later when Harold Hendren, who had begun his musical career in New Mexico, joined the band on drums.\nMost of the band's fame was in Canada and Australia. They first gained notoriety when a disc jockey from a high-powered radio station in Great Falls, Montana played their early recording, \"The Rangers Waltz\", a song composed by Quentin Ratliff, the group's saxophonist, also carrying into the Canadian province of Alberta. \"The Rangers Waltz\" was also released as a single in Australia, where it reached #2 on the national charts, and in New Zealand, where it reached #1 for one week in March '72. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_number-one_singles_in_1972_(New_Zealand)\n\"The Ranger's Waltz\" marked their peak in 1971, when the title cut off the same-named album climbed into the American Top 10 country music charts, topping out at Number Four and eventually achieving double-platinum sales figures.  The band had first started to appear on music charts earlier that year with the album \"In the Blue Canadian Rockies\".\nThe Mom and Dads also began their first international tour, albeit reluctantly, when they went to Australia in the fall of 1974, after another act had cancelled.  They spent four weeks promoting their albums overseas before returning home and resuming performance dates in their native Pacific Northwest.  \nThe group continued to tour and record regularly, until Welch's death in 1983.  The last album recorded before his death was \"Goodnight Sweetheart\". The band put out a final album, \"Thanks for the Memories\", in 1986 before disbanding.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Releases ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"The Ranger's Waltz\" GNP\n\"Amazing Grace\" GNP-Crescendo\n\"Anniversary Waltz\" GNP-Crescendo\n\"Auld Lang Syne\" GNP\n\"Baby Blue\" GNP-Crescendo\n\"Blue Canadian Rockies\" Golden West Melodies\n\"Blue Skirt Waltz\" MCA\n\"Cab Driver Foxtrot\"\n\"Jingle Bell Rock\" (1972) MCA\n\"Kentucky Waltz\" GNP Crescendo\n\"Love Is a Beautiful Song\" MCA\n\"Mom&Dad's Schottische\"\n\"Moonlight On The Manitoulin\" MCA\n\"My Blue Heaven\" GNP-Crescendo\n\"My Happiness\" (1973) GNP-Crescendo\n\"Quentin's E Flat Boogie\" GNP Crescendo\n\"Ragtime Annie P\"\n\"Rippling River Waltz\" (1971) MCA\n\"Silver Moon\"\n\"Skirts\"\n\"Somewhere My Love\"\n\"St Paul Waltz\"\n\"Wabash Cannonball\"\n\"Waltz Across Texas\"\n\"Waltz you Saved For Me\"/\"When The Saints Go Marching In\"\n\"Whispering\"\n\"White Silver Sands\"\n\"Your Cheatin' Heart\"\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nPresenting The Mom and Dads (1971) Apex\nBlue Canadian Rockies (1971) MCA\nSouvenirs (1972) MCA\nThe Mom and Dads Again (1972) MCA\nMerry Christmas (1973) MCA\nReminiscing with The Mom and Dads (1973) MCA\nLove Is a Beautiful Song (1974) MCA\nDance with The Mom and Dads (1974) MCA\n(The Mom and Dads) Play Your Favorite Hymns (1974) GRT\nIn The Good Old Summertime (1976)\nDown The River Of Golden Dreams (1976)\nMeet The Mom and Dads (1977) GRT\nBest Of (1977) GRT\nOne Dozen Roses (1977) GNP-Crescendo\nWhispering Hope (1977) GRT\n22 Favorite Country Songs (1977) GNP-Crescendo\nGratefully Yours (1978) Interfusion\n20 Favorite Waltzes (1978) GRT\nTo Mom and Dad With Love (1980) MCA\nWith Love From The Mom and Dads (1980) Crescendo\nGood Night Sweetheart (1982) Crescendo\nThanks For The Memories (1986) Quality\nDream With The Mom and Dads GRT\nLove Letters In The Sand Crescendo\nMemories (1976) Crescendo\nBlue Hawaii MCA\nThe Very Best Of MCA\n18 Cand W Favorites\nCollection (5 LP set)\nRangers Waltz\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSpokane M&D Unit Heads for Aussieland September 28th - Billboard magazine - August 24, 1974\nThe Mom & Dads - The Spokesman Review - Sunday, February 18, 1979\nDoris Crow obituary - The Spokesman Review - October 2, 1998\nQuentin Ratliff obituary - Legacy.com\nSocial Security Death Index"

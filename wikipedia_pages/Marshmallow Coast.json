Gonzales then recorded Timesquare with Julian Koster in 1997, although it was not released until 2000 due to various label disputes.\nGonzales dropped the project briefly to tour with the Music Tapes, and relocated to Athens, GA in 1998.  In Athens, Gonzales met Kevin Barnes and Derek Almstead.  With Barnes, Gonzales recorded Marshmallow Coast's debut LP Seniors & Juniors, released in 1999. Gonzales joined of Montreal that same year.\nThe next two albums, Marshmallow Coasting and Ride the Lightning were produced by Almstead. Gonzales then recorded Antistar with Sarah KirkPatrick, which was produced by Jason NeSmith and released in 2003.\nIn 2005, Gonzales announced the project would show same changes as Almstead began to contribute to songwriting. Emily Growden and Carlton Owens joined the group, and the name was changed to M Coast. A new album entitled Say It in Slang was released on HHBTM Records in 2006. \nIn November 2007, it was announced the group had parted ways. Gonzales reverted the name back to Marshmallow Coast.\nMarshmallow Coast returned in 2009 with the release of Phreak Phantasy on HHBTM.\nSeniors and Juniors Strikes Back was released on HHBTM in March 2011.

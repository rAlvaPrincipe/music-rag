    "text": "The Lindsay String Quartet (or The Lindsays) was a British string quartet from 1965 to 2005.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe quartet first performed at the Royal Academy of Music in 1965 to compete for a prize and set out to make the string quartets of Bartók and Beethoven the centre of their repertoire. In 1967, the quartet was appointed to be Leverhulme Scholars at Keele University, and in 1970, it changed its name from the Cropper to the Lindsay String Quartet, naming itself after Lord Lindsay, the founder of Keele University. 1971 brought a change in second violin to Ronald Birks. The quartet gained a Gramophone Award for the Late Beethoven Quartets in 1984. Roger Bigley left the quartet in 1985 to be replaced by Robin Ireland. Bigley then became assistant principal viola of the BBC Philharmonic orchestra before becoming assistant head of strings at the RNCM.\nIn 1974, they became Quartet-in-Residence at Sheffield University and five years later held a similar position at Manchester University, where they performed a regular concert season, directed seminars, and coached chamber ensembles. The quartet presented festivals each year at the Studio Theatre in the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, which featured many famous local and international musicians, and travelled widely throughout the world.\nIn 2005, after 39 years, the quartet announced their intended retirement the following year. They then performed a successful series of farewell concerts throughout the world, culminating in four final concerts in their home town of Sheffield in July 2005. Individual members afterwards pursued separate musical ideas.\nThe quartet produced an extensive list of recordings, including an acclaimed Beethoven cycle, and substantial parts of the Haydn, Mozart, Schubert and Dvořák repertoires.\nIn 2019, a book titled A Quintessential Quartet: The Story of the Lindsay String Quartet was written by Bernard Gregor-Smith, one of the founding members.\nLeader Peter Cropper (19 November 1945 – 29 May 2015) was the founding artistic director of Music in the Round, a charitable organisation he founded in the 1980s, that promotes chamber music concerts in Sheffield and nationally. The Lindsays formed the core of Music in the Round's activity for over twenty years, until their retirement. Cropper died suddenly in 2015 aged 69.\n\n\n== Members ==\nPeter Cropper (first violin)\nMichael Adamson (second violin, 1965–71)\nRonald Birks (second violin, 1971–2005)\nRoger Bigley (viola, 1965–85)\nRobin Ireland (viola, 1985–2005)\nBernard Gregor-Smith (cello)\n\n\n== Awards ==\nGramophone Award – 1984\nHonorary doctorate – Keele University, 1986\nHonorary doctorate – Sheffield Hallam University, 1990\nHonorary doctorate – University of Leicester, 1998\nHonorary doctorate – University of Sheffield, 2001\nHonorary doctorate – University of Manchester, 2005\n\n\n== Books ==\nA Quintessential Quartet: The Story of the Lindsay String Quartet written by Bernard Gregor-Smith\n\n\n== Art ==\nThe Lindsay String Quartet (Peter Cropper; Ronald Birks; Robin Ireland; Bernard Gregor-Smith) Hanging in The National Portrait Gallery, London, United Kingdom | by György Gordon | oil on canvas, 2003 | Primary Collection | NPG 6649\n\n\n== ASV Lindsay String Quartet discography ==\nBEETHOVEN: String Quartets \"Rasumovsky\" No. 7, Nos. 8 & 9 CD DCA 553, 554 \n\nBEETHOVEN: String Quartets Nos. 12–16 & Grosse Fuge CD DCA 601, 602, 603 & 604\n\nBEETHOVEN: String Quartets (The New Cycle):\n\nOpus 18, Nos. 1, 2 & 3 CD DCA 1111\nOpus 18, Nos. 4/5.

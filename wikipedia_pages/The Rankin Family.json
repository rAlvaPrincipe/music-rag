    "text": "The Rankin Family (also known as The Rankins) are a Canadian musical family group from Mabou, Nova Scotia. The group has won many Canadian music awards, including 15 East Coast Music Awards, six Juno Awards, four SOCAN Awards, three Canadian Country Music Awards and two Big Country Music Awards.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThe Rankins come from a family of 12 siblings, all of whom would entertain the neighbours musically every third weekend as part of a cèilidh. The first Rankin Family band formed in the 1970s when siblings Geraldine, Genevieve, David, John Morris, and Raylene Rankin began performing at local weddings and dances in Cape Breton. As the older siblings went away to college and university, the younger siblings Jimmy, Cookie and Heather took their places.\n\n\n=== 1989–1999 ===\nJimmy, John Morris, Cookie, Raylene and Heather Rankin released their own independent cassettes, The Rankin Family (1989) and Fare Thee Well Love (1990), featuring original songs and a combination of traditional jigs, reels and Celtic folk songs. These independent recordings were distributed by the Canadian independent folk music distribution company 'Soundwright' until the band's major label breakthrough with EMI. Their television debut was on the CBC Television variety show On the Road Again in 1989. EMI's re-release of Fare Thee Well Love in 1992, went quadruple platinum, selling over 500,000 copies; the title track was a Top 40 single in Canada.\nIn 1998 The Rankins first worked with The Chieftains on their album, Fire in the Kitchen, performing the Celtic song, \"An Innis Aigh\" (The Happy Isle). That year the band released an album, Uprooted, which had a country music flavour.\nOn September 17, 1999, after recording the song \"Jimmy Mo Mhile Stor\" with The Chieftains for their album, Tears of Stone, the group issued a press release stating that they would no longer perform as a group in order to pursue independent interests and careers.\n\n\n=== 2000–present ===\nOn January 16, 2000, John Morris Rankin was killed in a car accident in Cape Breton Island. His daughter Molly Rankin is now a musician, and is lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for the indie pop band Alvvays.\nIn the spring of 2000 Heather Rankin joined Carly Simon on her New York City promotional tour for Simon's record The Bedroom Tapes, and appeared with Simon on the Rosie O'Donnell show.\nJimmy Rankin has continued to write songs and has released five solo albums: Song Dog (2001), Handmade (2003), Edge of Day (2007), Forget About the World (2011), and Back Road Paradise (2014). Raylene Rankin released the solo albums Lambs in Spring (2004) and all the diamonds (2011) and live in Nashville. Heather Rankin released the solo albums A Fine Line (2016) and Imagine (2017); the first album included a cover of the Tears for Fears hit “Everybody Wants To Rule The World” featuring Halifax rapper, Quake Matthews. When not performing on their own, the sisters run The Red Shoe pub in Mabou.\nOne of the founders of the group, Geraldine Coyne (Rankin), died January 10, 2007, the result of a brain aneurysm, at her home in Calgary. She had not performed with the group since prior to the first recordings' being released.\nOn January 16, 2007, the album Reunion was released, and in 2009 the Rankin Family released their seventh studio album, These Are the Moments.\nOn June 3, 2012, Raylene Rankin appeared on CBC Radio's The Sunday Edition where she spoke about her decade-long struggle with cancer. She died of metastatic breast cancer on September 30, 2012. After funeral services in St. Thomas Aquinas Church in Halifax and St. Mary's Church in Mabou, she was buried in St. Mary's cemetery.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJimmy Rankin  – vocals, guitar\nCookie Rankin – vocals\nHeather Rankin – vocals\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nRaylene Rankin (1960–2012) – vocals\nJohn Morris Rankin (1959–2000) – piano, fiddle\nDavid Rankin – vocals\nGeraldine Rankin (1958–2007) – vocals\nGenevieve Rankin – vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\n1989: The Rankin Family\n1990: Fare Thee Well Love\n1993: North Country\n1995: Endless Seasons\n1998: Uprooted\n2007: Reunion\n2009: These Are the Moments\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRaylene Rankin at IMDb\nThe Rankin Family discography at Discogs\nThe Rankin Family at IMDb"

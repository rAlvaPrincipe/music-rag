    "text": "Vengaboys ( BENG-gə-boyz) is a Dutch Eurodance music group based in Rotterdam consisting of lead and female vocalist Kim Sasabone, female vocalist Denise van Rijswijk and male vocalists Robin Pors and Donny Latupeirissa. Created by Dutch producers Wessel van Diepen (who selected the group members) and Dennis van den Driesschen (known as Danski and Delmundo), the group enjoyed commercial success in the late 1990s. They are best known for their hit singles \"We Like to Party\", \"Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!\", and \"We're Going to Ibiza\", the latter two of which topped the UK Singles Chart and have sold an estimated 25 million records worldwide. \nOn 2 May 2000, the World Music Awards gave Vengaboys the award for best-selling dance group of the year. In 2019, Dutch online newspaper Nu.nl called Vengaboys the most successful Dutch pop group in history.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1996–1998: Formation, Up and Down, and The Party Album ===\nThe name \"Vengaboys\" was originally the title of the electronic musical project of Dutch producers Danski and Delmundo as DJs in the early 90's. In 1997 they decided to use the name to produce a pop group, choosing the Brazilian-Dutch singer Kim Sasabone as the vocal lead. After some auditions, Denise Post-Van Rijswijk, Roy den Burger and Robin Pors were added to complete the group. \nIn August 1997, the group released their debut single \"Parada de Tettas\", followed by \"To Brazil!\" in December 1997 and \"Up and Down\" in February 1998. In  April 1998, the group released their debut album Up & Down - The Party Album in the Netherlands and Belgium. The album was certified gold in the Netherlands. This was followed by \"We Like to Party!\" in May, which peaked at number 2 on the Dutch charts and at number 1 in Belgium in June 1998.\nIn October the group released \"Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!\" and Greatest Hits! Part 1, the album peaked at number 1 on the Dutch chart.\nIn November 1998, the Vengaboys entered the UK Singles Chart at number 4 with \"Up and Down\". \"We Like to Party!\" was released internationally in 1999 and was a Top 10 hit in many European countries, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. It reached number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100. \nIn June 1999, The Vengaboys released Greatest Hits! Part 1 as The Party Album; their debut studio album. The single \"Boom Boom Boom Boom\" topped the charts in the UK, New Zealand and the Netherlands. In November 1999 \"Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!\" was also used in an advert in Japan for Nissan for their Wingroad 5-door estate.\n\"We're Going to Ibiza\", a reworking of Typically Tropical's 1975 number 1 hit \"Barbados\", also reached the top slot in the Netherlands in September 1999. The LP spent 30 consecutive weeks on the U.S. Billboard 200, and was certified gold (500,000 units) in November 1999. \nThe Remix Album was released in January 2000, featuring new dance remixes of the songs from the Vengaboys' debut record.\n\n\n=== 2000–2002: Departure of Pors, The Platinum Album and hiatus ===\nShortly before the release of their next studio album, Pors left the group to pursue a solo career and was replaced by dolphin trainer Yorick Bakker. \nThe Platinum Album was released in early 2000, which saw continued success for the group, as its first three singles \"Kiss (When the Sun Don't Shine)\", \"Shalala Lala\" and \"Uncle John from Jamaica\" all charted in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and Canada, with the first two going on to top the New Zealand charts. For the album's fourth single, \"Cheekah Bow Bow (That Computer Song)\", the group gained a virtual member, the animated Cheekah. \nIn 2002 Post-Van Rijswijk and Bakker left the group which ceased its activities.\n\n\n=== 2007–2009: Return on stage and line-up changes ===\nIn 2007, the group returned to the club scene with new member Donny Latupeirissa a.k.a.

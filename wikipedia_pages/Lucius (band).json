    "text": "Lucius is an American four-piece indie pop band. The group was founded in 2007 by lead vocalists Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig, joined by drummer Dan Molad, guitarist Peter Lalish, and, formerly, multi-instrumentalist Andrew Burri. Originating in Brooklyn, the band relocated to Los Angeles in 2015.\nThey have released three studio albums with Mom + Pop Music, including their most recent, Second Nature, in April 2022. Their music has received critical acclaim from The New York Times, Rolling Stone, NPR and The Village Voice. Paste named them as one of the best live acts in 2015. Wolfe and Laessig have also contributed vocals for artists such as Roger Waters, Harry Styles, Jeff Tweedy, Jackson Browne, John Legend, Mavis Staples, John Prine, Sheryl Crow, Grace Potter, Goose, The War on Drugs, Brandi Carlile, Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real, Brandy Clark, and Joni Mitchell.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Songs from the Bromley House and band formation (2005–2011) ===\nJess Wolfe and Holly Laessig first met in 2005 as students at the Berklee College of Music and began performing together. In 2007, they founded Lucius after moving to Ditmas Park, Brooklyn to pursue a musical career. The two lived in an old Victorian mansion which had a 60-year-old recording studio and vintage pianos inside.\nIn 2009, Wolfe and Laessig self-released Songs from the Bromley House, a biographical ode to the house and the experiences that they had in their Brooklyn home. During this period, they were joined by producer Doug Wamble. The band made a one-time pressing CD of the album and has not released the album since.\nShortly after the release of Songs from the Bromley House, Wolfe and Laessig connected with Dan Molad. By 2010, the three were collaborating on future Lucius music. During this period, Pete Lalish was introduced by Molad, and the two soon joined Lucius, making it a four-piece. About a year later, Molad met singer and guitarist Andy Burri who was invited to join the band. Following this, in 2011, most of the music the band had already made together was re-recorded and later released as their debut EP.\nOn July 9, 2020, Lucius announced they would be digitally re-releasing Songs from the Bromley House to raise funds for businesses affected by the COVID-19 virus. Wolfe told fans the news during an \"Ask Me Anything\" portion of their livestream series, Turning It Around: A Community Rebuilding Concert. The album, she said, would be up for purchase on the band's website for a limited time along with several other unique items created especially for the streaming series.\n\n\n=== Lucius EP and Wildewoman (2011–2015) ===\n\nThe quintet released a self-titled EP in February 2012. Lucius received several placements in TV shows including Grey's Anatomy and Catfish: The TV Show. The band did a Tiny Desk Concerts performance in January 2013 which is hailed by fans as one of their most iconic performances to this day. That same year, the Silver Sound Music Video Film Festival + Band Battle awarded the \"Go Home\" video as Best Animation. Their song \"Until We Get There\" gained significant popularity after its feature in season 2, episode 24 of the TV show New Girl.\nThe band toured the EP throughout the first half of 2013 while finishing the recording of Wildewoman–produced by band member Dan Molad. Mom + Pop Music released Wildewoman in North America on October 15, 2013. It received favorable reviews from Rolling Stone and Consequence of Sound. The album was released worldwide on March 31, 2014, via Play It Again Sam. The Guardian described it as \"60s girl group-inspired songs doused in a tonic of baroque pop and saccharine folk.\" The record was praised for its eclectic mix of musical styles that ranged from retro pop to reflective folk.\nThe song \"Until We Get There\" was featured in the film If I Stay and was included on the 2014 soundtrack.\nDuring their world tour between the fall of 2013 and the end of 2014, Lucius also played music festivals and opened for artists including Tegan and Sara, The Head and the Heart, Sara Bareilles, Andrew Bird, City and Colour, and Jack White.\nThe deluxe version of Wildewoman was released in October 2014. It features live recordings and covers, with one version of their song \"How Loud Your Heart Gets\" produced by Spoon's Jim Eno for Spotify. The band ended their world tour with a sold-out show at Terminal 5 in New York on December 6, 2014.\n\n\n=== Good Grief (2016– early 2017) ===\nThe band's second album, Good Grief, was released on March 11, 2016. It was co-produced and engineered by Grammy-winning engineer Shawn Everett, and was mixed by Tom Elmhirst. Songs were inspired by the band's two years on the road with Wildewoman, and  written in late 2015 when the band relocated from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. Departing from their previous sound, the album focused on \"moody Eighties-synth melodies and raw lyrics about the hardships of marriage.\"\nThe deluxe edition of Good Grief features the band's cover of The Kinks' song \"Strangers\" which gained attention from a crowd-sourced video of the band performing in Petaluma, California in August 2014.\nIn July 2015, Wolfe and Laessig performed with Roger Waters and My Morning Jacket at the Newport Folk Festival.\nThe band has also performed tracks from Good Grief on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and Late Night with Seth Meyers. \"Born Again Teen\" and \"Dusty Trails\" were featured on the fifth episode of Cameron Crowe's show Roadies. In the final episode of the first season, Wolfe and Laessig performed the Lowell George song \"Willin\" with Jackson Browne. In September 2016, Andrew Burri departed from the band.\nIn September and October 2016, the band performed with Waters and his band for three shows in Mexico City and the Desert Trip Festival in Indio, California.\nOn November 25, 2016, the band released a two-song 10 inch vinyl record titled Pulling Teeth which contained two B-sides–\"Pulling Teeth\" and \"The Punisher\".\n\n\n=== Nudes and Touring with Roger Waters (mid 2017–2021) ===\nThe band released their first compilation album, Nudes, in March 2018. The collection features acoustic versions of songs from the band's back catalogue, new songs, and a duet with Roger Waters.\nWolfe and Laessig joined Waters to sing backup vocals on the Us + Them Tour. The pair also sang a featured duet based on Clare Torrey's wordless vocals in The Great Gig in the Sky. The tour covered North America, New Zealand, Australia, Europe, South America, and Mexico. The world tour began in Kansas City in May 2017, and ended in Monterrey, Mexico in December 2018.\n\n\n=== Second Nature (2022–present) ===\n\nAfter years of collaborations, Lucius returned to their own music with their fourth studio album, Second Nature, on April 8, 2022. Second Nature was produced by Dave Cobb and Brandi Carlile and released on the Mom + Pop Music label. The lead single \"Next to Normal\" was released simultaneously with the album announcement on January 11, 2022, followed by three other singles \"White Lies\", \"Heartbursts\", and \"Dance Around It\"–a dance song that features Sheryl Crow and Brandi Carlile.\nIn a press release, Lucius member Jess Wolfe stated that the album derived from the personal experiences of grief that she and the rest of the band experienced during the pandemic, further adding that the album's musical direction was intended for the band to \"[dance their] way through the darkness\".\nSecond Nature earned Lucius a nomination for Best Pop Record from The American Association of Independent Music.\nOn November 2, 2022, Lucius released \"Muse\" as a single.\nLucius toured Second Nature on their headlining North American tour throughout 2022 and 2023. They  also toured with Shakey Graves throughout summer 2023 and supported Gregory Alan Isakov in the fall.\nLucius supported The War on Drugs and The National in Summer and Fall 2024.

How can they fail?  They won't.\" Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman is a noted fan of the band and has featured their music in his blog.\nThe two frontwomen are also known for their synchronous style that exudes an \"idiosyncratic visual persona\" in their choice of dress, stage set up, and performance.

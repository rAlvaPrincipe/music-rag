    "text": "Blou is a band from Meteghan, Nova Scotia, founded in 1994.  The group claims a unique style of music they call 'Acadico' – a mix of Acadian, Cajun and Zydeco styles. The group takes its name from the street where founding member Patrice Boulianne resides: L'Allée des Blou was named after an aboriginal man purported to have lived at the end of that street 100 years earlier.\nThe original band members were Patrice Boulianne (accordion, guitar, vocals), Paul Melanson(guitar, mandolin,vocals), Len LeBlanc (harmonica, guitar, percussion ,vocals), Owen Muise(electric bass, drum, vocals), and drummer Tommy Maillet\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1998, Blou self-produced its first recording, Acadico. This was the first CD by an Acadian artist that had a European distribution, and it won the band the East Coast Music Association's 1999 award for Acadian Recording of the Year.\nIn 2000, Blou released its second album, Rhythm 'N Blou, which had a more upbeat sound than Acadico. This album brought two 2001 East Coast Music Association nominations, for Acadian Recording of the Year, and Roots/Traditional Recording of the Year. and the band toured internationally.  In 2003, Blou released their third album, Blou Blanc Rouge, which brought a 2004 East Coast Music Award for Francophone Recording of the Year, and nominations for 2004 Entertainer of the Year and 2005 Roots/Traditional Group Recording of the Year.

    "text": "Frost Children is an American pop duo from St. Louis, Missouri, now residing near Ridgewood in New York City. The duo consists of siblings Angel and Lulu Prost.\n\n\n== History ==\nAngel Prost was born in Kentucky before moving to St. Louis when she was a year old. When she was two, her sister, Lulu Prost, was born. The family often performed at Sunday mass with Angel and Lulu playing the bass and drums respectively. The pair became involved with a number of cover bands, particularly covering Green Day songs with their brother Brian. Lulu began a Beatles cover band known as the Termites, and Angel joined the band Permafrost and performed songs from the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World soundtrack.\nAngel moved to the Bronx in New York in 2016 to study neuroscience, and Lulu studied at music school in Nashville. The duo formed Frost Children and began their career as a duo in 2019 remotely from each other, releasing a cover of Fall Out Boy's song \"Yule Shoot Your Eye Out\". In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the duo quarantined in their home in St. Louis, and began making music together there. They released their first collection of songs, titled Aviation Creates Adventurous Beginnings, the same year. They also launched their side-project YourBoySponge which involved SpongeBob SquarePants themed battle rap.\nIn 2021, the duo both moved to New York after Lulu became disillusioned with music school. They released the album Elixir Rejection, which they have since referred to as \"a product of early-pandemic collaboration.\"\nFollowing the release of singles \"Get What We Want\" and \"Mayfly\", the latter of which featured musician Gary Wilson, the duo released their debut full-length album in 2022 titled Spiral. The album was recorded in upstate New York after Lulu returned from Nashville to work on the album in person. The band became popular in the creative scenes in downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn, particularly in the Dimes Square nightlife scene.\nThe duo released the single \"Flatline\" in January 2023, followed by singles \"All I Got\" and \"Hi 5\" in March. Following this, they released their second full-length album Speed Run on April 14 of the same year, featuring artists EXUM, May Rio, 8485, and Frost Children's manager Blaketheman1000. Lulu has referred to the project as a \"the-pop-artist-big-ego-paparazzi\" album and a \"club record.\"\nSpeed Run was followed by a more analog-sounding companion project, Hearth Room, which Lulu described as an \"ego-death-lifestyle-moved-upstate\" album, released November 17, 2023 following its singles \"Lethal\" and \"Stare At The Sun\". Pitchfork described that Hearth Room's songs had a \"gentler and sweeter sound\" and followed \"more conventional pop structures\", comparing it to the work of Modest Mouse and Alex G. One catalyst for the album's sound was a head injury suffered by Angel at a club on Irving Avenue, as she only wanted to hear and make “lush, acoustic” music while recovering. The group embarked on a North American tour in 2024.\nThe duo featured in the song \"Mona Lisa\" on Porter Robinson's July 2024 album Smile! :D. On 15 August 2024, the duo released the single \"Shake It Like A\", featuring Danny Brown. They released a new EP with Haru Nemuri titled Soul Kiss on 4 October, having formed a friendship with Nemuri when they had performed at the same music festivals several years prior. Songs from the EP were created by way of the artists sending the files to each other online and testing the songs out at nightclubs in Berlin. The EP featured elements of hardcore punk and shoegaze.\n\n\n== Production style and influences ==\nFrost Children's style has been described as hyperpop and glitchcore, but often includes elements of synth pop, punk rock, electro punk, hardstyle, and screamo. They have been compared to the 2010s indie sleaze aesthetic, and take heavy influence from the internet and meme culture. The group reject the barriers of genre to an extent, aside from punk. Their lyrics contain themes of alienation and gender dysphoria.\nIn childhood, the pair became interested in emo music through watching YouTube on their father's desktop computer, including the bands The Fray and Say Anything. They have stated other early influences from genres such as EDM and dubstep, having listened to  Deadmau5 and Skrillex together during their childhood, as well as shows from UKF Music and Ultra Music Festival. Later in life, Angel's influences included bedroom pop acts Alex G and Horse Jumper of Love.\n\n\n== Community ==\nSeveral publications have referred to the \"tight-knit community\" fostered by the group, particularly via Discord and Instagram, with i-D identifying the group's fans as being made up of \"music nerds, fashion kids and the hyper-online.\" The Face described the band's audience during their 2024 tour, writing that \"kids with furry tails, SpongeBob merch and Pokémon backpacks rave[d] besides silver-haired indie rockers in weather-appropriate beanies and down jackets.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAviation Creates Adventurous Beginnings (2020)\nElixir Rejection (2021)\nSpiral (2022)\nSpeed Run (2023)\nHearth Room (2023)\nSoul Kiss (2024)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

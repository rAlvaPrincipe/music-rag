    "text": "Circle Takes the Square is an American screamo band from Savannah, Georgia. It is composed of founding members Drew Speziale and Kathleen Stubelek, as well as Caleb Collins. Their debut release was a 6-track self-titled EP released in 2001, followed by a 7\" split with Pg. 99 in 2002. In 2004, they released their debut studio album As the Roots Undo on Robotic Empire, which released the CD, and HyperRealist Records, which released the gatefold LP. The album gained them considerable acclaim and the band toured extensively to promote it during the year. This included a six-week east coast tour that took the band into Canada for the first time, supported by Arkata and Raise Them And Eat Them. The band's second album, Decompositions: Volume Number One, was released after an 8-year silence on December 21, 2012, as a digital download; physical editions of the album were released in April 2013.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\n\nBen Sailer of Noisey wrote that As the Roots Undo, which Drew Speziale describes as \"just a punk rock record from 2004\", has long garnered praise from both the press and fans alike for its forward-thinking blend of 90s screamo, fractured grindcore, and experimental post-rock. Metal Injection described their style as a \"blend of progressive experimentation and DIY hardcore, metal, and noise [...] characterized by a natural fusion of the off-the-wall structures of grindcore and the sweeping guitar dynamics of post-punk\". The band themselves have described the sound as \"...a punk rock band with reverence for the Mystery.\" \n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMetal Injection called Circle Takes the Square \"legendary\". Writing for NPR music, Lars Gotrich credited Circle Takes the Square alongside Pg. 99, Orchid and Majority Rule as pioneers of emotional post-hardcore.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent\nDrew Speziale – guitars, strings, piano, keyboard, vocals (1999–present)\nKathleen Coppola Stubelek – bass, vocals (1999–present)\nCaleb Collins – drums, percussion, samples, programming, synthesizers (2007–present)\nAnthony Stubelek - live production (2004–present)\nFormer\nRobbie Rose – vocals (1999–2000)\nCollin Kelly – guitar (1999–2002)\nJay Wynne – drums, percussion (1999–2005)\nBobby Scandiffio – guitar (2004–2006; died 2011)\nJosh Ortega – drums, percussion (2005–2007)\nDavid Rabitor – guitars, backing vocals (2007–2013)\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nAs the Roots Undo (2004, Robotic Empire/HyperRealist)\nDecompositions: Volume Number One (2012, Gatepost Recordings)\nEPs\nCircle Takes the Square (2001, self-released/HyperRealist)\nDocument #13: Pyramids in Cloth (split w/Pg. 99, August 2002, Perpetual Motion Machine)\nDecompositions: Volume Number One, Chapter I: Rites of Initiation  (2011, Gatepost Recordings)\nCompilations\n\"In the Nervous Light of Sunday\" (Alternate version) 10\" vinyl only(2004, Monocore Records)\n\"Crowquill\" — Building Records Presents 60 Songs (November 2003, Building)\n\"Non-Objective Portrait of Karma\" — Robotic Empire Sampler No. 2 (2004, Robotic Empire)\n\"The Conspiracy of Seeds\" — 65daysofstatic - The Destruction of Small Ideas (April 2007, Monotreme)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nCircle Takes the Square at AllMusic"

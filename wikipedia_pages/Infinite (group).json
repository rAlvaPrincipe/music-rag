    "text": "Infinite (Korean: 인피니트; RR: Inpiniteu; stylized in all caps) is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010 by Woollim Entertainment. The group is composed of six members: Sungkyu, Dongwoo, Woohyun, Sungyeol, L, and Sungjong. Originally a seven-piece group, Hoya departed from the group on August 30, 2017.\nInfinite debuted in June 2010 with their EP First Invasion. In 2012, the single \"The Chaser\" was named Billboard's third best K-pop song of the 2010s decade and was included in Rolling Stone's list of 75 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time in 2020. Billboard subsequently launched their K-pop column \"K-Town\" with Infinite in January 2013. In March of that year, Infinite's fourth EP New Challenge sold over 160,000 copies in South Korea alone, making it among the best-selling albums of 2013, with the single \"Man in Love\" also experiencing success. Shortly after this, Infinite became the first Korean artist to obtain permission to film at Universal Studios Hollywood for their second single album Destiny. In 2014, Infinite became the first Korean act to top Billboard's Emerging Artists Chart.\nInfinite are known for their highly synchronized dancing and choreography as well as their live vocals. They have also endorsed several brands including Samsung and Pepsi, and were the ambassadors for UNICEF's 2012 Birthday Campaign. The group placed within the top 20 on the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 rankings in 2013 and 2014.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to Infinite's debut, Woollim Entertainment was a small company that housed only alternative artists, primarily depending on the activities of indie-rock band Nell and popular hip-hop group Epik High. Woollim's plans to debut their first idol group, which were first revealed in early 2010, came after Epik High's departure from the agency in 2008 and a noticeable increase in popularity of K-pop at the time. Attention was first drawn to Infinite before their debut when it was announced that Epik High had merged their new independent label with Woollim and were playing an active role in the debut of the new idol group. Infinite was marketed as a group that, despite being a K-pop idol band, would remain close to Woollim's roots of alternative music by releasing songs with a unique genre that can be differentiated from other singers in the industry.\nThe name \"Infinite\" was initially suggested by MC the Max member J.Yoon, and was ultimately chosen as the group's official name amongst other options including \"Big Dipper\", \"Blackberry\", and \"Super Sonic\". \"Infinite\" can be understood to convey the limitless possibilities of Infinite, representing the fact that Infinite will continue to grow and develop endlessly, without being restrained by any boundaries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2010: Debut ===\nPrior to their debut, Infinite participated in the 2010 Winter Olympics by providing vocals in the chorus of Epik High's supporting song.\nL, Sungkyu, Woohyun, and Sungjong appeared in Epik High's music video \"Run\" while Hoya and Dongwoo served as backup dancers during music shows performances.

    "text": "The Andantes were an American female session group for the Motown record label during the 1960s. Composed of Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow, and Louvain Demps, the group sang background vocals on numerous Motown recordings, including songs by Martha Reeves & the Vandellas, the Temptations, Stevie Wonder, the Four Tops, Jimmy Ruffin, Edwin Starr, the Supremes, the Marvelettes, Marvin Gaye and the Isley Brothers, among others. It is estimated they appeared on 20,000 recordings. \nThe Andantes provided back-up singing on Motown singles starting in 1962. The group was most prominently used on all of the Four Tops' Holland–Dozier–Holland-produced hits, including \"Baby I Need Your Loving\", \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\", \"Reach Out I'll Be There\", and more. Motown began to use the Andantes as either substitute or additional background vocalists on certain recordings by its girl groups beginning with the Marvelettes recordings in 1965, Martha & the Vandellas in 1966, and major part of the Supremes recordings between 1968–1969 although Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong continued to record. \nIn 1963, the Andantes, with the Marvelettes, released the single \"Too Hurt to Cry, Too Much in Love to Say Goodbye\" b/w \"Come on Home\" as credited to the Darnells. In 1964 they released a single of their own called \"(Like A) Nightmare\" b/w \"If You Were Mine\", though none of the actual Andantes sang lead on either track (future Marvelette Ann Bogan performed the lead vocals).\nThe Andantes are also featured on some records that were not produced by Motown Records, the most prominent example being Jackie Wilson's \"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher\" (Pat Lewis substitutes for Louvain Demps on this track). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, The Andantes were signed to Motorcity Records, recording songs on their own, as well as once again serving as backing vocalists to fellow former Motown artists. During this time, Lewis had joined the group as a full-time member.\nIn addition to various awards, the Andantes were inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in August 2014.\nMarlene Barrow died on February 23, 2015, at the age of 73. Pat Lewis died on September 2, 2024, at the age of 76.\n\n\n== Motown ==\n\nThroughout the 1960s and early 1970s, the Andantes appeared as backing vocalists on many of Motown's recorded singles, as the Funk Brothers also had when providing instrumentation. Seven of these singles that they provided background vocals for would go on to chart at the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 popular music chart.\n\n\n== Non-Motown recordings ==\nThe Andantes also appear on several notable recordings produced and/or released by record companies outside of Motown, including:\n\n\"Come On\" – The Distants\n\"All Right\" – The Distants\n\"Your Love\" – Billy Kent\n\"He Gave Me You\" – Marv Johnson\nThe Big Soul of John Lee Hooker – John Lee Hooker (with Mary Wilson)\n\"Prince of Players\" – Betty Everett\nJohn Lee Hooker on Campus – John Lee Hooker\n\"To Win Your Heart\" – Laura Lee\n\"Agent Double-O-Soul\" – Edwin Starr\n\"Whispers (Gettin' Louder)\" – Jackie Wilson\n\"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher\" – Jackie Wilson (Pat Lewis substitutes for group member Louvain Demps)\nThe Andantes also appear on much of the accompanying Higher and Higher album\n\"I Get the Sweetest Feeling\" – Jackie Wilson\n\n\n== Motorcity Records ==\nAs part of the Ian Levine's Motorcity Records project in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Andantes were signed to the label and once again provided a service in recording backing vocals to former Motown artists. By this time, Pat Lewis had joined Jackie Hicks, Barrow and Demps (from 1989 to 1992).\nLevine also recorded several songs with the Andantes, issuing a new single \"Lightning Never Strikes Twice\", which featured Demps on lead vocals. Most other songs recorded by the group at Motorcity had Lewis on lead vocals.\n\n\n=== Motorcity recordings ===\nOriginal recordings\n\n\"Lightning Never Strikes Twice\"\n\"Hurricane\"\n\"Throw Love Away\"\n\"Step Into My Shoes\" – also recorded by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas\n\"Two Sides Of Love\"\n\"One Drop Of Rain\"\n\"Will You Always Be There\"\n\"Love Is A Bumpy Road\"\n\"All Around the Motorcity\"\nCover versions\n\n\"Girls Are Out To Get You\"\n\"Superstition\"\n\"Mercy, Mercy Me\"\n\"I Wish\" – cover of the Stevie Wonder classic\n\"My World Is Empty Without You\"\n\"The Boss\"\n\"Last Dance\"\n\"Little Darlin'\"\n\"Why Am I Loving You\"\nUnreleased tracks\n\n\"Back In My Arms Again\"\n\"In And Out Of Love\"\n\"I Wish It Would Rain\"\n\"Waste of Time\" (Instrumental only)\nLouvain Demps – Better Times\nWhilst under contract to Motorcity Records, Louvain was given the opportunity to step up to the microphone and record a full album, which was released in 1992 under the title Better Times, which includes original tunes and one cover of the Diana Ross hit \"Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)\".\n\n\"On the Front Page\"\n\"Better times\"\n\"One Shot At Happiness\"\n\"Lost & Found\"\n\"Good Intentions\"\n\"Blind Love\"\n\"On the Beach\"\n\"My Heart Won't Say No\"\n\"No Time For Tears\"\n\"Reach Out & Touch Somebody's Hand\"\nLouvain recorded two further tracks with Motorcity which did not appear on the above album:\n\n\"On Top Of the Mountain\"\n\"Sight And Sound\"\nPat Lewis\nIan Levine has claimed that he has recorded more songs with Pat Lewis than with any other artist.

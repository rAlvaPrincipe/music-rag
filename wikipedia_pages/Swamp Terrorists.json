    "text": "The Swamp Terrorists were a Swiss electro-industrial music group that was formed in 1988 by STR, Ane H, and Francis H. Their music is harsh pounding electro-industrial/industrial hip hop beats, turntables and occasional rapping mixed with grinding metal guitar riffs (which are usually sampled from other heavy metal bands), and produces a sound similar to Die Warzau, KMFDM and White Zombie.\n\n\n== History ==\n'Swamp Terrorists' were a Swiss electro-industrial music group that was started in the late 1980s by synthesizer programmer STR, (of Band Berne Crematoire, Nacht-Raum, and Strangler of the Swamp fame), vocalist Ane Hebeisen (aka Ane H), (formerly of Tierstein) and guitarist Francis H. Francis H departed from the group after the release of their first EP He is Guilty, after which Ane and STR recorded their first album Grim – Stroke – Disease together and released it on the Machinery/Noise label in 1991. About a year later, it was followed by Grow – Speed – Injection.\nShortly after the 1994 album Combat Shock, Swamp Terrorists added several members for their live show: bassist Anrej A, guitarist Spring and drummer Piet Hertig. The band had a dedicated following in Brazil, where they have toured and where their international fan club was based.\nSTR left the band immediately following the 1995 release Killer, and began to work with the guitar-heavy Hellsau. The other four members of the band, as well as STR's live replacement ND, have since released a live album, Five in Japan and 2 EPs: Wreck in 1997, and Rare & Unreleased in 1999, on Metropolis Records. The band has been inactive since.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Discography ===\nStudio albums\n\nGrim – Stroke – Disease (1990, Machinery)\nGrow – Speed – Injection (1991, Machinery)\nCombat Shock (1993, Alfa International/Contempo)\nKiller (1996, Metropolis)\nLive albums\n\nFive in Japan (1997, Metropolis)\nCompilation albums\n\nRare & Unreleased (1999, Metropolis)\nEPs\n\nHe Is Guilty (1989, 150 BPM)\nNightmare (1991, Noise)\nThe Pale Torment EP (1994, Sub/Mission)\nThe Get O.

They are regarded as one of the pioneering acts in the Japanese hip hop scene.\n\n\n== History ==\nSoul Scream were formed in 1994, consisting of rappers HAB I SCREAM, E.G.G.MAN and DJ CELORY. They released their debut album THE \"DEEP\" in 1996, featuring appearances from other hip hop acts Zeebra, K Dub Shine and Rhymester. The album is widely regarded as an essential album in the Japanese hip hop scene. Their single Hachi to Chou (蜂と蝶), released in 2000 is also viewed as an all-time classic song in the genre. They went on to release an EP titled TOu-KYOu in 1997 followed by two more albums, The Positive Gravity: ~案とヒント~ in 1999 and Future is Now in 2002. They then went on an 18-year hiatus while all pursuing solo careers until releasing the single Love, Peace & Happiness in 2020 followed by more singles over the years.

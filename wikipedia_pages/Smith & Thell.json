So the album was written on the way while all these things happened.\"\n“We can't seem to get away from the sharp emotional turns in our music... [we] travel from the lowest pitch black bottom to the euphoric highs.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nStatue (2016)\nTelephone Wires (2018)\nA Chosen Family (2024)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2015 Denniz Pop Awards - \"Rookie Artist of the Year\"\n2016 Musexpo in Los Angeles - \"New Emerging International Artist\"\n2020 Swedish Grammis - Composers of the Year\n2021 Swedish Rockbjörnen - \"Best Group 2021\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSmith & Thell on Twitter \nSmith & Thell on Facebook"

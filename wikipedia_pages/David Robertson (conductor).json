    "text": "David Eric Robertson (born July 19, 1958) is an American conductor. He was chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and was formerly music director of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra from 2005 until 2018. He is Director of Orchestral Studies at Juilliard.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nRobertson was born and raised in Malibu, California, and grew up in a music-loving family. His father was a research scientist at Hughes Laboratory and his mother studied literature, but later had a career as a baker.  In grade school, he played French horn and violin, and first conducted at age 12.  He later studied horn, composition, and conducting as a college student at the Royal Academy of Music in London.\n\n\n=== Career ===\nAfter his college years, Robertson began to receive conducting offers in Europe and performed often in both symphonic and operatic repertoire. His early career lectured under the rubric of the U.S. Information Agency in the Middle East and around the world on the subject of music. In 1985, Robertson was appointed resident conductor of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra.\nFrom 1992 to 2000, Robertson was music director of the Paris-based Ensemble Intercontemporain (EIC), the first American to hold the post.  He broadened the EIC's repertoire to include works by composers such as John Adams.  In 2000, Robertson was named the Music Director of the Orchestre National de Lyon (ONL) and artistic director of Lyon's Auditorium.  He was the first individual to serve simultaneously in both capacities and the first American to be appointed to either position.  He and the ONL toured the United States in 2003, with concerts in New York City, Seattle, Berkeley, and Los Angeles. He concluded his tenure in Lyon in 2004.\n\n\n=== St. Louis Symphony Orchestra ===\nRobertson's relationship with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra (SLSO) began in January 1999 when he made his first conducting appearance with the orchestra.  Robertson's second appearance with the SLSO occurred in February 2002 at Carnegie Hall after the SLSO's then-music director  Hans Vonk withdrew a few days before the concert due to health problems.  Robertson agreed to substitute, and he and the orchestra had only one rehearsal before the concert. He later appeared with the SLSO in March 2003.  The SLSO named Robertson its next Music Director in December 2003, effective with the 2005-2006 season.\nIn April 2005, Robertson led the SLSO for the second time in a Carnegie Hall concert, after a labor dispute at the SLSO was resolved. Robertson conducted the SLSO in Carnegie Hall again in November 2005, March and April 2006, and March 2007. Robertson was one of Carnegie Hall's Perspectives artists for the 2005-2006 season, and he curated concerts with the SLSO and other performances with various guest artists and ensembles.\nRobertson is generally regarded as having restored the SLSO's artistic prominence after the sudden resignation of the prior music director Hans Vonk, and the orchestra's labor dispute in the winter of 2005. New concert series begun during his tenure include a group of contemporary music concerts with the Pulitzer Arts Foundation and a series of \"Fusion Concerts\" at the Touhill Performing Arts Center of the University of Missouri–St. Louis. In September 2006, the SLSO announced the extension of Robertson's contract through 2010, with a clause to allow for yearly renewal. As of November 2009, his SLSO contract was through the 2011-2012 season. Following a subsequent contract renewal through 2014, his SLSO contract was extended, in January 2013, through the 2015-2016 season.c  In March 2014, the orchestra and Robertson announced a further extension of his SLSO contract through the 2017-2018 season.  In December 2016, the SLSO and Robertson jointly announced an additional one-year extension of his contract through the 2018-2019 season, which was the intended time for the close of his SLSO tenure.  However, in June 2017, the orchestra noted an update to Robertson's contract, with a newly scheduled conclusion of his music directorship at the close of the 2017-2018 season, in a reversion of the December 2016 situation.  Robertson stood down as SLSO music director in 2018.\nDuring Robertson's tenure, the SLSO made its first-ever appearance at The Proms in September 2012.  With the SLSO, Robertson has conducted several commercial recordings of music of John Adams (composer) for the Nonesuch label.  These works include:\n\nGuide to Strange Places, Doctor Atomic Symphony (revised version)\nCity Noir, Saxophone Concerto\nScheherazade.2\n\n\n=== Other conducting work ===\nIn February 2005, Robertson was named the principal guest conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBC SO) and he assumed that post later in the year, in parallel with the beginning of his St. Louis tenure.  On September 12, 2009, Robertson became the second American conductor and the first standing BBC SO principal guest conductor to conduct the Last Night of the Proms.

He returned for an additional guest-conducting engagement with the Utah Symphony in December 2021.

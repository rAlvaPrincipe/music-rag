    "text": "Remember Shakti is a quintet which combines elements of traditional Indian music with elements of jazz. The band consists of English guitarist John McLaughlin, and Zakir Hussain (tabla), U. Srinivas (deceased) (mandolin), Shankar Mahadevan (vocals), and V. Selvaganesh (kanjira, ghatam, mridangam), who are of Indian descent. The band's name is derived from John Mclaughlin's acoustic Indian fusion band Shakti which was active in the 1970s. McLaughlin and Hussain were also members of that band, along with violinist L. Shankar and percussionists T.H. \"Vikku\" Vinayakram and R. Raghavan. The word Shakti translates in Sanskrit to \"power\" or \"goddess of power\".\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAfter disbanding in the late 1970s, Shakti enjoyed a twenty-year hiatus before McLaughlin and Hussain decided to reform the band. In addition to John and Zakir, T.H. \"Vikku\" Vinayakram (ghatam, mridangam), returned for Remember Shakti's eponymous debut UK tour and album in 1997. However, McLaughlin could not locate Shakti's original fourth member, L. Shankar, so replaced him with bansuri player Hariprasad Chaurasia for the live recording of this album.\n\nFor the band's next album, The Believer, recorded live and released in 1999, Chaurasia and Vinayakram were replaced by the late mandolin player U. Srinivas and Vinayakram's son V. Selvaganesh. The band's most recent live album, 2001's Saturday Night in Bombay, presents Remember Shakti augmented by an army of guests, notably Pt. Shivkumar Sharma (santoor), percussionist Taufiq Qureshi who is the brother of Zakir, and Shankar Mahadevan, who has now become Remember Shakti's full-time vocalist. The band has toured extensively all around the world.\n\n\n== Concert tours ==\nJanuary 2005: At the Gateway of India in Mumbai, as part of the Mumbai Festival[1]\nDecember 2006: Mumbai [2]\nFebruary 2012: Pune, Mumbai, Goa, Hyderabad, Chennai and Ramallah, Palestine as part of the Remember Shakti India Tour 2012 [3]\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Full-length albums ===\nhttps://www.allmusic.com/artist/shakti-mn0000158780/discography from 1975 to 2001\n\nRemember Shakti (1999)- Universal Records\nThe Believer (2000)- Universal Records\nSaturday Night in Bombay (2001)- Universal Records\nLive at 38th Montreux Jazz Festival, 18 July 2004\nLive at Miles Davis Hall, 8 July 1999 (Disk 16 from the John McLaughlin's Montreux Concerts Box Set, released in 2004)\nIs that So?

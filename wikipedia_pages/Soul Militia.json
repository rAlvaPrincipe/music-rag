The group consists of Lauri Pihlap (\"Lowry\"), Sergei Morgun (\"Semy\") and Kaido PÃµldma (\"Craig\"). A fourth member, Indrek Soom (\"Ince\"), left the group in 2004. 2XL was founded by Morgun and Soom in 1997. They later participated in the 2007 Estonian Eurovision preselection with a song titled \"My Place\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSoul Militia"

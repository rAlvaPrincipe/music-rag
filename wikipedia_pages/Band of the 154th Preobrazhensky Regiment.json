It is a branch of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia. The band serves the entire Moscow Region, which earned it the nickname HQ Band of the Moscow Garrison. A notable member was Konstantin Petrovich, who later served in the band of the guard of honour and the band of the defence ministry, as well as Semyon Milsyteyn, a Russian-Soviet trumpeter and former soloist in the band.\n\n\n== Brief history and activities ==\n\nThe Band of the 154 Preobrazhensky Regiment was established on June 1, 2011 on the basis of the 13th Military Band (of the HQ of Moscow Military District), which was formed back in 1940.

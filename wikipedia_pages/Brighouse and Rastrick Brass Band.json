    "text": "The Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band is a British brass band formed in 1881. The band is based in Brighouse, in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, England. The band is known across the world, and is regarded by many as the best and most consistent \"public subscription band\" in the world. They were the 2022 British Open champions, the current Brass in Concert, and Saddleworth Whit Friday champions, and were voted 2022 4Barsrest Band of the Year. The band are regarded as one of the finest brass bands in history, and are in high demand across the globe.\n\n\n== History ==\nThroughout its history, the majority of premier band championships have been held by \"Briggus\", whilst the band has also attracted a formidable reputation for highly entertaining concerts for both the general public and brass band connoisseur.\nThe band was formed over 140 years ago in 1881, through public donations given by the townsfolk of the adjacent villages of Brighouse and Rastrick, that face each other across the River Calder in West Yorkshire, England.\nToday, it still continues to be supported through public subscriptions and its own fund raising efforts. Its “amateur” members traditionally pride themselves on being financially independent, never having been beholden to any commercial interest, yet they are still regarded as one of the \"elite\" on the contest and concert platforms. \nSince January 1995, the band has practised at their purpose-built hall and music library called West Ridings at Brighouse High School on Finkil Street in the north of Brighouse.\nIn 2009 (when conducted by Richard Evans), Brighouse and Rastrick achieved \"Most Entertaining Band\" at Brass in Concert. In 2010 (when conducted by Professor David King) they won the Regional Championship in Yorkshire, regarded as the strongest region for banding in the world and the National Championships of Great Britain, a competition held at London's Royal Albert Hall, a feat replicated the following year, the Yorkshire Championship title in 2011 and the National Championship title. Along with the contest successes, followers of brass band website 4barsrest.com voted Brighouse & Rastrick and conductor David King \"Band of the Year 2011\" and \"Conductor of the Year 2011\" respectively.\nIn 2012, the band were therefore aiming for a hat trick of wins at both events, only to be pipped to second place at each. With another second placing in Yorkshire and a fourth placing at the National Finals in 2013, it has taken until 2014 for B&R to reclaim the Yorkshire title under the leadership of David King. The band's principal cornet player Stuart Lingard was awarded the \"Best Principal Cornet\" for his contribution.\nSince then, the band has had major successes across a number of contests, and has proven itself to be one of the finest brass bands in the world; while also maintaining a busy schedule of high profile performances across the UK and the globe.\n\n\n== \"The Floral Dance\" ==\n\nIn November 1977, the band reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart with their recording of \"The Floral Dance\", where they stayed for six weeks, only surpassed at the time by \"Mull of Kintyre\" (the first UK single to sell more than two million copies, and third best selling UK single of all time). It was arranged for the band by Derek Broadbent. The B-side was a version of \"Girl with the Flaxen Hair\", although some copies had a composition by Broadbent entitled \"Bachelor Girls\" as its B-side. The single also reached Number 37 on the Australian charts. The corresponding album, The Floral Dance, reached Number 10 in the UK Albums Chart. In 2016, the band performed the number on BBC One's The One Show special Terry Wogan tribute episode. The piece is still a firm favourite with audiences to this day.\n\n\n== Honours Since 2010 ==\n\n2011, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019,2023 Saddleworth Whit Friday Champions\n2022 British Open Brass Band Champions\n2022 Brass in Concert Champions\n2022 4Barsrest Band of the Year\nYorkshire Regional Champions: Winners 2010, 2011, 2014, 2019\nNational Brass Band Championships of Great Britain: Winners 2010, 2011, 2017\n\n\n== Conductors ==\nMusical Director - Professor David King\nAustralian by birth, David King has a distinguished career profile as an international conductor, instrumentalist, music educator and consultant spanning over 40 years.\nDavid King was awarded the title ‘International Brass Musician of the Year’ in 1992 and completed his Doctor of Musical Arts degree in 2000 – the first recipient of a Performance research doctorate awarded within the British university sector.

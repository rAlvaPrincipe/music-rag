    "text": "Sky was an American music trio from Detroit, Michigan, that were active during the early 1970s. They played a mixture of country rock, power pop and folk rock. \nThey released two studio albums with RCA (Don't Hold Back in 1970 and Sailor's Delight in 1971) before disbanding up in 1973 but are best known for starting the career of Doug Fieger, who would later find success as the frontman and singer of The Knack.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was formed as their members finished high school in the Detroit area and consisted of Doug Fieger (bass, lead vocals), John Coury (guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and Rob Stawinski (drums, backing vocals). Sky gained a local following after serving as an opening act for popular groups such as Jethro Tull, The Who, Joe Cocker, Bob Seger, and The Stooges. It also played with Traffic numerous times. \nThe group put out two albums on RCA, 1970's Don't Hold Back and 1971's Sailor's Delight (both produced in England by the Rolling Stones' producer, Jimmy Miller) and the low charting single \"Goodie Two Shoes\" which they performed on American Bandstand on February 27, 1971. Their sound was American rock along the lines of The Grateful Dead's then current phase, mixed with harmony and hard rock influences. Traffic also strongly influenced their style. Sky also composed and performed the soundtrack music for Roger Corman's Private Duty Nurses in 1971 (never issued as an album), and appeared in the film as Sky, the band playing at Schlumpfelder's Bar.\nThe band broke up shortly after their second album's release. It is mostly remembered today for launching the career of musician Doug Fieger, who would later move to Los Angeles and start the seminal power pop/new wave group The Knack. Coury later worked as a guitarist and songwriter on several Don Henley and Randy Meisner albums. Stawinski worked a time in the prominent British power pop band Badfinger.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nDoug Fieger – vocals, bass\nJohn Coury – guitar, keyboards, backing vocals\nRob Stawinski – drums, backing vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDon't Hold Back (1970)\nSailor's Delight (1970)\n\n\n== See also ==\nMusic of Detroit\n1970s in music\n\n\n== References =="

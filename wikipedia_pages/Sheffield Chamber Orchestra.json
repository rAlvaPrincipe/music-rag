Formed in 1950, the orchestra performs works suitable for Chamber Orchestra from the baroque to the present day. There are three concerts each year: a 'Winter Gala Concert' in late November or early December; a 'Spring Masterworks Concert' in early March; and then in May a 'Summer Festival Concert' where the orchestra is joined by local up-and-coming performers.

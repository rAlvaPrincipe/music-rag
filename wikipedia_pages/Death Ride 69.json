    "text": "Death Ride 69 was an American deathrock band formed in Los Angeles and led by Linda LeSabre (Beatmistress). The original incarnation was a duo consisting of guitarist Don Diego and vocalist Linda LeSabre. The band also featured contributions from Mark Blasquez, Ethan Port, Wrex Mock, Dave Haas and Buc Bono. They released two full-length albums, Death Ride 69 produced by Scott Arundale in 1988 and Screaming Down the Gravity Well in 1996.\n\n\n== History ==\nDeath Ride 69 was originally conceived in late 1987 by bass-drum duo Linda LeSabre and Don Diego out of Los Angeles, California. They were later joined by guitarist Wrex Mock and recorded their self-titled debut album in 1988, which contained all the tracks from their Elvis Christ EP. LeSabre reformed the band as a trio with Ethan Port, formerly of Savage Republic and Buc Bono and issued another EP titled Red Sea in 1989.\nThe band went on hiatus in the early nineties and reformed as a duo with Mark Blasquez joining LeSabre. They were signed to Fifth Colvmn Records and issued their second full-length album Screaming Down the Gravity Well in 1996. Marco Gariboldi of Fabryka called the album \"a crescendo of harsh guitars, distortions and hammering drums directed by the high and charismatic voice of Linda\" and \"a very good album by an underrated and forgotten band.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nDeath Ride 69 (Little Sister Records, 1988)\nScreaming Down the Gravity Well (Fifth Colvmn, 1996)\nEPs\n\nElvis Christ (Little Sister, 1988)\nRed Sea (Little Sister, 1989)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDeath Ride 69 on Facebook\nDeath Ride 69 discography at Discogs \nDeath Ride 69 discography at MusicBrainz"

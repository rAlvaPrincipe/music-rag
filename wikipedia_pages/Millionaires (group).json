    "text": "Millionaires is an American electronic music group consisting of Melissa Marie Green and Meredith Hurley. The group, formed in August 2007, originally consisted of Green and her sister Allison Green, as well as friend Dani Artaud. The group mix explicit lyrics with an electropop backing. Their image and lyrics generated controversy during their early years. The band released three EPs, several singles—including \"Stay the Night\", which charted for a short time in the UK, and their debut album, Tonight, released in March 2013. In 2016, they released a single with producer Wade Martin titled \"When I'm Single\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2007–2010: Career beginnings ===\nMillionaires started on August 14, 2007, (according to their Myspace signup) \"as an accident\" when sisters Melissa and Allison Green recorded a song using GarageBand. The song was titled \"I Like Money\", and the teens then created a corresponding MySpace profile named Millionaires. The third member, Dani Artaud, joined the group after Melissa Marie asked her to join. Later, they created their second song, called \"Hoe Down\".\nAt the time of their Myspace debut, they were considering releasing an EP with the title of La La Love or Girls with Guns with their GarageBand songs. They then considered the title Shit Bitch before it was released as Bling Bling Bling!. The five songs that made it to the EP were edited by Mark Maxwell; many of their Myspace songs did not make the EP.\nThey began to perform shows in California and traveled only small distances for gigs. They got spots in music festivals such as Rockin' Roots, Bamboozle Left 2008, and Audio Overload 2008. In July 2008, they went on their first tour, co-headlining with Breathe Carolina across California and other Western states. Later in July, they headlined the Get F$cked Up tour. That same month, they performed their Myspace song \"I Move It\" on MTV's TRL as part of On the Radar, a segment where popular \"hipster\" bands perform.\nThey made a short song titled \"Ooh Uh Huh\", which became the theme song for MTV's reality show A Double Shot at Love with the Ikki Twins. Their song \"Hey Rich Boy\" was also used as the theme for MTV's Teen Cribs. Their song \"Alcohol\" was also featured on the soundtrack for the third series of Skins. Their songs \"I Like Money\" and \"I Move It\" were featured on the MTV show My Life as Liz. Their cover of Chic's song \"Le Freak\" is featured on the MTV film Turn the Beat Around.\nThe band started up again in January and February 2009 on their Just Got Paid, Let's Get Laid tour, which sold out on every stop, starting in Oxnard, CA and reaching its west coast crescendo on February 23, 2009, at a small, impromptu gig for MTV's \" My Sweet 16\" bash in Capitol Hill, quickly selling out the cozy venue to die-hard fans and local residents of the hipster dominant, suburban nook of Seattle, WA. They also teamed up with UK hardcore DJ S3RL, DJ Samurai, and DJ Hook to make the Myspace single \"Martinis & Mixed Feelings\", for which an electro/techno remix was made. On June 23, 2009, they released a new EP, titled Just Got Paid, Let's Get Laid, which had three songs from Bling Bling Bling! and two new songs. During their early days the group were often wrongly cited as crunkcore but are mainly an electropop group. Their Christmas song \"Rated Xmas\" was released on December 16.\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: \"Stay the Night\", label changes and Artaud's departure ===\nThe group were signed to English record label B-Unique in late 2009, and a debut album was set for release in 2010. The single \"Stay the Night\" was released in early 2010 to promote the upcoming album and the trio embarked on two UK tours for further promotion. Stay The Night was also put forward to the BBC team to represent the UK at Eurovision 2010, but was eliminated by Pete Waterman before reaching the live decisions. The tracks \"Prom Dress\" and \"Microphone\" were released online, as well as a sample mix of the album containing snippets of unreleased tracks “That’s How We Party” and “Hush little Boyfriend” from their debut \"A Life Of A Millionaire\"\nAfter a brief period of no further promotion or updates, Dani had left the group, they were dropped by their UK label, and the planned album had been scrapped. Five songs from their MySpace that had originally been planned for the album, along with \"Stay the Night\", were released on an EP entitled Cash Only in September 2010.\n\n\n=== 2012–2014: Debut album and mixtape ===\nThe first single from their album, \"Drinks on Me\", was released on January 31, 2012, on iTunes; Millionaires then released a music video for the song. Ricky Hoover, former lead vocalist of the deathcore band Suffokate, guest starred in the video as Melissa's boyfriend.\nOn May 15, 2012, their mixtape Your Girl Does Party was released, with tracks featuring Kreayshawn, Trina, Diamond, Shanell Woodgett, Nightclub Fight Club, and Riff Raff. It was produced by Khris Lorenz.\nMillionaires released their debut album March 13, 2013, entitled Tonight, featuring 11 songs including the single \"Drinks on Me\". The album sold 697 copies in its first week. Millionaires embarked on a promotional tour for the album from April through June 2013.\nDuring the tour, they debuted three unreleased remixes: EDM remixes of \"Drinks on Me\" and \"Put It in the Air\", both produced by The Knuckledusters and a remix of \"Dat Boi\" featuring Trace Cyrus of Metro Station. Tonight received negative reviews from music critics.\nOn March 28, 2014, Millionaires released the free song \"Myspace Pic\" on their SoundCloud.

They left during episode 8, \"OG Overthrow\", following multiple confrontations with the Wallace sisters.\nOn December 18, 2015, the duo released a song titled \"When I'm Single\" with a music video directed by Wade Martin Handley.\nOn February 14, 2017, the Millionaires released the single \"Rich Girls\" for which they collaborated with Caked Up.\nOn August 14, 2022, Melissa announced that she would continue Millionaires as a solo artist due to Allison deciding to leave the group in order to focus on her work as a photographer.\nIn June 2023, Meredith Hurley & Anissa Zermeno joined the group.

    "text": "West of Eden is a folk rock band from Gothenburg, Sweden.\nThe band was formed in 1995 by spouses Jenny and Martin Schaub after they returned from a trip to Dublin, where they fell in love with Celtic folk music. They are the lead vocalists and main songwriters. Martin also plays multiple instruments, produces the albums and arranges and conducts string and brass sections. The band has released thirteen studio albums to date. Their repertoire consists mainly of original songs with influences from Irish and Scottish folk music. The sound is characterised by mostly acoustic instruments like violin, accordion and whistle. After initially being more oriented towards pop, they now fall under the genre of folk rock. In addition to Sweden, they have toured England, Ireland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and China. \nAll lyrics are in English, with the exception of the songs on the 2021 album Taube, which is  Swedish. The album contains interpretations of songs written by Evert Taube (1890 – 1976), whom is a legend in Sweden and also hails from Gothenburg.\nThroughout the years, many \"Guests of Eden\" have appeared on the albums. Notable names are (alphabetically) Ron Block, Duncan Chisholm, Steph Geremia, Jarlath Henderson, Filip Jers, Christian Kjellvander, John McCusker, Michael McGoldrick, Damien O'Kane, Kate Rusby, Heidi Talbot, but also former or future band members David Ekh, Øyvind Eriksen and Pär Öjerot appeared as a guest. In 2018, the band covered Timo Räisänens Eld & Aceton, translated into English by Jenny Schaub as Hope, Faith, Theft and performed the song with him in 2019. \nEach year West of Eden perform Christmas concerts called Celtic Christmas. Sometimes other artists join the band, like Duncan Chisholm, Triona Marshall (touring member of The Chieftains) or Heidi Talbot.\n\n\n== Current band members ==\nJenny Schaub: lead and backing vocals, accordion and tin whistle\nMartin Schaub: lead and backing vocals, acoustic guitars, tenor guitar, dobro, mandolin, bouzouki, cittern, keyboard, Hammond organ, rhodes, celesta, piano, pump organ, accordion and glockenspiel\nOla Karlevo:  drums and percussion, cajón, bodhrán and backing vocals (since the beginning)\nLars Broman: fiddle, viola and backing vocals (since 2009)\nMartin Deubler Holmlund: double bass, bass guitar and backing vocals (since 2013)\nHenning Sernhede: electric and acoustic guitars, mandolin (since 2016)\n\n\n== Former members ==\nLars Borg: bass\nLars Broman: fiddle, viola, acoustic guitar, backing vocals\nLars Dahlström: bass\nTobias Edvardson: fiddle, viola, backing vocals\nDavid Ekh: electric and acoustic guitars, dobro, e-bow, classical guitar\nØyvind Eriksen: bass\nKenneth Holmström: bass\nPär Öjerot: acoustic guitar, mandolin, octave mandolin, backing vocals\nMartin Rydman: guitar, twelve-string guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nWest of Eden (1997)\nRollercoaster (2001)\nA Stupid Thing to Do (2003)\nFour (2006)\nThe West of Eden Travelogue (2009)\nSafe Crossing (2012)\nSongs from Twisting River (2014)\nLook to the West (2016)\nAnother Celtic Christmas (2016)\nFlat Earth Society (2019)\nTaube (2021)\nNext Stop Christmas (2022)\nWhitechapel (2024)\n\n\n=== Live recording ===\nA Celtic Christmas, featuring Róisín Dempsey, Haga motettkör and Valentina Lorenz Cammans (2009)\n\n\n=== Compilation album ===\nNo Time Like The Past (2017)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nThe Kiss Tribute (2002)\nCabin Songs (2020)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nHigh Ground, taken from West of Eden (1997)\nThe One, taken from Rollercoaster (2001)\n(I Still Remember) How to Forget, taken from Rollercoaster (2001)\nFinders Keepers, taken from A Stupid Thing to Do (2003)\nAnd The Snow Fell (2007)\nGlenntown (2015)\nOld Miss Partridge (featuring Heidi Talbot & Damien O'Kane), taken from Flat Earth Society (2019)\nSilly Old Beggars (2020)\nEverywhere (Fleetwood Mac cover), taken from Cabin Songs (2020)\nSå skimrande var aldrig havet, taken from Taube (2021)\nSå länge skutan kan gå, taken from Taube (2021)\nMudlarking, taken from Whitechapel (2024)\nCatch Me When You Can, Mr. Lusk, taken from Whitechapel (2024)\nThe Ten Bells, taken from Whitechapel (2024)\n\n\n=== Jenny & Martin Schaub studio album ===\nKite High (2004)\n\n\n=== Martin Schaub studio album ===\nLeaving the Circus (2008)\n\n\n=== Martin Schaub EP ===\nPop City (2021)\n\n\n== Jenny & Martin Schaub musical ==\nIn 2021, Gothenburg celebrated its 400th anniversary.

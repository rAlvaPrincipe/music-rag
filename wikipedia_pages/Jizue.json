    "text": "Jizue (ジズー), stylized as jizue and pronounced \"Jizu\", is a Japanese instrumental jazz-fusion band from Kyoto. The band's name is taken from an alternate spelling of French soccer star Zinedine Zidane’s nickname \"Zizou\".\n\n\n== History ==\nJizue was formed in 2006 by guitarist Norimasa Inoue, bassist Tsuyoshi \"Gou\" Yamada, and  drummer Shin Kogawa. Piano player Kataki \"Kie\" Nozomiyo  joined the following year. Their music was influenced by post-rock, together with jazz, which led to their present fusion sound.\nThey have performed at large music festivals such as Fuji Rock.\nIn 2017, they were signed to Victor Entertainment.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent\n\nTsuyoshi \"Gou\" Yamada - bass guitar\nNoriyuki Inoue - guitar\nKatagi \"Kie\" Nozomiyo - piano\nPast\n\nShin Kokawa - drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nBookshelf (2010)\nnovel (2012)\njournal (2013)\nshiori (2014)\nstory (2016)\nROOM (2018)\ngallery (2019)\nSeeds (2020)\nGarden (2021)\nbiotop (2023)\nEPs\n\ngrassroots (2017)\ngnome (2022)\nLotus (2024)\nLive albums\n\nJizue Orchestra Live at Kyoto Concert Hall 2019.10.19 (2020)\nSoundtracks\n\nStars Align Original Soundtrack (Hoshiai no Sora) (2019)\nGekokujō Kyūji (2023)\nNine Border (2024)\nSingles\n\n\"Chaser/Sun\" (2011)\n\"Dance\" (2013)\n\"Christmas Comes to Our Place\" (2015 – Split with Fox Capture Plan)\n\"惑青 / 真黒\" (2015 – feat.

    "text": "The Devil Makes Three is an Americana band from Santa Cruz, California, United States. The group blends americana, folk, bluegrass, old time, country, blues, jazz, punk and ragtime music. The group's members are guitarist Pete Bernhard, upright bassist MorganEve Swain, and guitarist and tenor banjo player Cooper McBean. The band has released seven full-length studio albums and three live recordings.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2002-2009 ===\nBernhard and McBean are originally from near Brattleboro, Vermont, where they played music together as childhood friends and when they were in high school.  They were also acquainted with Lucia Turino (who was the band's original bassist and vocalist). Turino was from New Hampshire but raised in Vermont, but Bernhard and McBean didn't know her well. After graduating from high school, all three moved to California separately, Bernhard by way of Nashville.  Bernhard and McBean re-connected in Olympia.  Later in Santa Cruz they also became reacquainted with Turino, forming the band soon after in 2001.  Before forming The Devil Makes Three with Turino, both Bernhard and McBean played in punk bands and later toured as a duo.\nThe band independently released a self-titled album in 2002.  Another independent release followed in 2004, Longjohns, Boots, And A Belt.  The band recorded two shows in April 2006 in Felton, California with guest fiddler Chojo Jacques.  The recordings were later released as a live album, A Little Bit Faster And A Little Bit Worse.\nAfter the release of their live album, the band signed with independent label Milan Records, which specializes in film scores and soundtracks.  Their first album on Milan was a re-release of their debut album, The Devil Makes Three.  In 2009, they followed with an all-new album, Do Wrong Right.\nBand member Bernhard independently released a solo album, Things I Left Behind (2006).  In September 2009 Bernhard released his next solo album, Straight Line, on Milan Records.\n\n\n=== 2010-Present ===\nAround 2010, Bernhard and Turino moved back to Brattleboro. McBean remained in California and later moved to Austin. Despite no longer living in the same town, the band continued to tour and write.\nIn August 2010, the band performed at Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival. They have also performed several times at the annual Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival.\nOn June 4, 2018, The Devil Makes Three announced their new studio album, Chains Are Broken, which was produced by Ted Hutt and released on August 24, 2018, via New West Records. Along with the album announcement, they released \"Paint My Face\" as a streaming single and released another album track, \"Bad Idea\", on July 13, 2018.\nIn 2024 Lucia Turino stepped back from performing live with The Devil Makes Three, and was replaced on the road by longtime collaborator MorganEve Swain. On October 31, 2024, the band announced their first album in seven years, Spirits, set for release on February 28, 2025, via New West Records. Along with the announcement, the band premiered the title track, “Spirits”, and revealed the album's thirteen-song track listing. The album was recorded by the new trio of Pete Bernhard, Cooper Bean and MorganEve Swain (taking over from Lucia Turino on upright bass and vocals).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAllmusic artist page"

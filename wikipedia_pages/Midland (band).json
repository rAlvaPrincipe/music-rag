Midland's musical style is known as neotraditional country.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe band Midland was formed in Dripping Springs, Texas. The trio met separately around Los Angeles, where Jess Carson and Cameron Duddy were in a number of bands through a number of years. After Carson left L.A., Duddy and Mark Wystrach met and formed a country-rock band called The Young Whiskey.  The trio met up in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for Duddy's wedding in August 2013; both Wystrach and Carson acted as groomsmen. As Duddy recalls the story, Carson and Wystrach arrived in Jackson Hole for the wedding a week early. After playing songs together on the front porch of Carson's cabin, they proposed starting a project together. Six months later, in January 2014, Duddy called Carson and Wystrach to suggest that they record some songs, and they went to the Sonic Ranch recording studio in El Paso, TX to record for 10 days. As stated by Mark Wystrach, \"when we went to the Sonic Ranch, we became a band. We walked away believing in what had happened.\" Wystrach and Duddy then both  moved with their families to Texas where Carson lived. They named the band after a song by Dwight Yoakam that was called \"Fair to Midland\". \nMark Wystrach grew up surrounded by music as his parents were both fans of live music. His parents owned a country music venue. In addition to being a singer, Wystrach is also an actor and model. Wystrach was signed to IMG Models as a model. \n\nJess Carson grew up on a farm in Oregon where the main genre was country music. His sister and father were musicians, so he started playing guitar. Carson is also a singer and prolific songwriter.\n\nCameron Duddy started playing music after a difficult situation in his family; he found that music helped to lessen the tension, saying, \"Sometimes you don't get to talk about all the things that you maybe want to talk about and the ice breaker started to be music.\" He got his first guitar from his father; it helped him to find his identity.\nDuddy is also a music video director; he won an MTV Video Music Award for the music video \"Locked Out of Heaven\" by Bruno Mars.\nMidland's first song, \"Fourteen Gears\", was around 2015. The song, according to Duddy, was \"another one of the early moments that defined and solidified the band.\"\n\n\n=== 2016–present ===\nOn March 9, 2016, the trio signed to Big Machine Records and released the Midland EP featuring their debut single, \"Drinkin' Problem\", which charted on Billboard's Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay.

    "text": "The Dresdner Kreuzchor is the boys' choir of the Kreuzkirche in Dresden, Germany. It has a seven-century history and a world-wide reputation. Today, the choir has about 150 members between the ages of 9 and 19, from Dresden and the surrounding region. The boys attend the Kreuzschule in Dresden. They are also called \"Kruzianer\".\nUntil summer 2022, the director of the choir is Roderich Kreile, who is the 28th \"Kreuzkantor\" (Cantor) since the Reformation. Next Kreuzkantor will be Martin Lehmann. The Cantor between 1971 and 1991 was Martin Flämig.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe repertoire of the choir includes compositions from the early Baroque (Heinrich Schütz, Johann Sebastian Bach), the early 19th century and modern work. Several recordings are available from Berlin Classics, Deutsche Grammophon and Capriccio. The choir often performs with the Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden and the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.\nThe choir sings Vespers almost every Saturday at 5 pm and on Sunday at 9:30 am in the Church Service. Every year, they go on several concert tours in Germany, but also in Europe, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Canada, Latin America and the United States. Altogether, the choir performs about 100 times every year: 50 Church Services and Vespers, 10 concerts at their church (always including Bach's Christmas Oratorio and St Matthew Passion, and A German Requiem of Brahms), and 40 concert on tours. All in all, 150,000 people see the performances of the choir every year.\nThe Dresdner Kreuzchor has performed at the Rheingau Musik Festival several times, notably in the first season in 1988 – the Inner German border still in effect – a concert in the Marktkirche, Wiesbaden. They concluded a program of motets from the Renaissance to Bach, Brahms and Bruckner with words about peace, O Herr, mache mich zum Werkzeug deines Friedens (after the Prayer of Saint Francis), in the presence of the composer Kurt Hessenberg.\nRenowned opera houses like the Semperoper in Dresden, the Komische Oper Berlin and the Deutsche Oper Berlin have engaged members of the Dresdner Kreuzchor as soloists, for example as the three boys in The Magic Flute or as the shepherd-boy in Tosca.\n\n\n== Former choir members ==\nTheo Adam, opera singer (bass-baritone)\nClemens Bosselmann, choral conductor of the Schiersteiner Kantorei\nOlaf Bär, opera singer (baritone)\nMatthias Eisenberg, organist\nHartmut Haenchen, conductor\nRené Pape, opera singer (bass)\nMartin Petzoldt, theologian, minister, editor\nEckart Preu, conductor of the Stamford Symphony and the Spokane Symphony\nKarl Richter, conductor, organist, harpsichordist\nPeter Schreier, opera singer (tenor)\nJens Sembdner, Die Prinzen\nEckehard Stier, music director of the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra\nHans Thamm, founder of the Windsbacher Knabenchor\nWolfgang Unger, director of Leipziger Universitätsmusik\nUdo Zimmermann, composer, conductor\n\n\n== Literature ==\nKarlheinz Blaschke: Dresden, Kreuzkirche, Kreuzschule, Kreuzchor, Kruzianer – musikalische und humanistische Tradition in 775 Jahren.

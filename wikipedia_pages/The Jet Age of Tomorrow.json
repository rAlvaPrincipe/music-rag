    "text": "The Jet Age of Tomorrow (formerly The Super 3) is an American production duo from Atlanta, Georgia and a sub-group of hip hop collective Odd Future that consists of producer-singer Matt Martians, and producer-rapper Pyramid Vritra. According to Martians, the group's music originated from instrumentals turned down by Tyler, the Creator and Hodgy, who liked the tracks Martians sent them, but could not use them in their own music. Outside of their work with the Jet Age, Martians is a member of The Internet with Odd Future member Syd, while Vritra is a member of his own hip hop collective, NRK (Nobody Really Knows).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Super 3 was a production trio created by Matt Martians, which consisted of himself and fictional members Betty Vasolean and Yoshi Jankins, Jr., inspired by the virtual band Gorillaz. Publishing his beats through Myspace, Martians was eventually discovered by Tyler, the Creator and invited to join the Odd Future collective, alongside Casey Veggies, Hodgy and Left Brain, where he produced the songs \"Laxin\", \"Bubble Gum\", \"Money Talk\" and \"Our Story\" for their debut mixtape, The Odd Future Tape, released on November 15, 2008. Together with short-term member brandUn DeShay, they released The Super D3Shay EP on April 29, 2009.\nLater that year, Martians invited his friend and fellow Atlanta producer Pyramid Vritra to come to Los Angeles and join Odd Future as well. The duo eventually changed their name to the Jet Age of Tomorrow, releasing their debut EP Can I Hold Your Hand?, and both their first and second albums, Voyager and Journey to the 5th Echelon, in 2010.\nA music video for the second album's single \"Wonderland\", was released on February 4, 2011.\nVritra released his first full-length solo album, Pyramid on August 7, 2012, featuring Martians on the track \"Icecream 4 U\".\nThe duo's third album, JellyFish Mentality, was released on May 24, 2013. Four days later, the JellyFish Mentality: Bonus EP was released with four additional tracks.\nIn 2017, Martians released his debut solo album The Drum Chord Theory on January 27, and the duo released their fourth and final album God's Poop or Clouds? on September 15 on Martians new record label \"5th Echelon Jet Repair Co\". In an interview with The Fader, Martians stated that he doesn't think there will be another Jet Age album, saying \"I'm content with Jet Age — my solo albums are an extension of it now”.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nVoyager (2010)\nJourney to the 5th Echelon (2010)\nJellyFish Mentality (2013)\nGod's Poop or Clouds?

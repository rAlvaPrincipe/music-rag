    "text": "The Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra (NedPhO; Dutch: Nederlands Philharmonisch Orkest) is a Dutch symphony orchestra based in Amsterdam.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe NedPhO was formed in 1985 from the merger of three orchestras: the Amsterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, the Utrecht Symphony Orchestra Utrecht and the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra. The Netherlands Chamber Orchestra (Dutch: Nederlands Kamer Orkest, NKO) continues to give concerts under its own name, with both it and the NedPhO as part of the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra Foundation (Stichting Nederlands Philharmonisch Orkest), which is headquartered in Amsterdam. The NedPhO Foundation comprises the largest orchestra organisation in the Netherlands, with 130 musicians on staff.\nSince 2012, both the NedPhO and the NKO rehearse at the NedPho Koepel, a former church converted into a dedicated rehearsal space in eastern Amsterdam. The NedPhO gives concerts in Amsterdam at the Concertgebouw. In addition, the NedPhO currently serves as the principal orchestra for productions at Dutch National Opera (DNO). The NedPhO had given a concert series at the Beurs van Berlage until 2002, when budget cuts led to the end of that series. Since 2005-06, the NedPhO also gives a series of concerts at the Muziekcentrum Vredenburg in Utrecht.\nThe chief conductor of the NedPhO also serves as chief conductor of the NKO. Hartmut Haenchen was the first chief conductor of the NedPhO, from 1985 to 2002. He continues to work with the orchestra as a guest conductor. Yakov Kreizberg succeeded Haenchen as chief conductor of the NedPhO and the NKO in 2003, holding both posts until his death in March 2011, the year that he had been scheduled to step down from both posts. In March 2009, the NedPhO announced the appointment of Marc Albrecht as the orchestra's third chief conductor, effective with the 2011-2012 season, for an initial contract of 4 years. With Albrecht's parallel appointment as chief conductor of DNO, this arrangement allows for the NedPhO to serve as the principal opera orchestra for DNO.  In May 2016, the NedPhO announced the extension of Albrecht's contract through the 2019-2020 season.  Albrecht concluded his chief conductorships of the NedPhO and the NKO at the close of the 2019-2020 season.\nIn February 2018, Lorenzo Viotti first guest-conducted the NedPhO.  In April 2019, the NedPhO announced the appointment of Viotti as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2020-2021 season.  In April 2023, the NedPhO announced the scheduled conclusion of Viotti's tenure as its chief conductor at the close of the 2024-2025 season.\nThe Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra has made a number of recordings for Pentatone, ICA Classics, Tacet, Brilliant Classics and others.\n\n\n== Chief Conductors ==\nHartmut Haenchen (1985–2002)\nYakov Kreizberg (2003–2011)\nMarc Albrecht (2011–2020)\nLorenzo Viotti (2021-present)\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\nGustav Mahler - Symphony No. 5; Hartmut Haenchen, conductor.

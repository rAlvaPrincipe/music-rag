    "text": "TRF (an abbreviation of Tetsuya Komuro Rave Factory) is a Japanese pop band. Its members are DJ Koo, Sam, Etsu, Yu-ki and Chiharu.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band debuted as \"trf\" in the year 1993. During the period of 1994 to 1995, the band released 5 singles produced by Tetsuya Komuro, each selling over a million copies under the Avex record label. In 1995, their song \"Overnight Sensation: Jidai wa Anata ni Yudaneteru\" received a Japan Record Award.\nThe following year, the band changed their name to an all-capital \"TRF\" with their single \"Hey! Ladies & Gentlemen\".\nYu-ki has also done voice acting for a children's animation movie Elmer's Adventure: My Father's Dragon, for which she sang the opening theme song as well. She has also performed the opening song to the 2006 Tokusatsu series Kamen Rider Kabuto as well as several variants to it.\nChiharu has worked on the choreography for J-Pop singer Shizuka Kudō, and has appeared in a drama as herself.\nSam was married to popstar and protégé of Tetsuya Komuro, Namie Amuro, in 1997, who was three months pregnant with his child at the time, but the couple were divorced in 2002, due to irreconcilable differences. Amuro had full custody of their son, Haruto Maruyama.\nThe song \"Lights and Any More\" has been used as opening theme of the anime Wangan Midnight, and their song Silence Whispers has been used as the second ending theme for the anime Black Jack 21. A remix of their song, Boy Meets Girl, was used in 2000 as the first season ending theme of the anime, UFO Baby, and in 2013 was covered by the group Prizmmy as the opening theme for the series Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live.\nTRF's 20th anniversary was in February 2013. They announced that they'd be releasing something new every month, starting from November 2012.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== Remix  Single ====\n\n\n==== Digital Single ====\n\n\n=== ALBUM ===\n\n\n==== Small Album ====\n\n\n==== Remix Album ====\n\n\n==== Best Album ====\n\n\n==== Other Album ====\n\n\n=== Not released in Japan ===\n\n\n==== Single ====\n\n\n==== Album ====\n\n\n=== Video Work ===\n\n\n==== Music・Clip ====\n\n\n==== Live・Video ====\n\n\n=== TOUR ===\nCLUB TOUREZ DO DANCE\ntrf CLUB TOUR seven8 '94\ntrf TOUR '94 \"BILLIONAIRE 〜BOY MEETS GIRL\"\ntrf TOUR '95 dAnce to positive Overnight Sensation\nTRF 96 ARENA TOUR SILENT NIGHT\nTRF TOUR '98 Live in Unite!\nTRF exicoast tour '99\nTRF Lif-e-Motions TOUR 2006\nTRF 15th Anniversary TOUR -MEMORIES- 2007\nTRF 20TH Anniversary Tour\n\n\n=== Live ===\nBRAND NEW TOMORROW in TOKYO DOME 〜Presentation for 1996〜\n上海ライブ\nTRFシークレットライブ\nTRFクリスマスディナーショー\nTRFクリスマスディナーショー2008\nTRFウィンタースペシャルナイト\nTRF 25th Anniversary「THANXXX!!! 25 Best Hits LIVE & Party」\nTRF 30th Anniversary Live「THANXXX!!!

    "text": "Porgy and Bess is a recording of the Glyndebourne Festival Opera version of the George Gershwin opera of the same name. The cast were accompanied by the London Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Simon Rattle. The recording took place in February 1988 in No.1 Studio of Abbey Road in London. It was released in 1989.\nThe 1993 TV adaptation  of Porgy and Bess used this recording as its soundtrack, and featured most of the original cast of the Glyndebourne production. Bruce Hubbard, who had died in 1991, did not appear, although his singing voice was heard as Jake, while Gordon Hawkins played the role onscreen. Likewise, soprano Harolyn Blackwell's voice was heard as Clara, although Paula Ingram played the role.\nIn the opinion of many critics, this version, along with the 1977 Houston Grand Opera recording, comes closest to the original opera as conceived by Gershwin, before the cuts made prior to the Broadway premiere.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nWillard White as Porgy\nCynthia Haymon as Bess\nHarolyn Blackwell as Clara\nDamon Evans as Sportin' Life\nGregg Baker as Crown\nCynthia Clarey as Serena\nMarietta Simpson as Maria\nBruce Hubbard as Jake\nColenton Freeman as Crab-man\nWilliam Johnson as Frazier\nCurtis Watson as Jim\nCamellia Johnson as The Strawberry Woman\nThe Glyndebourne Chorus\nThe London Philharmonic Orchestra\nSir Simon Rattle, conductor\nOriginally released as EMI #7-49568-2, it was reissued as EMI #7243-5-56220-2-0 in 1997.

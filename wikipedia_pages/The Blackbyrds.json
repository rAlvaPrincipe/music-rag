    "text": "The Blackbyrds are an American rhythm and blues and jazz-funk fusion group, formed in Washington, D.C., in 1973 and reformed in 2012 by Keith Killgo.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was inspired by trumpeter Donald Byrd and featured some of his Howard University students: Kevin Toney (keyboards), Keith Killgo (vocals, drums), Joe Hall (bass guitar), Allan Barnes (saxophone, clarinet), and Barney Perry (guitar). Orville Saunders (guitar), and Jay Jones (flute, saxophone) joined later. Merry Clayton joined them to sing on \"Rock Creek Park\" and \"Happy Music\". \nThe band signed with Fantasy Records in 1973. Their 1975 hit \"Walking in Rhythm\" received a Grammy nomination and sold over one million copies by May 1975. It was later awarded a gold disc.\nFounding member Allan Barnes died on July 25, 2016, at the age of 66. Pianist Kevin Toney died from cancer on March 18, 2024, at the age of 70.\n\n\n== Sampling of Blackbyrds music ==\nThe Blackbyrds have influenced the hip-hop generation, with Tupac Shakur, Gang Starr, Da Lench Mob, and Full Force sampling their music. Their song \"Happy Music\" was issued on 45 rpm 12-inch single as the first club mix release by Fantasy Records, in November 1975, to enable club deejays to drop sequences into a mix. In particular, their 1975 song \"Rock Creek Park\" from the City Life album has been sampled by groups and artists such as MF Doom, De La Soul, Da Lench Mob, Eric B. & Rakim, Massive Attack, Heavy D, Nas, Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five, Tone Lōc, Mac Dre, and Wiz Khalifa.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n1978: Night Grooves (Fantasy)\n1989: Greatest Hits (Fantasy)\n2007: Happy Music: The Best of The Blackbyrds (Fantasy FCD-30194-2)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Blackbyrds at AllMusic\nThe Blackbyrds discography at Discogs \nThe Blackbyrds at IMDb\nD’Angelo, Enrico (June 2, 2003). \"The Blackbyrds\".

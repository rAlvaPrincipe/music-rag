    "text": "Blaqk Audio is an American electronic music duo, formed by current AFI members Davey Havok and Jade Puget under Interscope Records.\nTheir debut album, CexCells, was released on August 14, 2007, and reached number eighteen on the Billboard 200. The band's second album, Bright Black Heaven, was released on September 11, 2012, under Superball Music's imprint Big Death. The first single from Bright Black Heaven, \"Faith Healer\", was released August 14, 2012. Their third album, Material, was released on April 15, 2016, and became their third consecutive album to debut at number one on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart.\nThree additional albums, Only Things We Love, Beneath the Black Palms, and Trop d'amour were released in 2019, 2020, and 2022 respectively.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nHavok and Puget started writing music for Blaqk Audio around 2001, but they were too busy with AFI to devote enough time to the project. They returned to the project only in 2006, and the debut album CexCells was put out in August 2007.\nAFI have increasingly included synthesized elements into their recent albums; 2003 release Sing the Sorrow and 2006 release Decemberunderground credit Puget with 'programming and keyboards'. These synthesized elements are particularly apparent on songs such as \"Death of Seasons\" and \"37mm\". In the August 2006 edition of Guitar World, Puget states that AFI songs \"37mm\" and \"Love Like Winter\" were both originally intended as part of the Blaqk Audio side project. Elements of programming, however, can be found as early as 2000s The Art of Drowning, which featured a drum machine on \"The Despair Factor\".\n\n\n=== CexCells ===\nBlaqk Audio entered the studio to record several songs for their first album in January 2007. Puget kept fans apprised with updates through his blog, before the Blaqk Audio Myspace was created in February 2007. By July 27, they had filmed footage for the music video for their debut single \"Stiff Kittens\", but the video was never finished. The album, CexCells, was released on August 14, 2007. Also in 2007, Puget collaborated with the German band Tokio Hotel, contributing a remix of \"Ready, Set, Go!\" called \"Ready, Set, Go! (AFI/Blaqk Audio Remix)\" to the American version of Scream. On January 12, 2008, Puget uploaded a new song to the Blaqk Audio Myspace titled \"The Ligature\".\nInstrumental versions of the songs, \"Between Breaths\" and \"The Love Letter\" were used in trailers and on the official website for the 2008 film The Eye. In response to the buzz it created, Puget suggested at a possible public release of all the CexCells songs in instrumental form.\n\n\n=== Bright Black Heaven ===\nIn July 2009, Blaqk Audio contributed a cover of \"No New Tale to Tell\" to the tribute album for Love and Rockets, New Tales to Tell: A Tribute to Love and Rockets.\nWhile promoting AFI's new single \"Medicate\" on KROQ, Havok said that Blaqk Audio's second album was already completed, but they were focused on AFI as they felt \"if all of a sudden we're doing two Blaqk Audio records in a row people will think AFI is not happening or something.\" Puget revealed that the name of the album as Bright Black Heaven. Despite the album being finished, the band continued working on new material. Over thirty songs were recorded for the album.

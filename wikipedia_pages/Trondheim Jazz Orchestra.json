    "text": "Trondheim Jazz Orchestra (TJO) (established 1999 in Trondheim, Norway) is an orchestral project based in Trondheim, and closely related to both the Midtnorsk Jazzsenter (MNJ - Mid Norwegian Jazz Center) and Jazz Line at the Trøndelag Conservatory of Music (NTNU).\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nDuring the 1990s the orchestra was a plain conservatory-band (Konsen Big Band). In 2000 the name of the band was changed to TJO. An important feature with Trondheim Jazz Orchestra is the band's flexible and varying size crew. The orchestra works on a project basis and performs mainly commissioned works of selected composers.\nTJO has collaborated with Norwegian composers such as Erlend Skomsvoll, Eirik Hegdal, Vigleik Storaas, Jon Balke, Knut Kristiansen, Geir Lysne, Terje Rypdal and Bendik Hofseth, as well as with international soloists such as Chick Corea, Pat Metheny, New York Voices, Birger Sulsbruck and Joshua Redman.\nIn 2001 TJO toured Norway extensively with Chick Corea, a cooperation based on the concert at Moldejazz 2000. The collaboration resulted in a CD-release (Live in Molde), which has sold more than 8000 copies in Norway. The collaboration with Chick Corea was resumed in 2006 with a concert at the Hilton Ballroom in New York City during the Annual Jazz Conference (IAJE) in January of that year. This concert was a huge success, and as a result the orchestra was invited to the Tokyo Jazz Festival 2006. The cooperation between TJO and Chick Corea was successful once again and well received by a huge group of spectators while also being televised nationally. John Kelman, All About Jazz, states: \"... a far reaching orchestra clearly capable of handling anything and everything that's put in front of it\".\nIn 2003 the orchestra went on tour in Norway with Pat Metheny. This edition of TJO included musicians such as Live Maria Roggen, Ola Kvernberg and Steinar Nickelsen. On Moldejazz 2006 TJO did a project with music by Eirik Hegdal featuring Joshua Redman as a soloist, followed by a tour in the late fall of 2008. During Trondheim Chamber Music Festival TJO gave their first performance of commissioned work by saxophonist Bendik Hofseth. In 2007 Trondheim Jazz Orchestra were chosen to be the first national «Big Jazz Ensemble» to receive a permanent state subsidy. In 2012 TJO performed at the \"Ultima Festival\" in Oslo, Norway, performing a new work by Kim Myhr that, in addition to the guitarist, also featured singer Jenny Hval.\n\n\n== Honors ==\n2014: Spellemannprisen in the category Jazz, with Marius Neset for the album Lion\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2005: Live in Molde with Chick Corea (MNJ Records) – live recorded at Moldejazz 2000\n2005: We Are? with Eirik Hegdal (Jazzaway) – recorded in 2004. featuring vocalist Siri Gjære.\n2006: Tribute with Vigleik Storaas (MNJ Records) – live recorded in 2004 from 25 years anniversary for the Jazz Line at (NTNU)\n2007: Live in Oslo with Maria Kannegaard Trio (MNJ Records) – from the Cosmopolite jazz scene in Oslo. music arranged by Eirik Hegdal.\n2008: Wood And Water (MNJ Records) – 24 songs by Eirik Hegdal, with contributions by hired Siri Gjære, Nils-Olav Johansen, Ståle Storløkken, Ole Morten Vågan and Tor Haugerud\n2008: Trondheim Jazz Orchestra & Kobert (Kobert Self-Released) – studio Version of the commissioned work to Moldejazz 2008\n2009: What If?

    "text": "183 Club was a Taiwanese boyband managed by Jungiery. In other words, 183 Club is part of J-Star.  Originally they were called \"183 Yu Le Bu,\" meaning \"183 Entertainment Group,\" but it was later decided that the name should be shortened to what it is now: 183 Club.  The average height of the original five members combined is roughly 183 cm, hence the group name 183 Club.  However, it is true that only one member is actually 183 cm tall: Yen Hsing-su, the former leader of 183 Club.\nThey have acted in various Taiwanese dramas such as Magicians of Love, The Prince Who Turns into a Frog and Le Robe de Mariage des Cieux.\nThe group's Magicians of Love Original Soundtrack won Best Original Soundtrack at the 2007 HITO Radio Music Awards, presented by Taiwanese radio station Hit FM.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\n\n\n=== Former ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nMy MVP Valentine (2002)\nWestside Story (2003)\nTop on Forbidden City (2004)\nIn Love With A Rich Girl (2004)\nLe Robe De Mariage Des Cieux (Heaven's Wedding Gown) (2004)\nThe Prince Who Turns into a Frog (2005)\nThe Magicians of Love (2006)\nLegend of Star Apple (2006)\nAngel Lover (2006)\nRocks Paper Scissors (2006)\nYing Ye 3 Jia 1 (2007)\nMean Girl A Chu (2007)\nYour Home is My Home (2007)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nLa Robe De Mariage Des Cieux (Heaven's Wedding Gown) OST (2004)\nThe Prince Who Turns into a Frog OST (2005)\nThe Magicians of Love OST (2006)\nThe First Album (2006)\nAngel Lover OST (2007)\nLove Miracle 1\nLove Miracle 2\nLove Miracle 3\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Chinese)\n\n\n== References =="

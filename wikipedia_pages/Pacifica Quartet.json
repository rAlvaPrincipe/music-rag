    "text": "The Pacifica Quartet is a professional string quartet based in Bloomington, Indiana. Its members are: Simin Ganatra, first violin; Austin Hartman, second violin; Mark Holloway, viola; and Brandon Vamos, cello. Formed in 1994 by Ganatra and Vamos with violinist Sibbi Bernhardsson and violist Kathryn Lockwood, the group won prizes in competitions such as the 1996 Coleman Chamber Music Competition, the 1997 Concert Artists Guild Competition, and the 1998 Naumburg Chamber Music Competition. In 2001, violist Masumi Per Rostad replaced Lockwood. The group subsequently received Chamber Music America's prestigious Cleveland Quartet Award in 2002, the Avery Fisher Career Grant in 2006, and was named \"Ensemble of the Year\" by Musical America in 2009. In 2017, violinist Austin Hartman replaced Bernhardsson and violist Guy Ben-Ziony replaced Rostad. \nThe Pacifica Quartet tours throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia. The ensemble is known for its traversal of the complete string cycles of a single composer, and in recent years have toured and recorded the quartets of Elliott Carter, Mendelssohn, Beethoven and Shostakovich.\nCurrently the ensemble serves as Quartet-in-Residence and full-time faculty at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University in Bloomington. The members of the Pacifica Quartet are also Resident Performing Artists at the University of Chicago and were previously the Quartet-in-Residence at the University of Illinois School of Music from 2003 to 2012.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe quartet was conceived at the Music Academy of the West Summer School in Montecito, California, when fellow students, violist Kathryn Lockwood and violinist Josefina Vergara, decided they would create a string quartet for the sake of entering a competition in the Los Angeles area. Vergara invited Simin Ganatra, originally from southern California but still a student in Oberlin, Ohio, and filled in the application with the name, \"Pacifica Quartet\", having yet to hold a single rehearsal. The name came from the ocean within view of the Music Academy.  Ganatra invited cellist Brandon Vamos, who was finishing graduate school in New Haven, Connecticut, resulting in a part-time, cross-country commitment. Within a year, the group went full-time when they all moved from their respective locations to the Chicago area for post-graduate study, although Vergara soon returned to California and was eventually replaced by Sibbi Bernhardsson, establishing the first long-term iteration of the quartet. Ganatra and Sibbi Bernhardsson had both been students of well-known pedagogues Roland and Almita Vamos, whose son is Brandon Vamos, Bernhardsson having come from Iceland to study with the Vamoses. In 1997, Bernhardsson collaborated with violist Masumi Per Rostad at Yale School of Music's Norfolk Chamber Music Festival. Rostad was subsequently invited to join the Pacifica Quartet a few years later, shortly after Lockwood's departure in 2001. At the end of the 2016–2017 season, Austin Hartman replaced Bernhardsson and Guy Ben-Ziony replaced Rostad.\n\n\n== Members ==\nSimin Ganatra, violin\nAustin Hartman, violin\nMark Holloway, viola\nBrandon Vamos, cello\n\n\n== Residencies ==\nIndiana University Jacob's School of Music, Quartet-in-residence and full-time faculty members, Fall 2012 – present\nUniversity of Chicago, Artist-in-Residence of Contempo, 1999 to present\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art in NY, Quartet-in-Residence, 2009-2012\nUniversity of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, Quartet-in-residence, 2003-2012\nThe Longy School in Cambridge, MA, Visiting Artists in Chamber Music, 2006-2009\n\n\n== Exploration of Complete String Quartet Cycles ==\nThe Pacifica Quartet gained international recognition as an interpreter of string quartet cycles.

Spearheaded by Shauna Quill, Executive Director of University of Chicago Presents, the festival was inspired by the Pacifica Quartet's plan to perform all fifteen of Dmitri Shostakovich's string quartets in Chicago, the first time the city hosted the entire cycle.\nEleven different institutions collaborated to present works by visual artists, choreographers, composers, and dramatists who lived under the Politburo of the Soviet Union in more than 48 events in a dozen venues across Chicago, making it one of the largest inter-disciplinary collaborative efforts in Chicago since the Silk Road Chicago project in 2006/07. In addition to five concerts during the season, the Pacifica Quartet gave master classes and free noon-time lecture demonstrations throughout the festival.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nGrammy Award, 2021, Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance for \"Contemporary Voices\"\nNamed Ensemble of the Year by Musical America: 2009 \nGrammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance (Carter's Quartets Nos. 1 & 5): 2009 \nAvery Fisher Career Grant: 2006 \nCover of Gramophone magazine, “Five new quartets you should know about”: 2005\nChamber Music America's Cleveland Quartet Award: 2002\nAppointed members of Lincoln Center's CMS Two: 2002\nNaumburg Chamber Music Award: 1998\nConcerts Guilds Competition:1997\n\n\n== Publications ==\nPer Rostad, Masumi, “My Viola is a Porsche-More or Less,” Strings November 2011.\nPer Rostad, Masumi, “The Challenges and Joys of Quartet Playing,\" Gramophone, October 26, 2010.\nPer Rostad, Masumi, “Mortality and Meaning of Beethoven’s Late Quartet, Op. 132,\" Strings, May 2009.\nVamos, Brandon, “Never Too Late,” Gramophone, March 2009\n\n\n== Podcasts ==\nIn 2011, Boston's WGBH radio started hosting violist Masumi Per Rostad's series of podcasts, Inner Voice.

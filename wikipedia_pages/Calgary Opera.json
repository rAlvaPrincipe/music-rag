    "text": "Calgary Opera is a Canadian opera company based in Calgary, Alberta.  The company has its administrative base at the Mamdani Opera Centre, a 2,700-square-metre (29,000-square-foot) facility in the Wesley United Church, since July 2005.  The company gives its seasonal mainstage productions at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium.  During the summers of 2014 - 2017, the company presented 'Opera in the Village', the only Canadian outdoor summer opera festival.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe company was founded in 1972 as the Southern Alberta Opera Association.  The association initially performed two opera productions per year, from 1973 to 1977.  Alexander Gray was the first artistic director of the Southern Alberta Opera Association, and held the post until 1976.  In 1976, the association appointed Brian Hanson as both its general manager and artistic director.  During Hanson's tenure, the association expanded its season to three productions per season, beginning in 1978.  Hanson described his general philosophy of programming operas for the company as \"something old, something new, something light\".\nIn 1983, the Southern Alberta Opera Association officially changed its name to the Calgary Opera.  The company presented further expanded seasons of four productions in 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1988.  Hanson retired from his posts in 1988.  David Speers, previously the assistant general manager of the company, succeeded Hanson in 1988.  The company staged five operas in 1990, and four operas in 1991.  Speers concluded his tenure in 1998.\nIn 1998, W.R. ('Bob') McPhee became general director of Calgary Opera.  The company staged four productions in 2001, 2002 and 2004.

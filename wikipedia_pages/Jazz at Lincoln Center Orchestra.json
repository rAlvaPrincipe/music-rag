    "text": "Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra is an American big band and jazz orchestra led by trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. The orchestra is part of Jazz at Lincoln Center, a performing arts organization in New York City.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1988, the orchestra was formed as an outgrowth of its concert series, Classical Jazz, with David Berger conducting. When Wynton Marsalis became artistic director in 1991, he emphasized the history of jazz, particularly Duke Ellington. The first album was Portraits by Ellington (1992), and seven years later the Ellington centennial was honored with the album Live in Swing City: Swingin' with the Duke (1999).\nUnder the leadership of Marsalis, the band performs at its home in Lincoln Center, tours throughout the U.S. and abroad, visits schools, appears on television, and performs with symphony orchestras. The orchestra backed Wynton Marsalis on his album Blood on the Fields, which won the Pulitzer Prize.\nSince 2015, the orchestra's albums have been issued on its own label, Blue Engine Records.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Saxophones ===\nSherman Irby – alto saxophone, soprano saxophone, flute, clarinet\nTed Nash – alto saxophone, soprano saxophone, flute, clarinet\nWalter Blanding – tenor saxophone\nVictor Goines – tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone, clarinet, bass clarinet\nPaul Nedzela – baritone saxophone, soprano saxophone, clarinet, bass clarinet\n\n\n=== Trumpets ===\nRyan Kisor – trumpet\nMarcus Printup – trumpet\nKenny Rampton – trumpet\nWynton Marsalis – trumpet\n\n\n=== Trombones ===\nVincent Gardner – trombone\nChristopher Crenshaw – trombone\nElliot Mason – trombone\n\n\n=== Rhythm section ===\nDan Nimmer – piano\nCarlos Henriquez – bass\nObed Calvaire – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nPortraits by Ellington (1992)\nJazz at Lincoln Center Presents: The Fire of the Fundamentals (1994)\nThey Came to Swing (1994)\nBlood on the Fields (Columbia, 1997) OCLC 37265855\nLive in Swing City: Swingin' with Duke (1999)\nBig Train (Columbia, 1999) OCLC 53304940\nAll Rise (Sony Classical, 2002) OCLC 50762664\nLincoln Center Jazz Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis Plays the Music of Duke Ellington (Warner Bros., 2004) OCLC 51283882\nCast of Cats (2004)\nA Love Supreme (2005)\nDon't Be Afraid: The Music of Charles Mingus (2005)\nCongo Square (2007)\nPortrait in Seven Shades (Jazz at Lincoln Center, 2010)\nVitoria Suite (Universal, 2010) OCLC 659741065\nWynton Marsalis and Eric Clapton Play the Blues (2011)\nLive in Cuba (Blue Engine, 2015)\nBig Band Holidays (Blue Engine, 2015)\nThe Abyssinian Mass (Blue Engine, 2016)\nThe Music of John Lewis (Blue Engine, 2017)\nAll Jazz Is Modern: 30 Years of Jazz at Lincoln Center Vol. 1 (2017)\nHandful of Keys (Blue Engine, 2017)\nUnited We Swing: Best of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Galas (2018)\nUna Noche con Rubén Blades (2018)\nSwing Symphony (2019)\nJazz and Art (2019)\nJazz for Kids (2019)\nBig Band Holidays II (2019)\nSherman Irby's Inferno (2020)\nThe Music of Wayne Shorter (2020)\nBlack, Brown, and Beige (2020)\nRock Chalk Suite (2020)\nChristopher Crenshaw's The Fifties: A Prism (2020)\nBig Band Holidays III (2023)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Gilfema is a jazz trio consisting of Lionel Loueke (guitar),  Ferenc Nemeth (drums), and Massimo Biolcati (bass).\nThe name of the group comes from the musicians' names: Gil (Lionel Gilles Loueke), fe (Ferenc), ma (Massimo). They met at Berklee College of Music, coming from different backgrounds: Loueke from West Africa, Nemeth from Hungary, and Biolcati, an Italian born in Sweden.  The same members form the Lionel Loueke Trio, the difference being that the Lionel Loueke Trio plays original music written by Loueke while Gilfema offers compositions by all three musicians.\nAfter 20 years of playing together, the band is coming out with a fresh new recording in April 2020 under the collaborative moniker Gilfema again.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nGilfema (ObliqSound, 2005)\nGilfema + 2, (ObliqSound, 2008) w/ guest clarinetists Anat Cohen and John Ellis\nKaribu, Lionel Loueke Trio, (Blue Note, 2008) w/ guests Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter\nThree (Sounderscore, 2020)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGilfema Official Website\nLionel Loueke Official Website\nMassimo Biolcati Official Website\nFerenc Nemeth Official Website\nLionel Loueke (Trio) at Blue Note Records\nGilfema at ObliqSound"

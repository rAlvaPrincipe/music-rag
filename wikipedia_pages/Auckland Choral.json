It is New Zealand's oldest surviving arts organisation, and Auckland's only symphonic-scale choir, founded in 1855 and established as an incorporated society in 1914. Auckland Choral celebrated its 150th anniversary in November 2005 with a choral piece written especially for the choir by New Zealand composer David Hamilton. In 2015, Auckland Choral celebrated its 160th anniversary. The choir's current music director is Professor Uwe Grodd.\n\n\n== Auckland Choral profile ==\n\nAuckland Choral is a symphonic-scale choir of 100+ voices.

    "text": "AKB48 (pronounced A.K.B. Forty-Eight) is a Japanese idol musical girl group named after the Akihabara area in Tokyo, where the group's theater is located. AKB48 has sold more records than any other female musical act in Japanese history. AKB48's producer, Yasushi Akimoto, wanted to form a girl group with its own theater and performing daily so fans could always see them live (which is not the case with usual pop groups giving occasional concerts and seen on television). This \"Idols You Can Meet\" concept includes teams which can rotate performances and perform simultaneously at several events and \"handshake\" events, where fans can meet group members. Akimoto has expanded the AKB48 concept to several girl groups within Japan, and internationally in Mainland China, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, Philippines and Malaysia. \nAKB48 have been characterized as a social phenomenon.  They are among the highest-earning musical acts in Japan, and are the fifth-best-selling girl group worldwide. For example, their 2012 sales from record and DVD/Blu-ray releases reached $226 million, earning the group the top spot in the 2012 artist ranking. As of April 2019, the group has sold over 60 million records, including over 6 million albums. At least 35 of AKB48's singles have topped the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, with at least 30 singles selling over a million copies each, making the group the highest selling musical act in Japan in terms of singles sold. Their highest selling single, \"Teacher Teacher\", sold over 3 million in 2018 according to Billboard / Soundscan. Between 2010 and 2020, AKB48's singles have occupied at least the top two spots of the Oricon Yearly Singles Chart.\n\n\n== Concept ==\n\nAKB48 was founded as \"idols you can meet\". Japanese idols are entertainers/performers who appeal directly to fans for support. Close interactions between fans and idols allow idols to cultivate and maintain loyal fan followings.  The group's chief producer, Yasushi Akimoto, said that his goal was to create a unique idol group which, unlike other idol groups which perform occasional concerts and appear primarily on television, would perform regularly in its own theater. The AKB48 Theater is in the Don Quijote store in Akihabara, Tokyo.\nThe group is split into several teams, reducing its members' workload (since the theater's near-daily performance is by only one team at a time) and enabling AKB48 to perform simultaneously in several places. According to former member Misaki Iwasa, each team has its own theme. Team A represents freedom; Team B is idol-like, with cute costumes, and Team K has a strong, powerful image. According to an early press release, the group was intended to have 16 members on each of three teams, for a total membership of 48; but its membership has varied over time, and has exceeded 120 people. New members are called trainees (研究生, kenkyūsei) who are understudies for the group, performing occasionally in the theater as a team.\nThe group members' ages range from their early teens to over 30, and they are selected from regular auditions. Members are not allowed to date, and must be well-behaved; any violation of these restrictions is to be punished, possibly by expulsion from the group. AKB48 has a system that allows members to \"graduate\" from the group when they are older and are replaced by trainees who are promoted. Monica Hesse of The Washington Post described the AKB48 audition process as \"rolling American Idol-esque\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2005–2006: Creation and independent releases ===\nIn July 2005, Yasushi Akimoto held an audition for a new theater-based idol girl group. Of the 7,924 who auditioned, 24 were chosen as first-generation group members. On December 8, 20 members debuted as Team A in the AKB48 Theater performing \"Party ga Hajimaru yo\" (PARTYが始まるよ) to an audience of seven; attendance quickly increased. In January 2006, AKB48 cafe waitress Mariko Shinoda joined Team A as a \"1.5 generation\" member when her popularity with patrons prompted Akimoto to give her a special audition.\n\nThe group's second audition was held in cooperation with telecommunications company NTT DoCoMo in February 2006, with applicants submitting audition videos on mobile phones.  Of 11,892 applicants, 19 were selected, and 18 joined AKB48 as Team K in April. Team K performed Party ga Hajimaru yo and Team A moved to a new stage program, Aitakatta.\nAKB48 released its first independent-label single, \"Sakura no Hanabiratachi\", in February 2006. It entered Oricon's weekly Top 10 chart, with first-week sales of 22,011 (a rarity for an indie-label group). On March 31, Yuki Usami became the first member to \"graduate\" from the group. On June 7 AKB48 released its second independent single, \"Skirt, Hirari\", which sold 13,349 copies on its first day. The group made its first television appearance two days later, and signed a contract with DefStar Records (a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment) in August.\n\n\n=== 2006–2007: Set List: Greatest Songs 2006–2007 ===\n\nIn October 2006 AKB48 announced auditions for Team B, and 13 girls were chosen out of 12,828 applicants in December. The group's first DefStar Records single, \"Aitakatta\", was recorded by 20 members of Teams A and K and released on October 25. It debuted at number 12 on the Oricon weekly singles chart, selling 25,544 copies in its first six weeks, and remained on the chart for a total of 65 weeks. On November 3–4 AKB48 performed its first concert, \"AKB48 First Concert: Aitakatta ~Hashira wa Nai ze!~\" at Nippon Seinenkan in Shinjuku. The group performed \"Aitakatta\" on the New Year's Eve TV program 58th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen as a part of the \"Nihon ga Hokoru Saisentan! Special Medley\". At 43 members, the group set a program record for the most people in one group onstage simultaneously. AKB48 made its first lineup change in December, transferring Kazumi Urano, Shiho Watanabe and Natsumi Hirajima from Team A to Team B as supporting members.\nAKB48's second major-label single, \"Seifuku ga Jama o Suru\", was released on January 31, 2007 and debuted at number seven on the Oricon Top 10 chart. Its music video and lyrics hinted at the subject of enjo kōsai (compensated dating, remotely related to escort services outside Japan), triggering controversy and negative reviews. On March 18 AKB48 released \"Keibetsu Shiteita Aijō\"; debuting at number eight on the Oricon chart, it dropped to number 98 in its second week. The group's second concert, \"AKB48 Haru no Chotto dake Zenkoku Tour ~Madamada daze AKB48!~\" on March 10, had poor ticket sales.\nIn April 2007 AKB48 posted its Team B roster on its website, with five fewer members than originally announced; for the first time, its membership numbered 48. The group's fourth single, \"Bingo!\", was released on July 18. AKB48's sixth single, \"Yūhi o Miteiru ka?\", was released on Halloween 2007 and sold 18,429 copies (the least of all the group's singles).\n\n\n=== 2008–2010: Kamikyokutachi ===\n\nOn New Year's Day 2008, AKB48 released its first album, Set List: Greatest Songs 2006–2007, a collection of the group's singles and live song lists. The group's seventh major-label single (its ninth overall), \"Romance, Irane\", was released on January 23 and reached number six on the Oricon Top 10 chart in its first week.\nOn February 27, the group released its eighth major-label single, \"Sakura no Hanabiratachi 2008\", a reprise of its Team A debut single. This version featured ten members from Team A, six from Team K and five from Team B. The single's CD included a poster, and a promotion was planned in which fans who collected all 44 posters would be invited to a special event. The promotion was later canceled by DefStar Records amid concerns about possible violations of antitrust laws.\nIn June 2008, AKB48 announced plans to launch a sister group, SKE48, in Sakae, Nagoya. In August, the group moved from DefStar Records to King Records. That month Ayaka Kikuchi was the first member to be fired from the group, for \"immature behavior\" involving a leaked purikura photo of her with a boyfriend. Kikuchi returned to the group after a 2010 audition.\nOn October 22, AKB48's tenth single, \"Ōgoe Diamond\", was released on King Records' You Be Cool label. With 11-year-old SKE48 member Jurina Matsui as the single's center and cover girl, it was the first single featuring a member of AKB48's sister group and debuted at number three on the Oricon Top 10 weekly chart.\nThe group released its 11th major-label single, \"10nen Sakura\", on March 4, 2009.

AKB48's 13th single, \"Iiwake Maybe\", was released on August 26. Outselling rival SMAP's single, it reached number one on the Oricon Daily Singles Chart and number two on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart.\n\nAKB48's Team A was a guest of honor at the Japan Expo in Paris from July 2–5, 2009, performing an English version of \"Ōgoe Diamond\". The group made its U.S. debut with a show at Webster Hall in New York City on September 27.\nIn October, three AKB48 singles (\"10nen Sakura\", \"Namida Surprise!\" and \"Iiwake Maybe\") were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. Its 14th single, \"River\" released on October 21, debuted atop the Oricon Top 10 weekly chart and was the group's first number one.\nAKB48 released its 15th major-label single, \"Sakura no Shiori\", on February 17, 2010. In its first week, the single topped the Oricon chart with over 300,000 copies sold, the most by a Japanese female artist in seven years. This was the group's last single until the release of their first King Records album, Kamikyokutachi, which would top the Oricon album chart and be certified double platinum by the RIAJ for sales of over 500,000 copies.\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: Koko ni Ita Koto ===\n\nAKB48's 16th single, \"Ponytail to Chouchou\", was released on May 26, 2010.

On March 13, 2019, the group's 55th single \"Jiwaru Days\" was released, with Rino Sashihara serving as the center performer in her last single with AKB48.

On October 19, 2019, AKB48 held a concert in Taipei Arena with AKB48 Team TP.\nFollowing the assault on NGT48 member Maho Yamaguchi, the management of AKB48 faced severe public criticism. The year 2019 marked some major changes for the group, as AKBingo and AKB48 Show!, two long running nationally broadcast variety shows featuring the group, were eventually cancelled. The Akihabara-based AKB48 Cafe and Shop was closed after eight years of operation. In 2019, three regular annual events were discontinued, including the general election, according to the AKS then-board director \"because it exhausted its set purpose after its 10th iteration\". For the first time in the group's history, only two singles were released in a year. 2020 began with the announcement of plans to significantly change AKB48 management structures, with individual companies independently running each of the Japanese groups. On March 18, 2020, the group released the 57th single \"Shitsuren, Arigatō\".\nIn April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting stay-at-home order, the group launched the OUC48 project, named after the Japanese word for \"home\", o-uchi (お家), where the members perform regular stage plays from their own homes using group video chat, which is broadcast in real time via YouTube. This project is an expansion of an earlier video montage of 103 members singing \"365 Nichi no Kami Hikōki\" from their homes, personally edited into a single video by General Manager Mion Mukaichi, which was received favorably. They did not participate in the NHK's 71st Kōhaku Uta Gassen due to COVID-19.\nOn May 22, 2021, the last 1st Generation member, Minami Minegishi held her graduation concert entitled Minegishi Minami Graduation Concert ～Sakura no Sakanai Haru Wanai～ on Pia Arena MM.

During AKB48 performances, \"members perform a revue of simply choreographed routines in front of a roughly 95-percent-male audience. The music is typical Japanese pop: fast-paced numbers with high-pitched, singalong choruses.\"\n\n\n== Promotion and media ==\nAKB48 and its sister groups boost their record sales by a variety of marketing strategies. The main track for each single is recorded by a team of \"All Stars\" (選抜, senbatsu, selection) consisting of popular members from AKB48's teams and, in earlier years, its sister groups, with one of the girls selected as the center performer or Center. This creates a competitive atmosphere between members and fan groups. The singles and albums are released in different editions and types with alternate album-cover pictures, B-side tracks, video DVDs, collectible member pictures, and voting codes for several annual election contests. Record purchases come with tickets for fan meetings, including handshake events or photo sessions. Customers can choose the members they want to meet in an online pre-order system. All these strategies motivate fans to buy more than one copy of each release. Alan Swarts of MTV Japan has noted that collectors purchasing multiple copies of AKB48 CDs have inflated the market, and is one of the reasons Japan's music industry has been booming.\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nThe group has publicized special events to choose the promotional and recording lineups for some of its singles. In 2009, the concept of senbatsu sōsenkyo (選抜総選挙, \"selection general election\") was introduced, which allowed fans to vote their favorite members into the promotional line up for one of their annual singles. Ballots are obtained by purchasing the group's latest \"election single\", or, alternatively, through the group's mobile app products and fan club subscriptions. Top vote-getting members are heavily promoted, with the winner getting the centerpiece of the group's live performances of the single. The total pool of votes counted has exceeded three million votes for individual events since 2015. Fans have reportedly bought hundreds of copies of singles to vote for their favorite members.\nAnother selection method, AKB48's rock-paper-scissors tournaments, was introduced in 2010 for the group's 19th single (\"Chance no Junban\") and has recurred as an annual event. Members of AKB48 and its sister groups compete in the knockout tournament to be part of the recording and promotional lineup for the group's next single, with participants wearing a variety of costumes. Starting with 2014, the tournament does not determine the promotional line up of a single anymore. Instead, the winner would debut as a soloist or, if she was already a soloist, would perform a solo concert.\nAKB48 has also used the general election scheme to determine set lists for an annual Request Hour (リクエストアワー, rikuesuto awā) show. Other annual events include an AKB48 group only version of Kōhaku Uta Gassen and the AKB group draft meeting (AKB48グループ ドラフト会議, AKB48 gurūpu dorafuto kaigi), in which all teams from any of the sister groups chose new members from a pre-selected group of applicants.\nIn 2019, the general election, the Janken tournament, and Kōhaku Uta Gassen were not held.\n\n\n=== Documentaries ===\nFour AKB48 documentaries have been released in theaters since 2011. The first, Documentary of AKB48 – To Be Continued, was released in Japan on January 22, 2011 and on DVD in North America on December 1. The second, Documentary of AKB48: Show Must Go On Shōjo-tachi wa Kizutsuki Nagara, Yume wo Miru, was released on January 27, 2012 and earned $3,984,152 at the Japanese box office. The third, Documentary of AKB48: No Flower Without Rain: Shōjo Tachi wa Namida no Ato ni Nani o Miru?, was released on February 2, 2013 and earned $2,269,118 at the Japanese box office. The fourth, Documentary of AKB48 The Time has come Shōjo-tachi wa, Ima, Sono Senaka ni Nani wo Omou?, was released on July 4, 2014 and (as of July 13, 2014) grossed $984,757 at the Japanese box office. Each film chronicled events and issues encountered by the group during the previous year. The most recent film was Sonzai Suru Riy: Documentary of AKB48 was released on July 8, 2016.\n\n\n=== Manga and anime ===\nThe manga AKB49: Ren'ai Kinshi Jōrei revolves around AKB48, featuring group members in the story as supporting characters. The 2012 anime series AKB0048 is a science-fiction series based on the group, with production supervised by Yasushi Akimoto. Nine characters in the anime are voiced by members of AKB48 and its sister groups. First airing in Japan in the spring of 2012, a second season was broadcast in 2013.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nThe group has its own visual novel-dating sim series. In the first installment, AKB1/48: Idol to Koishitara...  (released December 23, 2010), the player engages in a relationship with one of the members. The second installment, AKB1/48: Idol to Guam de Koishitara... (released October 10, 2011, with a similar storyline) is set in Guam. The third installment, AKB1/149 Ren'ai Sōsenkyo (released December 20, 2012), expands the scenarios to AKB48 sister groups SKE48, NMB48 and HKT48. The three games were released for PlayStation Portable, with Ren'ai Sousenkyo also released for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3. In 2014 Namco Bandai developed Sailor Zombie: AKB48 Arcade Edition, as a tie-in for the television drama going by the same name, in which AKB48 members are also the main cast. In this arcade game, the player must use a light gun to shoot vaccine bullets at zombified AKB48 members. The game includes a rhythm game in which the zombie idols dance. In April 2014, a rhythm game was released for Android and iOS, in which the players select their favourite line up and may compete in various community events. In 2012, AKB48+Me was published for the Nintendo 3DS, which let the players try to become a member of AKB48. An ad for Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS also featured Miis of the group, specifically showing off member Yuki Kashiwagi and former members Mayu Watanabe and Minami Takahashi.\n\n\n=== Other media ===\n\nAKB48's producers have developed several television shows to promote the group. AKBingo!, AKB48 Show!, AKB to XX, and Nemōsu TV were variety shows. The Majisuka Gakuen series and Sakura Karano Tegami feature group members in dramatic roles. Outside the self-developed house shows, members of AKB48 have appeared in high-profile programs such as Mecha-Mecha Iketeru!, Waratte Iitomo! or SMAPxSMAP. Members frequently appear in gravure magazines. Since 2016, the streaming platform 'Showroom' collaborates with the AKB48 group and offers a steady supply of rotating group members streaming in private situations.  AKB48 will open their community on Hybe's global fan platform Weverse from April 27, 2023, their Weverse DM services will start on  May 2, and 16 AKB48 61st single's senbatsu idols will join first.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nTower Records Japan CEO Ikuo Minewaki described AKB48 as a popular act, and the group has been characterized as a social phenomenon in Japan. In 2012 AKB48 had record sales in Japan of over $226 million. Total sales of over $128 million were reported for 2013, and of over $96 million in 2015. According to Oricon, as of January 6, 2012 AKB48 sold a total of 11,787,000 singles, setting a record for \"the most singles sold in Japan by a female group\". The group's last 35 singles have topped the weekly Oricon Singles Chart. In 2010 \"Beginner\" and \"Heavy Rotation\" placed first and second, respectively, on the list of Japan's bestselling singles of the year; From 2010 to 2019,  AKB48's singles have occupied at least the top two, and sometimes the top four or five spots of the Oricon Yearly Singles Chart. As of June 2018, the group has sold over 60 million records, including over 6 million albums.  AKB48 is the highest selling musical act in Japan in terms of singles sold. However, AKB48's 42nd single \"Kuchibiru ni Be My Baby\" failed to sell more than one million copies in the first week after its release, ending a run of single releases achieving this feat, starting with \"Everyday, Katyusha\" in 2011.\nBeside CD sales, AKB48 enjoys commercial success in other areas as well. The group has six singles certificated by RIAJ for reaching a million downloads each. According to Joysound, AKB48 has been named the karaoke artist of the year for four years in a row (2011–2014). In 2011, eight positions of annual top 10 photobook sales were occupied by group members. In 2012, six members topped the individual rankings of advertisement campaigns. AKB48 is also one of the most viewed Japanese artists on YouTube.\nAKB48 holds several Guinness World Records, including being recognized on December 1, 2010, as the \"largest pop group\" when it numbered 48 members. It set a record for \"most same-product television endorsements within 24 hours\" on February 28, 2012, after 90 group members appeared in 90 different commercials aired in the Kanto, Kansai and Tokai regions of Japan. Japanese ambassador to the United States Ichirō Fujisaki, on meeting the group during its visit to Washington, D.C., said that \"AKB\" stood for \"adorable, kind and beautiful\". On February 1, 2012, Japan Post issued a stamp commemorating the group.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nOne of the group's risqué music videos has been considered controversial. \"Heavy Rotation\"'s video was criticized by Western reporters for showing AKB48 members in lingerie and underwear, hugging, kissing and sharing a bath. Its director, Mika Ninagawa, said that she wanted to appeal to men and women with a creative, fun video because of the group's increasing popularity among girls. In an interview, she accepted responsibility for its content: \"Mr. Akimoto left everything to me. He did not give me any tips at all...I tried to show how AKB48 is in real life, in the video. In the dressing room, they seemed very close to each other. Then I came up with the concept [of a] girls' high school.\"\nIn February 2013 group member Minami Minegishi, had her head shaved and appeared in a YouTube video to apologize after it was reported by a tabloid that she had spent the night with a man in violation of her contract; she was demoted to the status of trainee. Although her shaved head was self-inflicted in an apologetic response to her fans and peers for her demotion, it was seen as an overreaction and attracted criticism of how the situation was handled.\nA 2016 NHK documentary reported that the popularity of AKB48's handshake sessions may contribute to the decline of romantic relationships among young Japanese people, including \"herbivore men\", which triggered debates. According to the report, some fans would rather spend their time supporting their favourite idols than actively pursuing love interests.\n\n\n== Theater ==\n\nThe AKB48 Theater (AKB48劇場) is a live performance venue created especially for performances by AKB48, based around the concept of AKB48 being “idols you can meet”. The AKB48 Theater is located on the 8th Floor of the Don Quixote Akihabara Building in Kanda, Chiyoda City, Tokyo. The Theater has a capacity of 250 people (including standing audience members); the seats are located very close to the stage. Performances by the different AKB48 teams and by AKB48 trainees are held on a more or less daily basis, and the Theater is very popular with AKB48's enthusiastic fans.\nAKB48 Theater had been temporarily closed for several reasons over the years, most recently due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cafeteria & shop were open inside the theater since 2011, however they both closed after 8 years.\nThe current theater manager is Hiroshi Yuasa, and Shinobu Kayano is General Theater Manager of all 48 Groups.\nTo celebrate Atsuko Maeda's graduation from AKB48, a photo mosaic was created with 10,000 pictures sent by fans. The poster was displayed at AKB48 Theater between August 27 through September 3.\nAKB Theater Anniversary is coincide with AKB48 Anniversary.\nOn 17 March 2024, it was announced that after 19 years of operations, the theatre will undergo renovations from September, with the last performance at the current theatre to be held on 1 September 2024.

On March 8, 2013, the group released \"Tenohira ga Kataru Koto\", another song dedicated to the March 2011 disaster victims, on its website for free digital download. On the second anniversary of the disaster AKB48 and its sister groups visited the affected areas, performing at schools and the AKB48, SKE48, NMB48 and HKT48 theaters with proceeds aiding the ongoing recovery.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nAKB48's line up has frequently changed due to departures, admissions, team rotations, and transfers between AKB48 and its various sister groups.  As of December 5, 2024, the group consists of 42 active members, including 29 Official members and 13 Trainees who initially serve on specific teams as understudies until they are promoted. Some sister group members have held concurrent positions with AKB48 in the past, however, the practice has ended and since 2018, no sister group member has held a concurrent position with AKB48. Narumi Kuranoo is the current general manager of AKB48 and its sister groups.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nKoko ni Ita Koto (2011)\n1830m (2012)\nTsugi no Ashiato (2014)\nKoko ga Rhodes da, Koko de Tobe!

    "text": "The Bournemouth Sinfonietta was a chamber orchestra founded in 1968 as an offshoot of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. It was disbanded in November 1999 after increasing difficulties in obtaining funding from local councils led to the decision to concentrate government funding on its larger parent.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe orchestra was initially conducted by George Hurst, who acted as artistic adviser, and Nicholas Braithwaite, to perform the classical repertoire in the smaller venues of the south and west of England. In the first months of its existence, players interchanged between the Symphony Orchestra and the Sinfonietta, with some having to consult a chart to find out which orchestra they would play with the following week (leading occasionally to players going for the wrong rehearsal). The 'pool of players' idea was scrapped and the Sinfonietta became independent of the BSO, with more players moving across from the BSO in 1969.\n\n\n== Concert repertoire ==\nThe Sinfonietta made its London debut on 9 January 1969 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in a concert of Seiber, Milhaud, Webern and Varèse conducted by Edgar Cosma.\nAmong the premières given by the orchestra were:\n\nDuring its existence, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta gained a national reputation, appearing at The Proms in 1977, 1988 and 1992 and also undertook short overseas tours, including Germany in 1987; Italy and Turkey in 1992; Romania in 1994; Spain in 1995; Brazil in 1996; and France in 1997. Venues in the south and west of England varied from small church halls, often in places which would otherwise hear no live professional orchestral music, to larger concert halls. From 1974 until 1986, the Sinfonietta was the orchestra for Glyndebourne on Tour.\nThe educational and outreach work of the Sinfonietta was recognised by a Prudential Award and a Sainsbury's \"Arts for All\" award. In Romania, in collaboration with the charity, 'Musika in Romania', the orchestra gave concerts, visited schools, an orphanage and an assessment centre for street children.\n\n\n=== Bournemouth Sinfonietta Choir ===\nThe Bournemouth Sinfonietta Choir was founded in 1972 and continues to give concerts in Dorset and beyond. The Choir's director in 2008 was David Gostick, organist at Wimborne Minster.\n\n\n== Principal conductors ==\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nAmong the many recordings made by the Orchestra, ranging from the Baroque to the contemporary, are:\n\nRecording venues included Southampton Guildhall, Christchurch Priory, Poole Arts Centre (The Lighthouse) and the Bournemouth Winter Gardens.\n\n\n== References =="

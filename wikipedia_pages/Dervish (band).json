    "text": "Dervish is an Irish traditional music group from County Sligo, Ireland which has been described by BBC Radio 3 as \"an icon of Irish music\". They were formed in 1989 by Liam Kelly, Shane Mitchell, Martin McGinley, Brian McDonagh, and Michael Holmes and have been fronted by singer Cathy Jordan since 1991. They represented Ireland in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, singing a song written by John Waters and Tommy Moran. In 2019 they released an album on the US Rounder Records label called The Great Irish Song Book featuring a selection of classic Irish songs sung by a number of well known singers including Steve Earle, Andrea Corr, Vince Gill, Kate Rusby, Imelda May, Rhiannon Giddens, The Steel Drivers, Brendan Gleeson, Abigail Washburn, and Jamey Johnson. In 2019 they received a lifetime achievement award from the BBC.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was originally called The Boys of Sligo; an album under this title, with Martin McGinley on fiddle, and with no vocals, was released by Sound Records (SUN CD1).\nIn 1991 the band were joined by Roscommon-born singer Cathy Jordan and fiddle player Shane McAleer. Dervish's first album, Harmony Hill, was released in 1993. In 1994 their second album, Playing with Fire, was released. In 1996 Dervish released At the End of the Day.\nTheir fourth album, Live in Palma, was recorded in front of a live audience in 1997. In 1998 McAleer left the band and was replaced by Sligo musician Séamie O'Dowd and fiddle player Tom Morrow. Dervish's fifth album, Midsummer's Night, was released in 1999.  In 2001 Dervish released Decade, a compilation of tracks from their first five albums. In 2003 they released Spirit, followed by A Healing Heart in 2006.\n\nEurovision Song Contest 2007\nDervish performed as the Irish entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. They finished last (with five points which were awarded to them by the Albanian back-up jury because of a failed televote), for their performance of \"They Can't Stop The Spring\".\n\n2012 Boycott of Israel\nIn the Spring of 2012, Dervish was one of two Irish bands that canceled heavily advertised concerts in Israel citing a cultural boycott of Israel. The band's lead vocalist, Cathy Jordan, stated \"it was very naïve of me to think our motives would not be misunderstood and misrepresented. So much so it started an avalanche of negativity which has made it impossible for us to make the trip regardless of our motives.\" Jordan added that \"Although I was aware of the concerns with our proposed visit to Israel, I wasn’t quite prepared for the extent of the venom directed at us.\" Irish Justice Minister Alan Shatter accused the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC) of \"cyberbullying\" Dervish into withdrawing from the concerts. IPSG National co-ordinator Kevin Squires stated that the organization had directed its supporters to target Dervish's website, although he denied Jordan's claim that there was any \"venom\" directed towards the band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Boys of Sligo (1989)\nPaddy's Trip to Scotland/The New Rigged Ship/Larry Redican's Bow\nThe Dolphin/The Clapton Jigs\nThos Byrnes/The Man Of Aran\nJackson's/The Cliffs of Glencolumbkille\nThe Sligo Set: Martin Wynne's/Lad O’Beirne's/McDermott's\nThe Raphoe Reel/The Chestnut Tree\nThe Boys Of Sligo/Monaghan Twig\nThe World's End Set\nEddie Kelly's Jigs\nUnknown Reel/Return From Camden Town\nThe Key Of The Convent/Tommy People's Reel\nThe Dancing Bear/Oreaga\nWalsh's Fancy/The Congress/Spoil the Dance\nHarmony Hill (1993)\nApples in Winter\nHills of Greenmore\nThe Green Fields of Miltown\nBellaghy Fair\nThe Ploughman\nThe Green Mountain\nWelcome Poor Paddy Home\nJig C Jig\nThe Fair Maid\nVirginia Set\nA Stór Mo Chroí\nSlides & Reels\nPlaying with Fire (1995)\nBuckley's Fancy\nMolly And Johnny\nLast Nights Fun\nWheels Of The World\nMaire Mor\nI Buried My Wife\nThe Hungry Rock\nCailin Rua\nAsh Plant Set\nPeigin Mo Chroi\nThe Game Of Love\nWillie Lennox\nLet Down The Blade\nAt the End Of The Day (1996)\nTouching Cloth (Reels)\nAr Éirinn Ní Neosfainn Cé Hí (Song)\nJim Coleman's (Mazurka & Reels)\nAn Spailpín Fánach (Song)\nPackie Duignan's (Jigs)\nLone Shanakyle (Song)\nDrag Her Round The Road (Reels)\nPeata Beag (Song)\nThe Trip To Sligo Set (Reels)\nSile Ni Ghadhra (Song)\nThe Kilavill Set (Jigs)\nI Courted A Wee Girl\nJosefin's Waltz (Dervish & Väsen)\nEileen McMahon\nLive in Palma (1997)\nPackie Duignan's (Jigs)\nAn Spailpín Fánach (Song)\nSlow Reels\nSheila Nee Iyer (Song)\nThe Trip To Sligo (Reels)\nThe Hungry Rock\nAr Éirinn Ní Neosfainn Cé Hí (Song)\nMolly And Johnny (Song)\nThe Green Mountain\nI Courted A Wee Girl/Josefin's Waltz (Song)\nDrag Her Round The Road (Reels)\nMáire Mhór (Song)\nI Buried Me Wife and Danced On Top Of Her (Jigs)\nThe Hills Of Greanmore (Song)\nThe World's End (Reels)\nPeata Beag (Song)\nPheigín Mo Chroi (Song)\nJim Coleman's (Muzurka and Reels)\nHappy Birthday To Felip\nEdward by Lough Éirn's Shore (Song)\nKillavil Jigs\nAllelu na Gnamha\nMidsummer's Night (1999)\nMidsummer's Night\nSeán Bháin\nTenpenny Bit\nThe Banks of Sweet Viledee\nPalmer's Gate\nÉrin Grá mo Chroí\nLark on the Strand\nCairns Hill\nThere was a Maid in her Father's Garden\nAbbeyfeale Set\nAn T-Úll\nBold Doherty\nOut on the Road\nRed-haired Mary\nDecade (2001)\nThe Kilavill Set\nMolly and Johnny\nThe Lark on the Strand\nThe Hills of Greanmore\nThe Worlds End\nApples in Winter\nPeigín mo chroí\nJosefin's Waltz\nAn Spailpín Fánach\nThe Hungry Rock\nThe Banks of the Sweet Viledee\nPalmer's Gate\nAr Éirinn Ní Neosfainn Cé Hí\nJim Coleman's\nSpirit (2003)\nJohn Blessings\nAn Rógaire Dubh/Na Ceannabháin Bhána/Páidín O Raifeartaí\nFather Jack\nFair-Haired Boy\nSiesta Set\nSoldier Laddie\nBeauties of Autumn\nThe Lag's Song\nBoots of Spanish Leather\nO'Raghailligh's Grave\nSwallows Tail\nThe Cocks Are Crowing\nWhelans: Trounsdells Cross, Whelans\nA Healing Heart (2005)\nI Courted a Wee Girl / Josefin's Waltz\nA Stór Mo Croí\nBoots of Spanish Leather\nWillie Lennox\nErin Grá mo Chroi\nAr Éirinn Ní Neosfainn Cé Hí\nThe Fairhaired Boy\nLone Shanakyle\nI Hope You Still Dance\nJosefin's Waltz\nTravelling Show (2007)\nGypsies, Tramps and Thieves\nThe Coolea Jigs\nMy Bride and I\nThe Cat She Went A-Hunting\nThe Bealtine Set\nGrainne\nHeading Home\nThe Queen and The Soldier\nThe Masters Return\nLord Levett\nThe Jolly Tinker\nCrucan Na bPaiste\nThe Thrush in the Storm (2013)\nThe Green Gowned Lass\nBaba Chonraoí\nMaggie's Lilt\nThe Lover's Token\nThe Rolling Wave\nShanagolden\nThe Corner House\nThe Banks of the Clyde\nHandsome Polly-O\nHarp and Shamrock\nSnoring Biddy\nThe Thrush in the Storm\nCelebration!! 1989-2014 (2014)\nMidsummer's Night\nSnoring Biddy\nThe Coolea Jigs\nBold Doherty\nKillavil Jigs\nThe Ploughman\nMaggie's Lilt\nCailin Rua\nPackie Duighnan's\nBoots of Spanish leather\nBuckley's Fancy\nLord Levett\nThe Swallow's Tail\nRed Haired Mary\nWelcome Poor Paddy Home\nThe Great Irish Song Book (2019)\nThe Rambling Irishman\nThere's Whiskey in the Jar\nMolly Malone\nThe Galway Shawl\nShe Moved through the Fair\nThe Rocky Road to Dublin\nDown by the Sally Gardens\nOn Raglan Road\nDónal Óg\nThe Fields of Athenry\nThe May Morning Dew\nThe West Coast of Clare\nThe Parting Glass\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nNeal Walters & Brian Mansfield (ed.)

    "text": "Blue in Heaven were an Irish rock quartet from Churchtown, Dublin, active from 1982 to 1989 and led by singer Shane O'Neill. They reformed in 1990 as The Blue Angels. O'Neill later went on to form Supernaut with Dave Long from Into Paradise.\nBlue in Heaven released a few singles on U2's Mother Records before being signed to Island Records in 1985, when they released their first album, All The Gods Men, which was produced by Martin Hannett.\nTheir follow-up, Explicit Material (1986), saw them team up with Island Records chief Chris Blackwell and Eric Thorngren. Their popularity grew thanks to touring with The Chameleons, Echo & the Bunnymen, and The Damned, alongside achieving a minor  hit with \"I Just Wanna\".\nKieran Kennedy joined and they played concerts for two years. They released an EP on the Solid label, Rock 'n' Roll R.I.P., which was a chronological compilation of their work: a 1983 track (\"On and On\") produced by The Edge, four from 1987 and a live cover of The Stooges's song \"Loose.\" Kennedy left to start the Black Velvet Band.\nAt a concert in Dublin's Baggot Inn in August 1991, they were supported by David Bowie's band Tin Machine. \n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Original recording members ===\nDrums - Dave Clarke (later played drums for The Black Velvet Band, Warren Zevon, and currently, for Hothouse Flowers)\nBass - Declan Jones\nGuitar, keyboards, vocals - Shane O'Neill\nGuitar, keyboards - Eamonn Tynan\n\n\n==== Supernaut ====\nIn 1997, O'Neill played mostly rhythm electric and acoustic guitar and bass, and sang and wrote words and music with Dave Long, from Into Paradise.

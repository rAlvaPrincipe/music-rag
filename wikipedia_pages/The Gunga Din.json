    "text": "The Gunga Din was an American rock band formed in 1998 in New York City. The band featured vocalist Siobhan Duffy, guitarist/vocalist Bill Bronson, bassist Chris Pravdica, drummer Jim Sclavunos, and keyboardist Maria Zastrow. They released two albums, Introducing: The Gunga Gin and Glitterati, in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The members came from diverse musical background, having played in the bands such as God Is My Co-Pilot, Swans, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.\nDescribed as a \"New York-style art rock band,\" The Gunga Din combined a Farfisa organ with psychedelic music-inspired drumming. Their debut album was characterized as \"an equal blend of post-punk and new wave\" with occasional psychobilly influences and drew comparisons to the works of bands like the Doors, X and Suicide. The band's second studio album also drew comparisons to the works of PJ Harvey and The Velvet Underground.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nSiobhan Duffy – vocals, drums\nBill Bronson – guitar, vocals\nChris Pravdica – bass guitar\nJim Sclavunos – drums\nMaria Zastrow – keyboards\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nIntroducing: The Gunga Din (1999)\nGlitterati (2000)\nOther releases\n\nYour Glitter Never Dulls (2000)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Gunga Din discography at Discogs"

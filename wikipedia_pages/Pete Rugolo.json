    "text": "Pietro Rugolo (December 25, 1915 – October 16, 2011), known professionally as Pete Rugolo, was an American jazz composer, arranger, and record producer.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nRugolo was born in San Piero Patti, Sicily. His family emigrated to the United States in 1920 and settled in Penngrove, California. He began his career in music playing the baritone horn, like his father, but he quickly branched out into other instruments, notably the French horn and the piano. He received a bachelor's degree from San Francisco State College and then went on to study composition with Darius Milhaud at Mills College in Oakland, California, and earn his master's degree.\nAfter he graduated, he was hired as an arranger and composer by guitarist and bandleader Johnny Richards. He spent World War II playing with altoist Paul Desmond in an Army band. After the war, Rugolo worked for Stan Kenton. He and songwriter Joe Greene collaborated on songs that made Kenton's band one of America's most popular.\nWhile Rugolo continued to work occasionally with Kenton in the 1950s, he spent more time creating arrangements for pop and jazz vocalists, most extensively with former Kenton singer June Christy on such albums as Something Cool, The Misty Miss Christy, Fair and Warmer!, Gone for the Day, and The Song Is June!\nDuring this period, he worked on film musicals at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and in the late 1950s he served as an A&R director for Mercury Records. Among his albums were Adventures in Rhythm, Introducing Pete Rugolo, Rugolomania, An Adventure in Sound: Reeds in Hi-Fi, and Music for Hi-Fi Bugs. Rugolo's arrangements for the album The Four Freshmen and Five Trombones propelled the group to recognition in jazz circles. It was their bestselling album.\n\n\n== Television and film scoring ==\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Rugolo did a great deal of work in television, contributing music to a number of series including Leave It to Beaver, Thriller, The Investigators, The Thin Man, Checkmate, The Fugitive, Run for Your Life, Felony Squad, The Bold Ones: The Lawyers, Alias Smith and Jones, and Family.\nHe provided scores for a number of TV movies and a few theatrical films, such as Jack the Ripper (1959), The Sweet Ride (1968), Underground Aces (1981), and Chu Chu and the Philly Flash (1981).\nIn 1962, he released an album of themes from popular television series, TV's Top Themes, which included his composition for the 1961 CBS sitcom Ichabod and Me. Rugolo's small combo jazz music featured in a couple of numbers in the film Where the Boys Are (1960) under the guise of Frank Gorshin's \"Dialectic Jazz Band\".\n\n\n== Death ==\nRugolo died at the age of 95 on October 16, 2011, in Sherman Oaks, California.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nIntroducing Pete Rugolo (Columbia, 1954)\nAdventures in Rhythm (Columbia, 1955)\nRugolomania (Columbia, 1955)\nMusic for Hi-Fi Bugs (EmArcy, 1956)\nOut on a Limb (EmArcy, 1956)\nNew Sounds by Pete Rugolo (Harmony, 1957)\nAn Adventure in Sound: Reeds in Hi-Fi (Mercury, 1958)\nAn Adventure in Sound: Brass in Hi-Fi (Mercury, 1958)\nPercussion at Work (Mercury, 1958)\nRugolo Plays Kenton (EmArcy, 1958)\nThe Music from Richard Diamond (EmArcy, 1959)\nBehind Brigitte Bardot (Warner Bros., 1960)\n10 Trombones Like 2 Pianos (Mercury, 1960)\nThe Original Music of Thriller (Time, 1961)\nTen Trumpets and 2 Guitars (Mercury, 1961)\n10 Saxophones and 2 Basses (Mercury, 1961)\nTV's Top Themes (Mercury, 1962)\n\n\n=== As conductor/arranger ===\nWith Nat King Cole\n\n\"Lush Life\" (Capitol, 1949)\nThe Nat King Cole Trio Vol. 4 (Capitol, 1949)\n\"Frosty the Snowman\" (Capitol, 1950)\n10th Anniversary Album (Capitol, 1948–1953 [1955])\nThe Nat King Cole Story (Capitol, 1961)\nWith June Christy\n\nSomething Cool (Capitol, 1955)\nThe Misty Miss Christy (Capitol, 1956)\nFair and Warmer!

Their song \"Spunk\" was used as the theme song for the first three seasons of Queer as Folk, and was included on original TV soundtrack album for the show.\nPyle and Zealley also composed the scores to several films by John Greyson (including Proteus, The Law of Enclosures and the short films This is Nothing and Herr), Sarah Polley (I Shout Love) and Wrik Mead (Fruit Machine, Hoolboom, Camp).

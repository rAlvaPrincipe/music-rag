In the past, idols were limited to appearing in music shows and dramas. She actively promoted SMAP members to appear on variety shows and perform with comedians to increase their name recognition among the general public, and succeeded in developing SMAP into a popular group. After Kis-My-Ft2 debuted, she became the manager in charge of the group and used the same method to make them focus on variety shows. In the beginning, members of Kis-My-Ft2 often appeared as guests on programs in which SMAP appeared. SMAP and Kis-My-Ft2, led by manager Iijima, were called the \"Iijima team\" by the mass media at the time, and were often compared to other groups such as Arashi, managed by vice president Julie Keiko Fujishima. The members of Kis-My-Ft2 gained experience in working with SMAP and in variety shows such as their show \"Hamakiss,\" which led to more TV appearances.\nIijima later had a falling out with Yasuko Mary Kitagawa, sister of Johnny & Associates president Johnny Kitagawa, and left the company in 2016, and SMAP disbanded that same year. Although the manager in charge changed and SMAP disbanded, the relationship between Kis-My-Ft2 and SMAP members, especially Masahiro Nakai, has continued since then. Members of Kis-My-Ft2 have continued to appear on TV shows hosted by Masahiro Nakai who is an active individual.\n\n\n==== \"Front three\" and \"Back four\" ====\nIijima is known as SMAP's astute manager, but for Kis-My-Ft2, her sales techniques are controversial. She actively promoted Yuta Tamamori, Taisuke Fujigaya, and Hiromitsu Kitayama, known as the \"front three,\" to raise awareness of their seven-member group. In music videos, the \"front three\" and the \"back four\" wore different colors of costumes, and the \"back four\" sometimes wore black costumes like the back dancers. The \"back four\" were not treated well, and even in music shows they were forced to wear modest costumes and sometimes were made to dance behind the trainees who danced in the background. Compared to the \"front three\" who continued to star in dramas, they had little individual work. SMAP member Masahiro Nakai took notice of the \"back four\" in this situation and he himself produced and formed a group called Busaiku. Now that Iijima has left, this blatant difference in treatment had gradually disappeared, but the members do not speak fondly of those days, referring to them as the \"disparity era\". This distinction between the \"front three\" and \"back four\" costume colors would remain for some time, and can be seen until the music video for the 20th single, Red fruits, released in November 2017.\n\n\n=== Variety show on TV Asahi ===\nSince their debut, they have appeared in many so-called physical variety shows, including Hama Kiss.\nHama Kiss is a TV Asahi late-night show in which members who have just debuted apprentice themselves to popular veteran comedian Masaru Hamaguchi and learn the ropes of variety shows. The show's selling point was its physical projects, and Kis-My-Ft2 members tried out one project after another, which was unlike those of idols. One example of a harsh project was a project where seven people had to eat 1,000 rice crackers. They were forbidden to eat anything other than crackers, which varied in size and hardness, and some of the crackers were so hot that they found it hard to keep eating, with some members starting fights, cutting the inside of their mouths and swelling their cheeks. Other projects included getting face close to a crocodile, eating insects and bungee jumping while filming. The programme began on 29 December 2011 on an irregular basis and became a regular programme on 4 April 2012. The show became so popular that the name of the programme was then changed, but the programme by Kis-My-Ft2 and Masaru Hamaguchi continued until September 2014. After that, Kis-My-Ft2 programme continued on TV Asahi. Since October 2017, the partners have been the comedy duo Sandwichman. The program included a project in which Kis-My-Ft2 members would buy 100,000-yen Lottery tickets and examine each one to see if it was a winner on the day of the event, sometimes winning a large sum. The program gained popularity and air in primetime from April 2019 as Can we do it for 100,000 yen?.\n\n\n=== Kis-My-Busaiku!? ===\nTheir namesake variety show Kis-My-Busaiku!?, which program has been broadcast irregularly since 2012, began regular broadcasting on Fuji TV from April 2013. Busaiku means \"ugly\" or \"not so cool\". When they first debuted, a search for their group name showed the negative word \"Busaiku\" in the search engine's predictions. This is where the name of the programme came from. This was also unusual for an idol at the time. In this program, members of Kis-My-Ft2 come up with \"words and gestures that women think are cool,\" perform them in various romantic situations, have women rate them, and rank them. The cool lines they came up with were sometimes harshly criticized or laughed at mercilessly by the women, and because this was a rare project for an idol variety show at the time, it became a popular program. The programme changed its airtime to late night in 2017, but continued until Hiromitsu Kitayama's departure in September 2023.\n\n\n== Group activities ==\n\n\n=== TV Variety show ===\n\n\n==== Regular appearances by the group ====\n\n\n==== NHK ====\nThe Shounen Club (2005 – 2012, NHK BS Premium) – until the 5 August 2011 episode, the members appeared under the name of Johnny's Jr.\nThe Shounen Club Premium (April 2019 – March 2023, NHK BS Premium) – MC\n\n\n==== TV Asahi ====\nHama Kiss (one-off: 29 December 2011 and 23 March 2012, regular: 4 April – 26 September 2012)\nKiss Hama Learning / Kiss Hama Learning 2 / Kiss Hama Learning 3 (3 October 2012 – 26 March 2014)\nKiss Hama TV (1 April 2014 – 24 September 2014)\nKis-My-Ft2 presents Office Learning Variety OL Club (30 September 2014 – 25 March 2015)\nUpgrading that game!

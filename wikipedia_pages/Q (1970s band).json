The group featured two members from Jaggerz, a hit-making group from the early 1970s. The title track from the album was released as a single and was successful in the US, becoming a Top 40 hit.\n\n\n== Commercial success ==\nQ released a single, titled \"Dancin' Man,\" in Spring 1977 (the B side was entitled \"Love Pollution\"); spurred on by regional airplay and a full-page ad taken out in Billboard magazine, the single became a Top 30 hit in the US, peaking at number 23. In the UK, though not a national hit, in London the song reached number 8 on Capital Radio's 'Capital Countdown' Top 40 in May 1977.\nQ's debut album, also titled \"Dancin' Man,\" was less successful, reaching #140 on the Billboard 200. The group's second single, \"Sweet Summertime,\" stalled out at number 107 in the US, essentially rendering the group a one-hit wonder.\n\n\n== Members ==\nDon Garvin - guitar, vocals\nRobert Peckman - bass, vocals\nBill Thomas - keyboards, vocals\nBill Vogel - drums, vocals\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nQ -Pittsburgh Music History Archived 2013-09-28 at the Wayback Machine"

The duo has played at events around the world, including Ultra Music Festival, Tomorrowland, Global Gathering, and Luminosity Beach Festival.

They have also signed other Egyptian trance DJs such as Philippe el Sisi, Mohamed Ragab, and Brave and in late 2010 the label merged with the Armada roster.\nOn their debut album, Rising Sun, the duo collaborated with vocalists and producers Tiff Lacey, Sue McLaren, Josie, Denise Rivera, Philippe El Sisi, Bjorn Akesson and many more.\nAly & Fila celebrated the 200th episode of their radio show Future Sound Of Egypt 200 by throwing an event in their native home of Egypt on December 2, 2011.

    "text": "Broken Dog is an English, London-based experimental rock band, started in 1994. \nBroken Dog were formed by Martine Roberts and Clive Painter in London in the summer of 1994 and disbanded in 2004 following their fifth album Harmonia. Influenced by American artists such as the Grifters, Swell, Pavement, Smog, Will Oldham and Guided By Voices, their name comes from an unpublished Paul Verlaine libretto. They were signed to Big Cat (UK) Records in 1995 and released their self-titled debut album in 1996 when John Peel began playing their recordings and invited them to record the first of four Peel sessions.\nBoth Martine Roberts and Clive Painter have been known for collaborating with other bands such as Tram, Monograph and The Real Tuesday Weld.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMartine Roberts (1994–2004)\nClive Painter (1994–2004)\nGuest musicians\nRob Crutchley (1995) - Monograph (band)\nPaul Anderson (1997–1999) - Tram (band)\nNick Avery (1997–1999) - Tram (band)\nJon Hamilton (1999–2000) - Ligament, Part Chimp\nAndrew Blick (2000–2002) - Blowpipe\nSean Newsham (2000–2002) - Quickspace\nAlex Morris (2000–2002) - Candidate\nMark Wilsher (1999–2002) - Faith Over Reason\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\nBroken Dog (Big Cat Records), (1996)\nZero (Big Cat Records), (1998)\nSleeve with Hearts (Piao!), (1999)\nBrighter Now (Kitty Kitty), (2001)\nHarmonia (Tongue Master Records), (2004)\n Flips (Selected B-sides + Rarities)  (Tongue Master Records), (2017)\nSingles & EPs\n\"Throw Everything Away\" (Big Cat Records), (1996)\n\"Trails\" (Big Cat Records), (1997)\n\"Safety in Numbers\" (Big Cat Records), (1998)\n\"They Were Real\" (Piao!), (1999)\n\"Anchor\" (Kitty Kitty), (2001)\n\"Radios\" (Tongue Master Records), (2002)\nCompilations\nPast, Present, Future (Big Cat Records), (1997)\nSongs for the Blue Times (Autoreverse), (2000)\nThe Pot Machine Turns You On (Ptolemaic Terrascope), (2000)\nA Wish on a Star (Dreamy Records), (2001)\nHomesleep Home, Cover Songs (Homesleep), (2001)\n\n\n== References =="

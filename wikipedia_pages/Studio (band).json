    "text": "Studio was a Swedish musical duo consisting of Dan Lissvik and Rasmus Hägg, founded by Lissvik (Atelje) in 2000 at Valand School of Fine Arts . Studio have been described as the missing link between The Cure and Lindstrøm – while simultaneously touching upon Can, Neu, Happy Mondays and The Smiths –  in their creation of an \"afrobeat-dub-disco-indie-pop\" adventure. Their album West Coast was chosen by Rough Trade in London as one of the 10 best albums of 2007 and they have remixed artists such as Kylie Minogue and A Mountain of One.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== CD/download ===\nWest Coast (2007)\nYearbook 1 (2007)\nYearbook 2 (2008)\n\n\n=== LP, 12\" and 7\" ===\nWest Side Parts 1 and 2 (2007) (7\", limited edition of 1,000 copies)\nWest Coast (album)|West Coast (Second Edition, double LP)\nLife's a Beach!

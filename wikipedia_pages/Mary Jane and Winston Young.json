They were part of the movement that tied folk music to a socially progressive view of the world.\nThe Youngs performed various kinds of folk based music, including Irish tunes and political tunes and American tunes and songs from Ewen McColl.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn November 1960 the Youngs' music was featured on the BBC program Roundabout.\nThe pair were regular performers at Toronto's folk club and cultural centre, the Bohemian Embassy Coffee House which was run by actor/cultural animator Don Cullen. The Youngs didn't record anything but a few live recordings. They appeared alongside many Canadian acts, Gordon Lightfoot, Ian and Sylvia, Joni Mitchell and Stan Rogers. They were to a significant part of the Toronto folk scene in the late fifties and early sixties.\nThe Youngs performed at the first Mariposa Folk Festival.  In 2001 they performed as part of a Bohemian Embassy reunion night fundraiser for the Humanist Association of Toronto.\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Zozobra was an American sludge metal band that was first conceived by Caleb Scofield during 2006. He was joined by Santos Montano for the band's first release, Harmonic Tremors, in 2007. Early Zozobra recordings had a lot in common with the experimental-hardcore of Old Man Gloom and symbolically shares a synonymous name. Zozobra toured the United States with Isis and Jesu in early 2007.\nZozobra allowed Caleb Scofield the chance to write his own songs for the first time ever, unlike Cave In and Old Man Gloom.\nTheir second album, Bird of Prey, was released on August 5, 2008, and featured Aaron Harris of Isis on drums. Their third full-length, Savage Masters, was released on April 2, 2013.\nScofield died on March 28, 2018, but contributors to the band's recordings have played multiple live sets of Zozobra songs as a tribute to Scofield.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\nAdam McGrath (Cave In, Clouds, Bodega Girls) – guitar, vocals (2007, 2012–present)\nJR Conners (Cave In) – drums (2012–present)\nPast member\nCaleb Scofield (Cave In, Old Man Gloom) – vocals, bass, guitar (2006–2018; died 2018)\nSession/touring musicians\nSantos Montano (Old Man Gloom, Forensics) – drums on Harmonic Tremors, live drums (2007–2008)\nAaron Harris (Isis, Palms) – drums on Bird of Prey\nJim Carroll (Clouds, Pure Love, United Nations, The Hope Conspiracy) – live guitar, vocals (2007)\nStephen Brodsky (Cave In) – live bass, vocals (2008)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHarmonic Tremors (Hydra Head Records, 2007)\nBird of Prey (Hydra Head, 2008)\nSavage Masters (Brutal Panda Records, 2013)\n\n\n== References =="

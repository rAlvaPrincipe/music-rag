In 1973, he became principal conductor of the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet, and held the same title after the company moved to Birmingham to become the Birmingham Royal Ballet (BRB).  He served as music director of the Royal Ballet from 1990 to 1995, and again from 2006 to 2015.  He returned to BRB as its music director from 2005 to 2008.  Wordsworth is currently principal guest conductor of The Royal Ballet. \nFrom 1989 to 2006, he was principal conductor of the BBC Concert Orchestra, becoming conductor laureate in 2006. From 1989 to 2015, Wordsworth was music director and the Principal Conductor of the Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra. In March 2007 at Brighton, Wordsworth caused controversy when he refused to conduct Andrew Gant's new composition A British Symphony the day of its scheduled premiere.\nWordsworth's discography includes works by lesser-known British composers alongside more mainstream pieces. In his career Wordsworth has appeared with orchestras in the UK and overseas. He has made appearances at the BBC Proms and conducted the Last Night of the Proms in 1993 with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. In 2003, he was the first conductor to record commercially all nine surviving movements of Constant Lambert's ballet Horoscope (only a suite of five movements had previously been recorded).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIMG Artists agency biography of Barry Wordsworth\nHeather Bloom, \"Barry Wordsworth: Best of the Brits\".

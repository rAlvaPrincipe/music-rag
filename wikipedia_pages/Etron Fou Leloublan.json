    "text": "Etron Fou Leloublan (French for \"Crazy Shit, The White Wolf\" or \"Mad Shit, the White Wolf\"), also known as EFL, were a French avant-garde rock band founded in 1973 by actor and saxophonist Chris Chanet. They recorded five studio albums between 1976 and 1985, and released a live album, En Public Aux Etats-Unis d'Amérique recorded during a tour of the United States in 1979. Etron Fou Leloublan were best known as one of the five original Rock in Opposition (RIO) bands that performed at the first RIO festival in London in March 1978.\nEtron Fou Leloublan's music has been described as a blend of punk rock, jazz, French music hall, comedy satire and \"avant-garde mayhem\".\n\n\n== History ==\nEtron Fou Leloublan were originally called Etron Fou, a trio comprising vocalist and saxophonist Eulalie Ruynat (real name Chris Chanet), Ferdinand Richard (bass guitar) and Guigou Chenevier (drums, percussion). Their first concert was on 27 December 1973, when they opened for the French progressive rock band, Magma. Etron Fou then went on to produce a \"viable, musical alternative to both French rock'n'roll and French free jazz\", which had stagnated at the time. In November 1976, they changed their name to Etron Fou Leloublan and recorded their first album, Batelages (1977). Chanet left the band before the album was released.\nTowards the end of 1977 Francis Grand replaced Chanet on saxophone and the trio recorded their second album, Les Trois Fous Perdégagnent (Au Pays Des...). In March 1978, at the invitation of English avant-garde rock group Henry Cow, Etron Fou Leloublan joined Rock in Opposition (RIO) and performed at the first RIO festival in London with four other groups. They also played at the second RIO festival in Milan in April 1979, organised by RIO's Italian representative, Stormy Six. In November 1979, Etron Fou Leloublan toured the United States, and performances at the Squat Club in New York City and Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut were recorded and released on a live album, En Public aux Etats-Unis d'Amérique.\nEtron Fou Leloublan became a quartet in 1980 with Bernard Mathieu replacing Grand on saxophone, and the addition of multi-instrumentalist and singer Jo Thirion. In mid-1980, the band recorded with former Henry Cow guitarist Fred Frith in France and Switzerland, and appeared on one side of Frith's 1981 solo LP, Speechless. Frith produced Etron Fou Leloublan's next album, Les Poumons Gonflés (1982), on which he also guested on two of the tracks, playing violin and guitar. For their fifth album, Les Sillons de la Terre (1984) the saxophonist changed again with Bruno Meillier replacing Mathieu.\nEtron Fou Leloublan recorded their last album, Face Aux Éléments Déchaînés in August 1985 as a trio of Richard, Thirion, and Chenevier, not bothering to fill the recurring vacant saxophone position. Frith produced the album and guested on four of the tracks. The band broke up in 1986.\n\n\n== Members ==\nFerdinand Richard – bass guitar, vocals\nGuigou Chenevier – drums, percussion\nChris Chanet (Eulalie Ruynat) (1973–1976) – vocals, saxophone\nFrancis Grand (1976–1978) – saxophone\nGérard Bole Du Chaumont (1978) – saxophone\nBernard Mathieu (1979–1982) – saxophone\nJo Thirion (1980–1986) – organ, piano, trumpet\nBruno Meillier (1982–1983) – saxophone\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBatelages (1977, LP, Gratte-Ciel)\nLes Trois Fous Perdégagnent (Au Pays Des...)

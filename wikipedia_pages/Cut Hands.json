    "text": "Cut Hands is a British electronic music project of William Bennett, formerly of the power electronics band Whitehouse. Cut Hands began in 2008, and its music is heavily inspired by African and Haitian Vodou music, characterized by its rhythmic and percussion-based style.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nThe project began when William Bennett was invited to DJ at Optimo, a large club in Glasgow. When he asked what they wanted him to play, they told him he could play whatever he wanted. At the time, he was very interested in the music of African culture, and thus he played ritual drumming music, mixed in with Haitian Vodou music. The name \"Cut Hands\" is a reference to the Whitehouse song \"Cut Hands Has the Solution\", which was from their 2003 album Bird Seed.\nBennett's work as Cut Hands has brought him considerable attention in mainstream media, being placed in documentaries such as VICE's Kings of Cannabis and having songs like \"Black Mamba\" sampled in hip-hop such as Danny Brown's \"Pneumonia\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nAfro Noise I (Volume 1) (2011, Very Friendly)\nAfro Noise I (Volume 2) (2011, Very Friendly)\nBlack Mamba (2012, Very Friendly)\nFestival Of The Dead (2014, Blackest Ever Black)\nAfro Noise I (Volume 3) (2014, Dirter Promotions)\nAfro Noise I (Volume 4) (2014, Dirter Promotions)\nSixteen Ways Out (2022, Susan Lawly)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nAfro Noise I (2011, Artencio/Susan Lawly)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Black Mamba\" 12\" (2012, Blackest Ever Black)\n\"Damballah\" 12\" (2013, Blackest Ever Black)\n\"Madwomen\" 12\" (2013, Downwards)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCut Hands Facebook page\nCut Hands Discogs page"

    "text": "Finger 5 (フィンガー5, Fingā Faibu) was a Japanese pop group, initially composed of the four Okinawan Tamamoto brothers Kazuo, Mitsuo, Masao, Akira, and sister Taeko. Their greatest hit was \"Koi no Dial 6700\" (恋のダイヤル6700, \"Love Dial 6700\").\nThe Okinawa-based group performed catchy songs, wore matching outfits and had choreographed dance routines. They even performed cover versions of Motown hits, including those of the Jackson 5. The band was formed in 1967 with only the three brothers Kazuo, Mitsuo and Masao, who performed as All Brothers. Conveniently their father owned a bar in Okinawa at which they performed. After winning a local talent contest it was decided that they could go farther if based in Tokyo, although at the time the eldest brother Kazuo was still only 14. The group, who were partly inspired by the Partridge Family TV show, struggled in the Tokyo area, often playing at venues that catered to US military, as they had done in Okinawa.\nIn 1970, they signed with King Records as the Baby Brothers, but their three releases did not sell well. In early 1972 Akira and Taeko were added to the group and they became Finger Five. Later that year they debuted on the Philips label, with First Album, and scored a huge hit with the single “Kojin Jugyo (Private Lessons)\" in 1973. “Kojin Jugyo” sold almost a million and a half copies, and follow-up singles \"Koi no Dial 6700 (Love Call 6700)\" and “Gakuen Tengoku” were also major hits.\nTheir songs were primarily about school life and puppy love, and most of their fans were youngsters. After working hard for years, the group had attained superstar status. They became regulars on the weekly TV show Ginza NOW, and made the movies Hello Finger Five, Chonoryoku Dayo! Zenin Shugo and Finger Five No Dai Boken, all of which were released in 1974. That year they also held a joint concert with Canada’s De Franco Family. The group, however, were not able to hold on to their popstar crown very long. In 1975, Kazuo dropped out of the group, and his cousin Minoru Gushiken replaced him. The group was feeling overwhelmed by the sudden stardom thrust on them, and after a good-bye tour, relocated to the United States for late 1975 and early 1976. Besides catching their breath, the members wanted to approach their craft more seriously and evolve beyond being “idols”. However, in their absence, interest in the group waned, and when they returned to release their more mature music, sales evaporated.\nIn 1978, Finger 5 disbanded, although some members have attempted comebacks, in 1980 as Fingers, 1985 as Zapp, in 1991 as Finger Five, in 1992 as Finger Five Soul Band, and in 1994 as AM Fingers.\n\n\n== Former members ==\nKazuo Tamamoto (玉元 一夫, Tamamoto Kazuo) (born April 8, 1955) - lead guitar, backing vocals (1972–1975)\nMitsuo Tamamoto (玉元 光男, Tamamoto Mitsuo) (born February 3, 1957) - drums, backing vocals (1972–1978)\nMasao Tamamoto (玉元 正男, Tamamoto Masao) (born February 2, 1959) - bass, backing vocals (1972–1978)\nAkira Tamamoto (玉元 晃, Tamamoto Akira) (born May 9, 1961) - lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1972–1978)\nTaeko Tamamoto (玉元 妙子, Tamamoto Taeko) (born June 7, 1962) - keyboards, backing vocals (1972–1978)\nMinoru Gushiken (具志堅 実, Gushiken Minoru) (born January 23, 1967) - lead guitar, backing vocals (1975–1978)\nHiroshi Yasu (安 広司, Yasu Hiroshi) (born April 29, 1960) (1978)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nBaby Brothers\n\"Watashi no Koibito-san\" (私の恋人さん, \"My Lover\") (June 20, 1970)\n\"Jingle Bells\" (ジングルベル, Jinguru Beru) (October 20, 1970)\n\"Shiroi Tenshi\" (白い天使, \"White Angel\") (November 20, 1970)\nFinger 5\n\"Kiddy Kiddy Love\" (キディ・キディ・ラブ, Kidi Kidi Rabu) (August 25, 1972)\n\"Kojin Jugyō\" (個人授業, \"Individual Lessons\") (August 25, 1973)\n\"Christmas Party with Finger 5\" (フィンガー5とクリスマス・パーティー, Fingā Faibu to Kurisumasu Pātī) (December 1, 1973)\n\"Koi no Dial 6700\" (恋のダイヤル6700（シックスセブンオーオー）, Koi no Dairaru Shikkusu Sebun Ō Ō, \"Love Dial 6700\") (December 5, 1973)\n\"Gakuen Tengoku\" (学園天国, \"School Heaven\") (March 5, 1974)\n\"Koi no American Football\" (恋のアメリカン・フットボール, Koi no Amerikan Futtobōru, \"American Football Love\") (June 25, 1974)\n\"Koi no Daiyogen\" (恋の大予言, \"The Great Prophecy of Love\") (September 10, 1974)\n\"Christmas Party with Finger 5\" (フィンガー5とクリスマス・パーティー, Fingā Faibu to Kurisumasu Pātī) (November 10, 1974)\n\"Kareina Uwasa\" (華麗なうわさ, \"Brilliant Rumors\") (December 25, 1974)\n\"Meiken Lassie\" (名犬ラッシー, Meiken Rasshī, \"Famous Dog Lassie\") (February 5, 1975)\n\"Bump Tengoku\" (バンプ天国, Banpu Tengoku, \"Bump Heaven\") (March 5, 1975)\n\"Bokura no Papa wa Karate no Sensei\" (ぼくらのパパは空手の先生, \"Our Dad Is a Karate Teacher\") (June 21, 1975)\n\"Kaette Kuru yo\" (帰ってくるよ, \"I'll Be Back\") (November 21, 1975)\n\"Jet Machine\" (ジェット・マシーン, Jetto Mashīn) (February 21, 1976)\n\"Tobe!

    "text": "Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings are an English blues rock band founded and led by bassist Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones. Other personnel have varied depending on availability, an arrangement described in The Telegraph as \"a fluctuating squad of veterans\". Their concerts and albums tend to emphasize cover songs of blues, R&B and early rock and roll hits from the 1950s.\n\n\n== History ==\nWyman formed the Rhythm Kings after leaving the Rolling Stones in 1993 following their worldwide tour in support of Steel Wheels and a short hiatus from the music industry, citing a desire to work in smaller clubs and avoid the pressure of being in one of the most successful rock bands in the world. \nOn 10 December 2007, Wyman and his band appeared alongside a reunited Led Zeppelin at the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 in London.\nIn 2009, ex-Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor was invited as a guest performer with Wyman's Rhythm Kings.\nThe band have not performed live since 2014, and last released a studio album - Studio Time - in 2018.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nStruttin' Our Stuff (October 1997)\nAnyway the Wind Blows (February 1999)\nGroovin' (May 2000)\nDouble Bill (May 2001)\nJust for a Thrill (May 2004)\nStudio Time (2018)\nLive albums\n\nRhythm Kings Live (November 2005)\nLive Communication (September 2011)\nCompilation albums\n\nStudio Time (April 2018)\nSingles\n\n\"Groovin'\" / \"Can't Get My Rest at Night\" / \"Gambler's Lament\" (2000)\n\"That's How Heartaches Are Made\" / \"I Know (You Don't Love Me No More)\" (2004)\nVideo albums\n\nBill Wyman's Rhythm Kings in Concert (2002)\nBill Wyman's Rhythm Kings - Let the Good Times Roll (2004)\n\n\n== Featured musicians ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nRingo Starr & His All Starr Band\nWorld Classic Rockers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBill Wyman's Rhythm Kings Official Site"

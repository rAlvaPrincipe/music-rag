The song achieved relative success in the carts in Israel and Spain.\nDuring 1995 and 1996 the group released four more singles that were very successful in the Israeli charts as well – the song \"Lover\" (performed in collaboration with Dikla Shachar), \"Will You (Still Love Me), \"Let's Go\", and \"One Last Thing\". This local success attracted interest in the group worldwide, as some of the group's songs of began appearing in compilation albums of contemporary hits.\nDuring the second half of the 1990s Insideout's career faded mainly due to Levin's recruitment to the army.\nIn 1997, the group released their last single to the markets which was a cover version to Sash!'s hit \"Ecuador\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1994 – \"Dance\" (featuring Didi)\n1995 – \"Lover\"\n1995 – \"Will You (Still Love Me)\"\n1996 – \"Let's Go\"\n1996 – \"One Last Thing\"\n1997 – \"Sing The Ecuador\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography from The Eurodance Encyclopædia\nInsideout on Discogs"

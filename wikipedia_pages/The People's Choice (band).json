    "text": "The People's Choice was an American funk band formed in 1971 in Philadelphia by Frank Brunson and David Thompson. While they had several vocalists, their biggest hits were instrumentals.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTheir debut single, \"I Likes To Do It\" on Phil-L.A. of Soul Records, got to #9 on the U.S. Billboard R&B chart and #38 on the Billboard Hot 100. A short time later Leon Huff saw People's Choice in concert, and told Brunson that he wished the group had recorded \"I Likes To Do It\" for Philadelphia International Records. Huff (without Kenny Gamble on this occasion) signed the group in 1974, and it was with him that they had another hit single with \"Do It Any Way You Wanna\", a Philly dance classic. It sold over one million copies in three months, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in November 1975. This song was used in Fred Williamson's 1976 film Death Journey.\nBrunson died on November 24, 2007, after a long illness.\n\n\n== Former members ==\nFrank Brunson - keyboards, vocals (died on November 24, 2007, at age 78).\nDavid Thomson - drums\nGuy Fiske - guitar\nRoger Andrews - bass\nMarc Reed - vocals \nClifton Gamble - piano, synthesizer\nJohnnie Hightower - guitar\nBill Rodgers - piano, synthesizer\nDarnell Jordan - guitar\nStanley Thomas - bass, vocals\nValerie Brown - vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nGolden Classics (1996, Collectables)\nI Likes to Do It (2000, Jamie)\nAny Way You Wanna - The People's Choice Anthology 1971-1981 (2017, BBR)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe People's Choice at AllMusic\nThe People's Choice discography at Discogs\nsoulfulkindamusic.net - Frankie Brunson / The Fashions\nFrankie Brunson Biography"

    "text": "L'Trimm was a Miami bass hip-hop duo composed of  Bunny D and Lady Tigra. Originally from Coconut Grove, Florida (origin neighborhood of the City of Miami), they recorded three albums for Atlantic Records: Grab It! in 1988 (which is certified Gold by the RIAA), Drop That Bottom in 1989 (which led The Source to name the group Hip-Hop Goddesses of the Month), and Groovy in 1991.\n\n\n== Group history ==\nThe group took its new name from a then-popular designer brand of blue jeans (Trim) and added the L' prefix to give it a French feel. The song \"Grab It!\" became a local hit and was followed by an album of the same name. Shortly after, \"Cars with the Boom\", an ode to subwoofers, reached No. 54 on the Billboard Hot 100, and a national tour followed. Atlantic Records picked up the group's first album, and signed a deal to distribute L'Trimm's second album, Drop That Bottom, which included a remix of \"Grab It!\" The album was only a minor success. Interest in \"Cars With The Boom\" was later renewed in mid-2020 due to the influence of TikTok.\nL'Trimm became dissatisfied with the direction their music was taking, once co-writers were put in charge of producing their third album Groovy. At the same time, Miami indie labels began to speculate that the Miami bass sound would never break through to mainstream national audiences. As Hot Productions began to look for new creative inspiration, the group hired representation in the form of managers and lawyers. A stalemate was reached and the group abandoned the sessions of its third album, Groovy. With plenty of vocal outtakes left in the studio from previous sessions, Hot Productions continued creating the album without the artists' input. The resulting album had more of a house and new jack swing sound, which sold poorly, failed to find the new market for which it was aiming, and was poorly received by critics. Unwilling to compromise their creative input, unable to score another hit with the label's new sound, and with its youthful pop-rap style waning in popularity, L'Trimm disbanded.\n\n\n== Life after L'Trimm ==\nBunny D became a nurse working in the fields of geriatrics, labor and delivery, and special needs children and adults. She has four children and was married to La Kidd from Philadelphia's Tuff Crew, whom she met while touring together, which released the 1989 hit \"My Parta Town.\" Bunny is also writing a series of children's books and is designing a clothing line.\nAfter a few years of hosting events in Miami's burgeoning music, arts, fashion, and club scenes in South Beach, Lady Tigra moved back to New York City, where she managed nightclubs. In 2008, she moved to Los Angeles and released her first solo project, Please Mr. Boombox (which featured a guest track by MC Lyte), to great critical review, and leading to popular site at the time, MySpace, putting the first track on their sign-in page as video of the month. Tigra wrote and performed the jingle on the Pinkberry website and appeared on the Nickelodeon children's show Yo Gabba Gabba, where she performed Debbie Deb's \"When I Hear Music.\" In 2010, she collaborated with writer/director J.B. Ghuhman Jr. and music producer Yeti Beats on the soundtrack of the award-winning movie Spork, which incorporated many references to 1990s pop-culture.\nIn 2016, Lady Tigra appeared in the American documentary film 808. \nIn 2018 Tigra appeared in the first episode of the second season of the Peabody Award-winning Netflix docuseries \"Hip-Hop Evolution, The Southern Way.\"  Alongside acts such as Uncle Luke, Disco Rick, Trick Daddy, Brother Marquis, Mr. Mixx, The Geto Boys, and UGK.\nIn 2019 Lady Tigra began a collaboration with Spencer Nezey (Her Majesty and the Wolves, Jupiter Rising) called Tigra & Spencer, releasing their first single \"Can't Walk Away\" in December of the same year.\nLady Tigra remains active in New York, Miami, and LA's underground music, fashion, DJ, art and club scenes. \nL'Trimm has not released further material. Although the duo disbanded, they remain close friends, with Lady Tigra often referencing her days in L'Trimm with Bunny D. as one of her influences.\nIn 2019, L'Trimm appeared in the Boogaloo Shrimp documentary, a film about Michael Chambers, the American dancer and actor known as \"Boogaloo Shrimp.\" Michael is most renowned for his role as \"Turbo\" in the 1984 cult movie Breakin’ and its sequel Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.\nIn 2020, L'Trimm's song \"Cars with the Boom\" went viral on the social media app TikTok. On June 3, the compilation album Cars That Go Boom was released.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1988: Grab It!

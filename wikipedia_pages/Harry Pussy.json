    "text": "Harry Pussy was an American noise rock band from Miami, active from 1992 to 1997.  The main members were Bill Orcutt on guitar and vocals and Adris Hoyos on drums and vocals. Other members included Mark Feehan on guitar, later replaced by Dan Hosker. They recorded primarily for the Siltbreeze label.\nThe often-violent music of Harry Pussy is still well-regarded and highly influential in the noise and noise rock scenes. Bill Orcutt's guitar playing was almost exclusively atonal and performed on a four-string guitar. Adris Hoyos' unrestricted, freeform vocalizations and drumming have been noted as an influence by Chris Corsano and by Heather Leigh.\nFollowing the dissolution of Harry Pussy, Hoyos began playing sporadically in improv groups and Orcutt focused on film-making. Bill Orcutt started playing live and releasing albums again in 2009.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nHarry Pussy (1993, Siltbreeze) LP\nRide a Dove (1996, Siltbreeze) LP/CD\nUntitled (1997, no label) LP (nicknamed Fuck You and/or Tour)\nLive at Salon Zwerge (1998, Blackbean & Placenta) one sided LP\nLive Fuck Love Songs (1998, Infinite Egg) LP\nLive (1998, Cherry Smash) 10\" - Note: final show, Churchill's, Miami 5/5/97\nLet's Build a Pussy (1998, Blackbean & Placenta) 2XLP\n\n\n=== Singles and EP's ===\nUntitled (1993, Esync) 7\"\nUntitled (1993, Esync) 7\"\nPlease Don't Come Back from the Moon b/w Nazi USA (1994, Blackjack) 7\"\nUntitled (a.k.a.

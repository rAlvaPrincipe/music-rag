    "text": "Ispíní na hÉireann is an Irish trad and punk band based in Dublin. Guitarist Tomás Mulligan and banjo player Adam J. Holohan decided to form the band after touring in Slovakia in 2017, and they were joined by Aongus Mac Amhlaigh (cello), Pádraig Óg Mac Aodhagháin (uilleann pipes) and Kinko Ceallaigh (bodhrán) the following January. The band's name in Irish means \"Sausages of Ireland\" in English, chosen by Mulligan and Holohan \"because we are the slippiest, greasiest dogs going\". \nEmerging from a neo-traditional movement centred on The Cobblestone pub in Dublin, they have played at festivals including All Together Now, Electric Picnic, and Otherside Festival.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nHot Press magazine characterised the band's relationship with the Irish folk tradition as \"satirical\", and their performances as \"raucous\", \"memorable\", and of \"infectious energy\". \nComparing them to contemporary acts Lankum and Ye Vagabonds, the Headstuff podcast site described the band as \"a less subtle approach that blends heritage and tradition with light-hearted, irreverent comedy\", and said their comedic approach set them apart from similar acts, though their \"musical skill forms a solid skeleton to support the comedy flesh\". \nWriting in The Irish Times newspaper, Una Mullally described their debut album The Hard Working Men (2022) as \"a rambunctious approach that can lean towards laughs before pulling back to demonstrate their musical talents\".\nTheir follow-up EP Worse than Dying was a change of emphasis, described by Riley Glaister-Ryder of Hot Press as \"taking Irish tradition to soaring heights\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Hard Working Men (2022)\nWorse Things Than Dying (2023)\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Mary Wallopers, a contemporary Irish trad/punk act\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

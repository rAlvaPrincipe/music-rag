    "text": "Johnny Hollow is a Canadian electronic music group formed in 2001 in Guelph, Ontario. The band consists of singer Janine White, digital artist Vincent Marcone, cellist Kitty Thompson, and guitarist Steve Hiehn.\nJohnny Hollow is a music collaboration between founding members Janine White & Vincent Marcone. Their brand of avant-garde pop blends organic instruments with electro-industrial sounds. Often featured is contributing member Kitty Thompson. Always accompanied by dark art, they fall into a niche that touches on steampunk and goth genres, while evading specific categorization. Over the years they have acquired an impressive legion of devoted fans who have supported several successful crowd-sourcing campaigns.\nWhite is a classically-trained musician and composer who is also a critically acclaimed sound designer. Marcone (and his alter ego, My Pet Skeleton) is a Juno award-winning graphic artist who combines traditional and digital techniques to craft album covers, fairy tales, short films and music videos.\nJohnny Hollow has produced 3 full-length albums: Johnny Hollow (2003), Dirty Hands (2008), and A Collection of Creatures (2014), and two EPs: Devil's Night (2010) and Old Gods of New Berlin (2018), along with a number of remixes. Their music has been featured on Lost Girl, On a Sunny Afternoon, and The Facts in the Case of Mister Hollow.\n\n\n== Founding of the band ==\nMarcone, formerly known as \"My Pet Skeleton,\" is a graphic designer. He launched his website and asked White to design the sound effects. Meanwhile, White and Thompson were also experimenting in their recording studio. They had sessions as gig musicians, but decided they were not fulfilling enough. My Pet Skeleton quickly rose to the forefront of the web hall of fame. The trio decided to form an alliance. Their first material was presented on the My Pet Skeleton website.\n\n\n== Debut ==\nIn March 2003, Johnny Hollow launched their own small teaser site to announce the release of their first self-produced full-length album. Within one month of the album's release, the band was invited to contribute their first single named 'Bag of Snow' to D-Side's sampler disc, to be in the company of artists like Martin Gore of Depeche Mode, Lisa Gerrard of Dead Can Dance, Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins, Type O Negative, The Cramps and Goldfrapp, who all had a strong influence on the band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio Albums ===\nJohnny Hollow (2003)\nDirty Hands (2008)\nA Collection of Creatures (2014)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nDevils Night (2010)\nOld Gods of New Berlin (2018)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nDevil's Night Remixes (2014)\nThe Mongrel Mixes (2016)\nHer Infinite Jest Alias One Ascendancy Remix (2020)\nMy Lovely Jinn - Alias One Let's burn Together Remix (2020)\nSuperhero - Dead Red Velvet Remix (2020)\nThe Wild Hunt - Isolation Mix (2020)\nThe Wild Hunt - The New Berlin Alias One Remix (2020)\nBogeyman Alias One Remix (2021)\nI, Goblin Jonah K Red Pill Remix (2021)\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nThe Facts in the Case of Mister Hollow (2008, film soundtrack)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohnny Hollow Official site\nJohnny Hollow discography (Bandcamp)\nJohnny Hollow Spotify\nMy Pet Skeleton"

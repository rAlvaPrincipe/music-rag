    "text": "Final Cut is an techno-industrial band formed in Detroit, Michigan and led by Anthony Srock with a revolving cast of guest musicians. \n\n\n== History ==\nSrock, then a DJ in Detroit, formed Final Cut (sometimes preceded by The) in the late 1980s as a collaboration with DJ Jeff Mills. They released their debut single \"Take Me Away\" in 1989 and the album Deep in 2 the Cut later that year. Final Cut was noted for mixing established industrial music with Detroit techno, with a sound comparable to heavy metal but made with machines rather than guitars. Deep in 2 the Cut gained appreciation years later as an influential early entry in the development of industrial music. Mills then left the project, and Srock took a leadership role with various guest musicians and a more guitar-oriented sound.\nThe project was signed to I.R.S. Records and their second album Consumed was released in 1992. That year, Final Cut toured with an all-live band with Srock on lead vocals. After a period of inactivity, Srock returned with another collection of guest musicians in 1996, releasing the album Atonement. This album added 1970s funk to the project's established industrial sound. A remix EP titled Grind was released in 1998. A new album was started in 2004 but never completed. \nSrock later founded Full Effect Records. The 2009 hit single \"Warriors Dance\" by The Prodigy featured a sample of the Final Cut song \"Take Me Away\".\n\n\n== Selected collaborators ==\nTaime Downe\nOgre\nMartin Atkins\nCharles Levi\nChris Connelly\nLouis Svitek\nWilliam Tucker\nDwayne Goettel\nJeff Mills\nGreg Lucas\nMax Edgin\nJoe Lafata\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nDeep into the Cut (1989)\nConsumed (1992)\nAtonement (1996)\nGrind (EP, 1998)\n\n\n== References =="

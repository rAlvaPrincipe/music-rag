    "text": "Blackpink (Korean: 블랙핑크; RR: Beullaekpingkeu, stylized in all caps or as BLɅϽKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment. The group is composed of four members: Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. Regarded by various publications as the \"biggest girl group in the world\", they are recognized as a leading force in the Korean Wave and an ambassador of the \"girl crush\" concept in K-pop, which explores themes of self-confidence and female empowerment.\nBlackpink debuted in August 2016 with their single album Square One, which featured \"Whistle\" and \"Boombayah\", their first number-one entries on South Korea's Circle Digital Chart and the US Billboard World Digital Songs chart, respectively. It was followed by the single album Square Two in November, whose song \"Playing with Fire\" was the first by a Korean girl group to enter the Billboard Canadian Hot 100. The group's domestic and global popularity grew with the chart-topping single \"Ddu-Du Ddu-Du\" (2018), which was the first song by a Korean female group to enter the UK Singles Chart and receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its music video was the first by a Korean group to surpass one and two billion views on YouTube. Their music videos for \"Kill This Love\" (2019) and \"How You Like That\" (2020) each set records for the most-viewed music videos within the first 24 hours of release, with the latter topping the Gaon Digital Chart and breaking five Guinness World Records.\nBlackpink is the highest-charting Korean girl group on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 13 with \"Ice Cream\" (2020), and on the US Billboard 200, peaking at number one with Born Pink (2022). Blackpink's studio albums The Album (2020) and Born Pink each broke the record for the best-selling album by a female act in South Korea, becoming the first to surpass one million and two million copies sold, respectively. Born Pink was the first album by a girl group to reach number one on the Billboard 200 since Danity Kane in 2008, and it set two Guinness World Records as the first album by a Korean girl group to top the Billboard 200 as well as the UK Albums Chart. The album's lead single, \"Pink Venom\" (2022), was the first song by a Korean group to reach number one on Australia's ARIA Singles Chart and the first by a girl group to reach number one on the Billboard Global 200.\nWith 40 billion streams and 20 million records sold worldwide, Blackpink is one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Their Born Pink World Tour (2022–23) became the highest-grossing concert tour by a female group and Asian act, and they were the first Asian act to headline Coachella. They have the most-subscribed and most-viewed music artist channel on YouTube, and are the most-followed and most-streamed girl group on Spotify. Blackpink's accolades include several Golden Disc Awards, MAMA Awards, People's Choice Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards; they became the first girl group to win Group of the Year at the latter awards in the 21st century. Outside of music, they have acquired endorsement deals in various industries and heavily incorporate fashion into their public image. For their work as advocates for climate change awareness, the group was invested as honorary Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 2023. Blackpink was the first girl group to enter Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia and was named Time's 2022 Entertainer of the Year. The group has been ranked among the top of the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 list and recognized by former South Korean President Moon Jae-in for spreading K-pop and Korean culture worldwide.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2010–2016: Formation and pre-debut activities ===\nBlackpink began forming in 2010 when YG Entertainment held tryouts worldwide for preteen or teenage recruits to create a new girl group after launching its first major one, 2NE1, the previous year. According to the members, joining the label as trainees was akin to enrolling in a full-time pop-star academy, with Jennie describing the experience as \"more strict than school\" and Rosé comparing it to The X Factor with dorm rooms. For members who had left their lives outside of South Korea, the pace of training alongside the culture shock was especially difficult. Preparations for Blackpink's debut began as early as 2011, when YG Entertainment revealed on November 14 that their new girl group would debut in the early half of 2012 and feature at least seven members. Consequently, numerous news stories and rumors surfaced surrounding the new girl group's debut being delayed, although there had been no official information. It was until May 18, 2016, that YG Entertainment confirmed the girl group would debut that July, stating that the members were selected through years of stiff competition. The label later confirmed that Jang Hanna and Moon Sua, who was introduced to the public as potential members of the new girl group, were not included in the lineup.\nJennie, the group's main rapper and lead vocalist, was the first member revealed on June 1, 2016. She joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in 2010 after moving back to South Korea from New Zealand. She had been introduced to the public for the first time in 2012 in a photo titled \"Who's that girl?\" on YG Entertainment's website on April 10. Jennie continued to be promoted as a member of the new girl group through multiple collaborations: she starred in the music video for G-Dragon's \"That XX\" (2012) from his EP One of a Kind and featured in the songs \"Black\" (2013), from his album Coup d'Etat, and \"Special\" (2013), from Lee Hi's album First Love. Lisa, the group's main dancer, lead rapper, and sub vocalist, was revealed as the second member on June 8, 2016. She was the only individual among 4,000 applicants to pass the 2010 YG Entertainment audition in her native country, Thailand, and became the label's first foreign trainee in 2011. She was first introduced in May 2012 in a video that was posted on YG Entertainment's YouTube channel, titled \"Who's that girl???\". Lisa also appeared in the music video for Taeyang's \"Ringa Linga\" in 2013. She became a spokesperson for street-wear brand Nona9on in 2015 and cosmetics brand Moonshot in 2016.\nJisoo, the group's visual and a lead vocalist, was revealed as the third member on June 15, 2016. She joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in July 2011 and appeared in several advertisements and music videos in her pre-debut years, including the music videos for Epik High's \"Spoiler + Happy Ending\" (2014) from their album Shoebox and Hi Suhyun's \"I'm Different\" (2014). Jisoo also made a cameo appearance in the 2015 drama The Producers. Rosé, the group's main vocalist and lead dancer, was the final member to be revealed, on June 22, 2016. She ranked first among 700 applicants in the 2012 YG Entertainment audition in Australia, after which she signed a trainee contract with the label and moved to Seoul to begin training. She featured in G-Dragon's track \"Without You\" (2012) from One of a Kind, credited as \"? from YG New Girl Group\" until her official public introduction.\n\nOn June 29, YG Entertainment confirmed that the new girl group would have four members instead of the originally planned seven and revealed its official name as Blackpink. According to a label representative, the group's name meant \"pretty isn't everything\" and symbolized that \"they are a team that encompasses not only beauty, but also great talent\". Jisoo later disclosed in a press conference that other group names under consideration included Pink Punk, Baby Monster, and Magnum. Blackpink released their first dance practice video on July 6, which garnered much public attention. On July 29, YG Entertainment confirmed that Blackpink's debut would be on August 8, 2016.\n\n\n=== 2016–2017: Debut, rising popularity, and commercial success ===\n\nPromotions for the group's debut began in the first week of August 2016 with the release of teaser images, videos, and advertisements.

In South Korea, \"Playing with Fire\" peaked at number three, while \"Stay\" placed in the top ten. Blackpink's commercial success in their first five months earned them several rookie awards at major Korean year-end music award shows, including the Asia Artist Awards, Melon Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, Seoul Music Awards, and Gaon Chart Music Awards. Additionally, Billboard named them one of the best new K-pop groups of 2016.\n\nOn January 17, 2017, Blackpink revealed the name of their fandom—\"Blink\", a portmanteau of \"black\" and \"pink\". On June 22, the group released their first standalone digital single, \"As If It's Your Last\". According to Jisoo, it involved a change of sound from their previous releases, which featured a \"black\" concept, and marked their first single with a brighter \"pink\" concept. The song peaked at number three on the Gaon Digital Chart and at number 13 on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, becoming their first song to enter the latter chart. It debuted at number one on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart one day after release, making it their third number-one single on the chart. The music video for the song later went on to break the record for the most-liked music video by a Korean girl group on YouTube, as well as the most-viewed K-pop group music video in the first 24 hours of release.\nOn July 20, 2017, Blackpink held a showcase at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, which was attended by over 14,000 people, with as many as 200,000 people attempting to purchase tickets.

The EP debuted and peaked atop the Oricon Albums Chart, making Blackpink only the third foreign artist to top the chart with their debut release.

On March 28, Blackpink re-released their debut Japanese EP under the name Re:Blackpink. The digital version included the same songs as the original release, while the physical version included a DVD of all their music videos and six songs in the Korean language.\n\nOn June 15, 2018, the group released their first Korean-language EP, Square Up. In South Korea, the EP debuted at number one on the Gaon Album Chart and was certified platinum by the Korea Music Content Association (KMCA) for selling 250,000 units.

Time characterized their music as a fusion of \"bold rapping, powerful singing and chic styling\"; a signature element in their songs is the frequent use of bass drops, particularly before the chorus, which is considered a defining aspect of their sound by music critics.  The Korea Herald came to associate Blackpink's soundscape with \"grand intros, thumping bass and trap-EDM choruses\".\nThe lyrical themes of the group frequently encompass topics such as independence, female empowerment, the aftermath of breakups, navigating toxic relationships, and the nuances of romance. Jisoo explained in an interview with Rolling Stone that the members are \"involved from the beginning\" in their creative process, from \"building the blocks\" to \"adding this or that feeling\" and \"exchanging feedback\". Regarding their work, Billboard stated that Blackpink \"rewrote the definition of K-pop and their beauty, it's for them not for anyone else.\"\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nEarly in their career, Blackpink stated that they wanted to emulate labelmate 2NE1 and \"show [their] own unique color\". During an episode of Carpool Karaoke in 2023, the members of the group expressed how they were inspired by TLC and the Spice Girls as they grew up listening to their music. Jennie commented that the group admired the vocals, rap, and hip-hop style of TLC, as well as the distinct individual characters of the Spice Girls, saying, \"That was something that we were aiming for and it was such an iconic girl group in history that we grew up listening to.\"\nWhile working with Lady Gaga for \"Sour Candy\" in 2020, the group members expressed that they considered her a major musical influence; Jennie recalled how she admired the creativity and fashion of \"Telephone\" (2010) when she saw the music video for the first time. Other artists that the group has cited as influences include Ariana Grande, Cardi B and Selena Gomez.\n\n\n== Public image ==\n\nBlackpink aimed to represent two contrasting aspects of their musical persona, mirroring their name. The \"black\" facet of the group encapsulates their edgier, \"girl crush\" image, while the \"pink\" facet reflects their more feminine and vibrant image. In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Rosé explained that the group feels that \"there's two colors that represented us the most 'cause we're very girly but at the same time we're very savage too,\" naming their song \"Pretty Savage\" as the song that describes them best because \"it kind of goes with 'black pink.'\" At the press conference commemorating the release of \"Pink Venom\" in August 2022, Jennie elaborated on the group's identity: \"We try to express various messages through songs of various genres but Blackpink is always confident and full of confidence, I thought we were the closest.\"\nStylistically, Blackpink are associated with the \"girl crush\" image in K-pop; Insider wrote that they \"[burst] onto the K-pop scene with a set of singles that set them on a path to becoming the ambassadors of the 'girl crush' concept\", encapsulating \"confidence, sexiness, and inspirational assurance, in the K-pop landscape\". Billboard called them \"K-pop's most visible representatives\" of girl crush following the release of \"Ddu-Du Ddu-Du\" (2018). Cultural critic Jung Deok-hyeon analyzed Blackpink for having established a confident image in K-pop and for building a \"solid fandom\" centered on women and female empowerment. News1 commented that the group broke the prevailing notion that only boy groups attract a strong fandom and thereby possess an advantage in the industry.\nBlackpink's influence extends beyond music and into the fashion industry—each member has served as global ambassadors for different luxury brands: Jisoo for Dior, Jennie for Chanel, Rosé for Yves Saint Laurent, and Lisa for Bulgari and Celine. Fashion trade journal WWD remarked that \"What Blackpink has done better than any girl group before it is leverage fashion as a tool to position its members as larger-than-life idols [...] [b]ut in carefully edited videos and behind-the-scenes features released by the group's record label, members exude a giddy kind of youth that still makes them approachable.\" The group has been noted by international media outlets for drawing attention to South Korean hanbok through their modern re-interpretations of the traditional costume in their \"How You Like That\" music video and performances. The group considers fashion to be an important part of their public image, with Jennie telling Elle magazine that it \"definitely empowers us as much as music does\" and Rosé describing it as inseparable from their music. Their style has been noted by South China Morning Post for blending group uniformity with individual tastes.\n\n\n== Legacy and cultural impact ==\n\nSince their debut, Blackpink has emerged as a prominent act in K-pop. They have been referred to as the \"biggest girl group in the world\" by various organizations such as The Recording Academy, Time, and Rolling Stone, \"biggest K-pop girl band on the planet\" by Vogue, NPR, and BBC, and \"K-pop Queens\" by Billboard and The New York Times. The group was hailed as the biggest music act in the world in  Bloomberg's Pop Star Power Ranking of October 2020, and one of the \"world's most influential and bestselling artists\" by Rolling Stone. People included Blackpink in their listing of women changing the contemporary music industry, while Variety named the group one of the most impactful figures in global entertainment. Various artists have cited Blackpink as a direct influence, including Babymonster, Izna, H1-Key, Tri.be, Kiss of Life, Classy, Primrose, Le Sserafim's Kazuha, Lapillus' Shana and Haeun, Fifty Fifty's Saena, Mimiirose's Seo Yun-ju, and @onefive.\n\nIn South Korea, they ranked first on the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 list in 2019, third in 2020, second in 2021 and 2022,  third in 2023, and first in 2024. They were the first girl group to make Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia and were named on the 2019 Time 100 Next list of rising stars, credited with \"heralding a new era of Korean acts stepping past language barriers to play global stages\" when they became the first K-pop group to perform at Coachella, the world's largest music festival.  Bloomberg wrote that, alongside BTS, \"Blackpink has achieved a level of global popularity unprecedented in the history of music\", while South China Morning Post highlighted Blackpink, BTS and K-dramas as leaders in the global interest of Korean pop culture. The New York Times recognized Blackpink as one of South Korea's major cultural exports alongside companies such as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai, with entities like Blackpink, Squid Game, and Parasite appearing \"as ubiquitous as any Samsung phone\".\nPop culture critic Kim Do-heon credited Blackpink for changing the perceptions of K-pop artists in the global music scene, garnering attention as iconic figures \"on the same footing as Western pop stars\" rather than challengers competing with them. He further added that they succeeded in becoming a group with \"enormous influence worldwide\" despite having less releases than other K-pop groups, and successfully transcended beyond just a music group to their own brand. In 2020, CJ E&M honored the group as one of the ten \"2020 Visionary\" figures for their contributions in spreading Korean pop culture globally. During South Korean President Moon Jae-in's 2021 New Year's address, Blackpink was cited as a leader in the promotion of South Korea's image abroad and highlighted government support of such entities as a key strategy in \"firmly [solidifying] Korea's status as a cultural powerhouse\".\nSisa Journal identified Blackpink's global influence as a standout even among the other greatest girl groups in K-pop history, such as Girls' Generation, 2NE1, Wonder Girls, and Twice, and expressed that just as the symbol of girl groups for pop music fans around the world was the Spice Girls in the mid-1990s, \"the representative image of today's girl group is none other than Blackpink.\" While discussing the evolution of girl groups since the early 20th century, The Recording Academy noted how \"the success of K-pop girl groups shot to a new level when Blackpink entered the scene in 2016\". Billboard credited Blackpink for helping \"dismantle the lingering walls between 'K-pop' and the American mainstream\" and named them \"the most successful K-pop girl group to have impacted the U.S. market\", citing the group's performances at Coachella as well as their Billboard 200 chart-topping album Born Pink. The Circle Chart observed a significant increase in the incorporation of English lyrics in songs by South Korean girl groups after Blackpink's international breakthrough in 2020; the organization saw it as an attempt for girl groups to broaden their listener base to include audiences outside of Korea.\nBlackpink have amassed a large following on social media and streaming platforms; they became the most-subscribed music group on YouTube in September 2019, the most-subscribed female artist in July 2020, and the most-subscribed music act overall in September 2021, with over 90 million subscribers as of July 2023. Blackpink became the most-followed girl group on Spotify in November 2019; as of April 2023, they have over 40 million followers. On Instagram, the group's members are the four most-followed individuals based in South Korea (in order from first to fourth: Lisa, Jennie, Jisoo and Rosé).\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Endorsements ===\nBlackpink has acquired numerous endorsement deals in various industries throughout their career. Globally, the group members were ambassadors for Kia Motors, which also served as the title sponsor for the group's In Your Area World Tour. In North America, Blackpink partnered with toy company Jazwares to create a collection of dolls styled in outfits from their music videos, as well as other collectible toy lines. In June 2020, they collaborated with Zepeto, a South Korean 3D avatar service operated by Naver Z, to offer fans characters that correspond to each member that allow fans to see the characters sing and dance, as well as take pictures together on the app. Blackpink's virtual fan-sign event on the app was popular among international fans, with the service surpassing 30 million participants as of September 11, 2020, and the number of new users increasing by 300,000 following the release of the \"Ice Cream\" dance performance video. The group also teamed up with the popular battle royale game PUBG Mobile to release collaborative content and events within the game.\nIn Asia, Blackpink endorsed Samsung, working with the company on multiple campaigns to promote its electronics products, such as the #danceAwesome challenge to promote Galaxy A. In August 2019, Samsung launched a Blackpink Special Edition set in Southeast Asia, comprising its Galaxy A80, Galaxy Watch Active, and Galaxy Buds. The group featured Galaxy S10+ smartphones and Galaxy Buds earbuds in their \"Kill This Love\" music video.

Blackpink also released merchandise in collaboration with Tokyo Girls Collection x Cecil McBee in Japan. In July 2018 and August 2020, the group ranked first among all artists in brand reputation based on analyses by The Korea Reputation Research Institute, making them the only female act to do so.\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nIn December 2018, Blackpink donated their prize money from the Elle Style Awards 2018, worth ₩20 million (around US$16,630), to low-income and single-parent households in South Korea. In April 2019, Blackpink made a donation of ₩40 million (around US$33,300) to the Hope Bridge Association of the National Disaster Relief for the victims of the Goseong wildfire in South Korea, doing the same in March 2022 by donating ₩500 million to pay for damage repair caused by the wildfires happening in Gangwon and North Gyeongsang Province. In April 2020, Blackpink released face masks via UMG-affiliated merchandising company Bravado. All proceeds benefited Recording Academy's MusiCares initiative, which launched a relief fund in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the music industry.\nIn December 2020, the group called for action on climate change and promoted the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), hoping their fans would \"join us on this journey\" to \"learn about what's happening, what needs to happen and how we can play our part.\" On February 25, 2021, Blackpink was formally appointed official advocates for COP26 in Seoul, where they received a personal appreciation letter written by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, for their work in the spread of climate change awareness. On October 23, 2021, the group was a part of the lineup for the YouTube Originals special entitled \"Dear Earth\", which focused on encouraging viewers to become more environmentally conscious. In his speech for a state banquet hosting South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Buckingham Palace, British monarch King Charles III offered praise to Blackpink's work as ambassadors to environmental sustainability causes.\n\n\n== Accolades and achievements ==\n\nBlackpink's accolades include fourteen Circle Chart Music Awards, seven Golden Disc Awards, eleven MAMA Awards, five Melon Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, three People's Choice Awards, four Seoul Music Awards, a Billboard Music Award, a MTV Europe Music Award, and a Teen Choice Award.

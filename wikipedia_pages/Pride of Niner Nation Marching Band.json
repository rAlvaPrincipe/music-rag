    "text": "The University of North Carolina at Charlotte Pride of Niner Nation Marching Band, also known as The Pride of Niner Nation, and PNNMB is the official marching band for the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. They perform at every Charlotte 49ers home football game at Jerry Richardson Stadium and also at various other events such as away football games, pep rallies, parades, and special observances. A partial band usually travels to at least one away game a year. The band includes a color guard and a baton twirler. Members of the PNNMB also participate in Wind Ensemble, Symphonic Band, Jazz Ensemble, and the 49ers Basketball Band.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first marching band at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte was founded in 2015. With the restart of UNC Charlotte's football program in 2013, the university had no immediate plans to start a marching band. Alumnus and former UNC Charlotte Board of Trustees chairman Gene Johnson and his wife Vickie, also an alum, helped to organize several donations for the purchase of equipment and staff for a twenty-five-person drumline, with corresponding scholarships for the drummers. The drumline debuted with the team in 2013. The positive response to these efforts encouraged the university to develop a plan to debut a full marching band for the 2015 season. This included raising $2,000,000 for construction of a permanent home for the band and $4,500,000 to endow scholarships for band members.\nIn fall 2014 Jeff Miller was hired as the first Director of Athletic Bands and, under UNC Charlotte Director of Bands Shawn Smith, began recruiting the inaugural band class. With an additional gift of $2,000,000 from the Johnsons ground was broken on the Vickie and Gene Johnson Marching Band Center. The members of the drumline and the pre-existing Basketball Pep Band, who would soon merge into the larger marching band, chose the name Pride of Niner Nation Marching Band for the new entity.\nThe Pride of Niner Nation Marching Band debuted in the 2015 football season alongside the 49ers' move up to FBS level and the inaugural season of C-USA play.\n\n\n=== Director of Athletic Bands ===\nJeff Miller  (2014–2018)\nJoseph Schievert (2018–2019)\nShayna Stahl  (2019–2021)\nDaniel Fischer (2021–2022)\nBrian Taylor (2023–current)\n\n\n=== 2018 D-Day anniversary ===\nThe Pride of Niner Nation Marching Band was invited and accepted to perform in Normandy for the 2018 D-Day anniversary observance.

The band was formed in 2005 by Lindz West, a member of dance band The Tribe, who had split up the previous year. LZ7 worked for many years as a part of the Christian charity The Message Trust, working with tens of thousands of teenagers each year in schools across Greater Manchester, Maidenhead and Reading. In 2012 LZ7 moved on from being part of the Message Trust and moved under the banner of independent charitable organisation \"Light\". The group is fronted by West who is the band's lead singer and rapper. In recent years LZ7 have moved into more mainstream areas, collaborating with artists such as Silentó and supporting Jason Derulo on his '2 Sides World Tour'.\n\n\n== History ==\nLindz West, LZ7's frontman, had been a member of Manchester-based dance band The Tribe for three years from 2001. The Tribe's main focus was working with young people in high schools across Greater Manchester as part of youth charity The Message Trust, but they had also received acclaim as recording artists, winning three GMA Dove Awards.\nAfter The Tribe disbanded in 2004, West originally intended to work with thebandwithnoname, but instead chose to create his own band, and formed LZ7 the following year, also under the banner of The Message Trust. LZ7 performed in school assemblies during 2005, and, alongside this work, played outdoor events over the summer, including Live Audacious, Grapevine and Merseyfest. Their debut album, Ruckus, was launched on 11 December 2005, before being officially released through Survivor Records on New Year's Eve.\n\nIn 2006, LZ7 contributed to two Christian youth resources with members of BlushUK and Andy Hawthorne, founder of The Message Trust. These were a DVD named Deep and an album called Start Something. Deep won a Gold Award at the Christian Broadcast Council Annual Media Awards in 2006 for Best Factual DVD.

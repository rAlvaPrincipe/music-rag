    "text": "Gustaf Allan Pettersson (19 September 1911 – 20 June 1980) was a Swedish composer and violist. He is considered one of the 20th century's most important Swedish composers and was described as one of the last great symphonists, often compared to Gustav Mahler.: 3  His music can hardly be confused with other 20th-century works. In the final decade of his life, his symphonies (typically one-movement works) developed an international following, particularly in Germany and Sweden. Of these, his best known work is Symphony No. 7. His music later found success in the United States.: 7  The conductors Antal Doráti and Sergiu Comissiona premiered and recorded several of his symphonies. Pettersson's song cycle Barefoot Songs influenced many of his compositions. Doráti arranged eight of the Barefoot Songs. Birgit Cullberg produced three ballets based on Pettersson's music.\nPettersson studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Music's conservatory. For more than a decade, he was a violist in the Stockholm Concert Society; after retiring he devoted himself exclusively to composition. Later in his life, he experienced rheumatoid arthritis. Pettersson was awarded the Swedish royal medal Litteris et Artibus.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nBorn on 19 September 1911, Gustaf Allan Pettersson was the youngest of four children. His father, Karl Viktor Pettersson (1875–1952), was a violent, alcoholic blacksmith, and his mother, Ida Paulina (née Svenson) (1876–1960), was a dressmaker. Pettersson was born at Granhammar manor in Västra Ryd parish in the Uppland province of Sweden. He grew up poor in Stockholm's Södermalm district, where he lived during his whole life. He once said: I wasn't born under a piano, I didn't spend my childhood with my father, the composer... no, I learnt how to work white-hot iron with the smith's hammer. My father was a smith who may have said no to God, but not to alcohol. My mother was a pious woman who sang and played with her four children.\nWith his parents and siblings, Pettersson lived in a damp, one-room basement apartment with bars on the window. When he was 10, Pettersson bought a cheap violin with money he earned from selling Christmas cards and taught himself to play it. Even the beatings he received from his father and the threat of reform school could not diminish his interest in music. Through strict self-discipline and with the help of music, Pettersson freed himself from his social misery and difficult family circumstances. Aged 14, he finished elementary school and took up full-time practice on the violin. He later made two unsuccessful attempts to enter the Royal Swedish Academy of Music's conservatory.\nIn 1930, he began studying violin and later the viola, as well as counterpoint and harmony, at the Royal Swedish Academy of Music's conservatory (Royal College of Music, Stockholm). At the beginning of World War II, he was in Paris, studying the viola with the French violist Maurice Vieux. Pettersson won the Jenny Lind scholarship prize in 1938, using it to study abroad.\n\n\n=== Later life ===\n\nDuring the 1940s he worked as a violist in the Stockholm Concert Society (later the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra). He also studied composition with the composer and conductor Karl-Birger Blomdahl, orchestration with the conductor Tor Mann, and counterpoint with organist and composer Otto Olsson. In 1943, he married a physiotherapist, Gudrun Tyra Charlotta Gustafsson (1921–2017).\nIn September 1951, he went to Paris to study composition and was a student of composers René Leibowitz, Arthur Honegger, Olivier Messiaen, and Darius Milhaud. Pettersson returned to Sweden at the end of 1952. In the early 1950s, he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. He gave up playing the viola and began devoting his life to composition. In 1954, Pettersson received an annual state composition grant for his first time.\nBy the time of his Symphony No. 5, completed in 1962, his mobility and health were compromised considerably. In 1964, the government granted him a lifelong guaranteed income. His greatest success came a few years later with his Symphony No. 7 (1966), which premiered on 13 October 1968 in Stockholm Concert Hall with Antal Doráti conducting the Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. A recording of his seventh symphony, with the same conductor and orchestra, was released in 1969. It was a breakthrough, establishing his international reputation, and he received two Swedish Grammis in 1970.: 7  The conductors Antal Doráti and Sergiu Comissiona premiered and made first recordings of several of Pettersson's symphonies and contributed to his rise to fame during the 1970s.\nPettersson was hospitalized for nine months in 1970, soon after the composition of his Symphony No. 9, his longest symphony. He began writing the condensed Symphony No. 10 (1972) from his sickbed. Pettersson was admitted to Karolinska Hospital, because of a life-threatening kidney ailment. He recovered, but rheumatoid arthritis confined him most of the time to his fourth-floor apartment in a building with no elevator. In 1975, after a dispute about a change in a concert program for an American tour, the Stockholm Philharmonic was forbidden to perform works by Pettersson \"for all time\". The ban was lifted in 1976. Pettersson was awarded the Litteris et Artibus, a Swedish royal medal established in 1853, in 1977. In autumn 1978, he moved to a state living quarters. He began writing his seventeenth symphony, but died, at age 68, in Stockholm's Maria Magdalena parish before finishing it. He is buried in the Högalid Church columbarium.\n\n\n== Music ==\nPettersson's music can be compared to Mahler's symphonic output, especially in the magnificent design and the passion and dynamism. The symphonic eccentric Pettersson is not an avant-gardist. His kinetic and organic development of musical matter uses traditional means of expression. Basic motifs are constantly being changed and developed. Pettersson's writing is very strenuous and often has many simultaneous polyphonic lines. His symphonies end on common major or minor chords: 5 —but tonality, which depends on some sense, however attenuated, of tonal progression, is found mostly in slower sections. This can be shown at the openings and endings of his 6th and 7th symphonies, and the end of his 9th. Overwhelmingly serious in tone, often dissonant, his music rises to ferocious climaxes, relieved, especially in his later works, by lyrical oases (\"lyrische Inseln\").\nPettersson's music has a very distinctive sound and can hardly be confused with that of any other 20th-century composer. His symphonies, which range from 22 to 70 minutes long, are typically one-movement works.: 4   Pettersson's music is demanding on performers and listeners.\nPettersson quoted songs from his own 24 Barefoot Songs in several of his compositions.\nMusicologist Ivanka Stoïanova designed a theory of musical space about Pettersson's music.\nMost of his music has now been recorded at least once and much of it is now available in published scores.\n\n\n=== Works ===\nPettersson began composing songs and smaller chamber works in the 1930s.\nHis production from the 1940s includes the song cycle twenty-four Barefoot Songs (1943–1945) based on his poems and a dissonant concerto for violin and string quartet (1949), which is influenced by Béla Bartók and Paul Hindemith. Pettersson soon found his own compositional style.\nIn 1951, he created the experimental Seven Sonatas for two Violins. At the same time, he composed the first of his seventeen symphonies, which he left unfinished. This work has been recorded in a performing version prepared by trombonist and conductor Christian Lindberg in 2011.\n\nPettersson about the symphonic output of the 1950s: No one in the 1950s noticed, that I am always breaking up the structures, that I was creating a whole new symphonic form.\nIt took four years to write the conceptual and style-defining Symphony No. 6 (1963–1966). His Symphony No. 7 and Symphony No. 8 (1968–1969) have been recorded more than his other works and are probably his best-known. In the 1970s, he composed two related works about social protest and compassion, the Symphony No. 12 for mixed chorus and orchestra (1973–1974) to poems by Literature Nobel laureate Pablo Neruda with contemporary relevance and the cantata Vox Humana (1974) on texts by Latin American poets. During the prolific last decade of his life, he also wrote a concerto for violin and orchestra (1977–1978, rev. 1980) written for the violinist Ida Haendel, a Symphony No. 16 (1979) which features a bravura solo part for alto saxophone commissioned by American saxophonist Frederick L. Hemke, and an incomplete, posthumously discovered concerto for viola and orchestra (1979–1980).\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 1968–1969, conductor and composer Antal Doráti arranged eight of Pettersson's Barefoot Songs as full-scale orchestral songs.\nChoreographer Birgit Cullberg produced three ballets based on Pettersson's music. Rapport (1976, Symphony No. 7), Vid Urskogens rand (1977, Concerto No. 1 for String Orchestra), Krigsdanser (War Dance) (1979, Symphony No. 9).\nThe four orchestral sketches \"... das Gesegnete, das Verfluchte\" (1991) by Peter Ruzicka are a tribute to Pettersson's life and work, quoting sketches of his unfinished Symphony No. 17.\nRoy Andersson used the finale of Symphony No. 7 in his short film World of Glory (Härlig är jorden).\nAfter Pettersson's death, the Internationale Allan Pettersson Gesellschaft (International Allan Pettersson Society) issued six yearbooks, Classic Produktion Osnabrück CPO began recording his complete works, and a series of concerts (in 1994–1995) programmed almost all of them.\nIn 2002, a Swedish Allan Pettersson Society (Allan Pettersson-sällskapet) has been founded.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1970 Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music (Kungliga Musikaliska Akademien), No. 741\n1977 Litteris et Artibus\n1979 Professors namn (Honorary Professorship Royal Swedish Academy of Music)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe selected discography includes the original format of the recording and releasing label. Some of the LP releases have been reissued on CD. A 12-CD pack of the Complete Symphonies of Allan Pettersson has been produced by CPO (Classic Produktion Osnabrück) based on recordings of 1984, 1988, 1991–1995, 2004. In 2023, a cycle of all Pettersson symphonies produced by BIS Records was completed.\n\n\n=== Symphonies ===\nSymphony No. 1 (1951) (incomplete)\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Christian Lindberg (performing version by Christian Lindberg) (BIS CD) OCLC 749880192\nSymphony No. 2 (1952–1953)\nSwedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Stig Westerberg (Swedish Society Discofil LP and CD) OCLC 869139542\nBBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Alun Francis (CPO CD) OCLC 990776807, 610619988\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Christian Lindberg (BIS CD) OCLC 749880192\nSymphony No. 3 (1954–1955)\nRundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Saarbrücken, Alun Francis (CPO CD) OCLC 874528446\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Leif Segerstam (BIS CD) OCLC 987698874, 70480579, 875607794\nSymphony No. 4 (1958–1959)\nGöteborgs Symfoniker, Sergiu Comissiona (BIS LP)\nRundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Saarbrücken, Alun Francis (CPO CD) OCLC 874528446\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Christian Lindberg (BIS CD) OCLC 908174896\nSymphony No. 5 (1960–1962)\nBerliner Sibelius Orchester, Andreas Peer Kähler (Bluebell LP and CD) OCLC 18877225\nMalmö Symphony Orchestra, Moshe Atzmon (BIS CD) OCLC 873743666\nRundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Saarbrücken, Alun Francis (CPO CD) OCLC 990243222, 1057997291\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Christian Lindberg (BIS CD) OCLC 1034638954\nSymphony No. 6 (1963–1966)\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Okko Kamu (CBS LP) OCLC 725553097\nDeutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, Manfred Trojahn (CPO CD) OCLC 871953334\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Christian Lindberg (BIS CD) OCLC 945977705, 870662801\nSymphony No. 7 (1966–1967)\nStockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, Antal Doráti (Swedish Society Discofil LP and CD/London LP) (Grammis 1970) OCLC 872147110, 14964319, 45586363\nSwedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Sergiu Comissiona (Caprice CD) OCLC 29620951, 977971527\nPhilharmonisches Staatsorchester Hamburg, Gerd Albrecht (CPO CD) OCLC 60853163, 822857094\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Leif Segerstam (BIS CD) OCLC 874923816\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Christian Lindberg (BIS CD) OCLC 1034638954\nSymphony No. 8 (1968–1969)\nBaltimore Symphony Orchestra, Sergiu Comissiona (Polar LP and Deutsche Grammophon LP) OCLC 725716693\nRadio-Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, Thomas Sanderling (CPO CD) OCLC 638464541, 873571490\nPhilharmonisches Staatsorchester Hamburg, Gerd Albrecht (Orfeo CD) OCLC 249081425\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Leif Segerstam (BIS CD) OCLC 41557470, 317634279\nSymphony No. 9 (1970)\nGöteborgs Symfoniker, Sergiu Comissiona (Philips LP)\nDeutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, Alun Francis (CPO CD) OCLC 1058033816, 873438119\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Christian Lindberg (BIS CD) (Grammis 2015) OCLC 995556946\nSymphony No. 10 (1971–1972)\nSwedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Antal Doráti (EMI LP) OCLC 913186819\nNDR Radiophilharmonie Hannover, Alun Francis (CPO CD) OCLC 890524210, 871969453\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Leif Segerstam (BIS CD) OCLC 41557470, 317634279\nSymphony No. 11 (1971–1973)\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Leif Segerstam (BIS CD) OCLC 874492404\nNDR Radiophilharmonie Hannover, Alun Francis (CPO CD) OCLC 890524210\nSymphony No. 12 \"De döda på torget\" (\"The Dead of the Square\") (1973–1974)\nStockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, Stockholm Philharmonic Chorus, Uppsala University Chamber Choir, Carl Rune Larsson (Caprice LP and CD) OCLC 20358824\nSwedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Swedish Radio Choir, Eric Ericson Choir, Manfred Honeck (CPO CD) OCLC 873175780, 638445016, 70702259\nSwedish Radio Choir, Eric Ericson Chamber Choir, Norrköping Symphony Orchestra, Christian Lindberg (BIS CD) OCLC 1231565131\nSymphony No. 13 (1976)\nBBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Alun Francis (CPO CD) OCLC 990787167\nNorrköping Symphony Orchestra, Christian Lindberg (BIS CD) OCLC 933602262, 928103709\nSymphony No. 14 (1978)\nStockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, Sergiu Comissiona (Phono Suecia CD) OCLC 874190019, 658765036\nRadio-Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, Johan M.

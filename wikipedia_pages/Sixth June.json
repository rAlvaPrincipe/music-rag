    "text": "Sixth June are an audio/visual project from Berlin with origins in Belgrade, formed in 2007 by visual artist Laslo Antal and actress Lidija Andonov. All their releases have seen the pair explore multiple sides to their dark cinematic post new wave sound.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2009 Sixth June performed at EXIT Festival in Novi Sad. \n2010 they moved to Berlin and released their first album Everytime on German label Genetic Music and had appearance at BIMfest in Antwerp. The Sixth June Video “Oh no it's burning” was part of the Berlin Music Week. On sixth June 2011 they released the EP Back For A Day.\n2012 they were performing at Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Germany. 2013 they released the mini album Pleasure\nand had appearance at Nuit Fantastique in Brussels and Summer Darkness in Utrecht. After Berghain concert in 2014 the Berliner Zeitung describes their sound as \"sweet, cool, dark elektropop\" and close to Propaganda or Depeche Mode.\nMusic videos and live projections are a large part of the performance of Sixth June, adding a theatrical aspect. Having two people in the band who are closely connected to film, theatre and video art helps Sixth June to be recognizable not only by the music but the visual-image they create as well. \nAfter the release of their Pleasure EP (in December 2013), peek-a-boo magazine described their work as: The music from Laslo Antal and Lidija Andonov sounds indeed very 80’s, but at the same time contemporary as well. \nAfter hearing their brand new 5 tracks 12 EP Pleasure, I feel like to use these words again....\n\n\n== Name and influences ==\nSixth June's band name has no concrete reference to June 6 in history.

    "text": "Saul Goodman (July 16, 1907 – January 26, 1996) was the principal timpanist of the New York Philharmonic from 1926 to 1972.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGoodman was born in New York, the son of Polish Jewish emigrants, Abraham L. Goodman and Yetta Feigenbaum Goodman. He grew up in Brooklyn, and learned under the instruction of Alfred Friese. At the age of 19, Goodman succeeded Friese as principal timpanist in the New York Philharmonic. Goodman was a member of the faculties at the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal and the Juilliard School of Music where he taught many who went on to become timpanists in symphony orchestras around the world.\nDuring his career Goodman made innovations in drum and mallet construction, including a tuning system for drums and a line of timpani mallets, which Regal Tip began manufacturing in 1979. He played the first performance of a timpani concert to be broadcast. During his years at the Philharmonic, he lived in Yonkers, NY. \nHis wife was Lillian Rehberg Goodman, cellist, winner of Naumburg Competition (1931) and the president of Violoncello Society of New York (1972–1975).

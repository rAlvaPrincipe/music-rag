    "text": "Everlife was an American pop rock band made up of three sisters, Amber, Sarah, and Julia Ross which formed in early 2001.\n\n\n== History ==\nEverlife originated in Indiana, Pennsylvania. The band was formed in the winter of 1997 with Sarah on the drums, Amber on the guitar, and Julia on keyboard. In 2002, Everlife and their mother, Susan, shared a song with the band members of Seventh Day Slumber. The band members of Seventh Day Slumber lent their expertise by connecting them to music industry people in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2003, Everlife relocated to Nashville, with their parents, where they signed a single album record deal with Independent Records, and released their debut album, Daydream: An Acoustic Album. Then in 2004, their A&R contact, Gary Chapman, guided them to secure their second record deal. They were signed with Tovah Records, in association with Crowne Music Group, and released their self-titled second album: Everlife. The song \"I'm Over It\" caught the attention of KMKI, AM 620, the Radio Disney Station in Dallas, Texas.\nThe Buena Vista Music Group signed sister to Buena Vista Records and Hollywood Records. \"Find Yourself in You\", found prominent rotation nationwide on Radio Disney. They also sang the title song for the 2005 Disney original film, Go Figure. The Everlife album peaked at number 121 on the Billboard 200 chart.\nThey contributed songs to 12 Disney compilations, such as the Radio Disney Jams series and Disneymania. They were featured on four Disney film soundtracks and two Disney TV soundtracks. After leaving Buena Vista Records, they continued a strong relationship with Disney.\nTo celebrate Radio Disney's 10th Birthday Celebration, Disney held the \"Totally 10 Birthday Concert\" on July 22, 2006, where Everlife performed live, alongside Miley Cyrus, Aly & AJ, Bowling for Soup, Jesse McCartney, and the Cheetah Girls. They later opened for the Cheetah Girls' concert tour The Party's Just Begun Tour on the last few shows in 2007, and for Miley Cyrus on the last six dates of her Best of Both Worlds Tour, and the Jonas Brothers for their 2009 stop in Nashville. They have been on three tours of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nEverlife released their final album, At the End of Everything, in March 2013, before they officially disbanded to pursue solo careers.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Soundtracks ===\n2005 \"Strangers Like Me\" — from DisneyMania 3\n2005 \"I'm Over It\" — from Radio Disney Jams, Vol. 7\n2005 \"Go Figure\" — from Go Figure soundtrack\n2005 \"Strangers Like Me (Jungle Rock Remix)\" — from DisneyRemixMania\n2005 \"Every Day Is Christmas\" — from Radio Disney Jingle Jams\n2006 \"I Can See Clearly Now\" — from That's So Raven Too!\n2006 \"Look Through My Eyes\" — from DisneyMania 4\n2006 \"Real Wild Child\" (feat.

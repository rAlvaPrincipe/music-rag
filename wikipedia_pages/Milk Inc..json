    "text": "Milk Inc. is a dance music group that formed in the commercial dance scene in Belgium in 1996. The discography of the group includes a total of seven studio albums and 41 singles.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group started out as \"Milk Incorporated\" (\"La Vache\" for French-language releases), later shortening their name to \"Milk Inc.\" In its early days as Milk Inc., the band had also had a guitarist and harpist, John Miles Jr.\nThe band has had many line-up changes throughout its history. The band has found much success in Europe, with many of their singles charting in countries such as the Netherlands, United Kingdom, France and Spain. They are most successful in their native country Belgium, where they have 27 hit singles which have been in the Ultratop Chart, 22 of them being in the top ten and four of them being number ones. Furthermore, all of their seven albums have charted there, with two of them reaching number one. Milk Inc. is the current record holder for the number of TMF Awards in Belgium and the Netherlands, with a total of 17 awards received.\nIn 2006, to celebrate their 10th anniversary, Milk Inc. surprised fans with a two-hour live concert at the Sportpaleis Arena in Belgium.\nIn October 2014, Milk Inc. released the single Don't Say Goodbye. At the same time, the group announced that it would be taking an indefinite break. The reason for this was the birth of Linda's first daughter.\nIn April 2017, Linda Mertens' daughter died of cancer when she was only 2 years old. Regi stated that he wanted to give Linda all the time she needed to recover and that he did not want to pressure her to sing again. Regi continued composing and doing collaborations with other artists as well as solo. Linda did not return to music for several years.\nIn 2022, Linda returned to the stage during an event in Blackpool, United Kingdom. On October 27, 2023, Linda returned by surprise with Regi in a symbolic way at the Sportpaleis in Antwerp during the “Regi - The Return” concert.\nAt the end of the show \"The Return\", they announced a new concert in 2024 \"Regi vs. Milk Inc.\" for Saturday Nov 9th 2024, but due to quick sales (the date was sold out in few hours), they announced extra dates and they performed 7 times.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\n\n\n==== Regi Penxten ====\n\nRegi was born on 4 March 1976 at Hasselt in Belgium.

She was brought in by Regi Penxten in 1997 as a replacement for Sofie Winters as a singer for appearances. Karine Boelaerts, a Belgian studio singer, who was already working for other projects such as 2 Fabiola was hired to record all the songs.\nIn the middle of September 2000, Vervoort left Milk Inc. and moved to Ibiza with her boyfriend Patrick Claesen (alias Pat Krimson) producer of 2Fabiola, Nunca and Leopold 3, where they founded the record label Beni Musa Records.

Miles co-wrote songs with Regi Penxten and Filip Vandueren when he became a group member in 1997 and performed as their guitarist on stage. The first single he was involved in making, \"In My Eyes\", was a commercial success. This in combination with the voice of Karine Boelaerts brought the music to a new level. All the songs he co-wrote were published during his time at Milk Inc. At the same time Vervoort stopped as playback, Miles wanted to leave Milk Inc. as well. He accompanied the group until the beginning of 2001. In 2002, the group had two top ten hits in the UK with \"In My Eyes\" (UK #9) and \"Walk on Water\" (UK #10). In the years 2006–2008, he rejoined Milk Inc. as a guitarist on their Supersized and Forever shows at the Antwerp Sportpaleis. He has since gone on to join another Belgian dance act, Sylver, co-produced by Regi Penxten.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\nNote: Dates are approximate.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\n\n\n== Concerts in Sportpaleis ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nLinda Mertens official site\nRegi Penxten official site\nMilk Inc. at discogs.com"

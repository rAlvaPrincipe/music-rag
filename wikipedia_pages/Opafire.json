    "text": "Opafire was a jazz fusion group from San Francisco, California. Their debut album Opafire (RCA, 1991) sold close to half a million units worldwide.\nOpafire was created in 1990 by composer, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer Zachary Norman E. In 1990, Opafire signed a contract with RCA Records after Steve Feinstein, a program director in San Francisco began playing the group's music. When RCA/BMG released the debut album Opafire, it gained international success and heavy rotation radio airplay. The Opafire songs, \"Wajumbe\", \"Kalimbahari\", and \"Walk Like Rain\" reached the No. 2, No. 11, and No. 26 spots on the Gavin Report \"New Adult Contemporary Most Radio Plays\" chart and Top Ten spots in R&R magazine, as well as reaching charts in Germany, Italy, Japan, France, Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and Taiwan.\nIn 1991 Opafire toured with Miles Davis, Spyro Gyra, and the Yellow Jackets as part of the JVC Jazz Festival Tour, performing in venues with audiences of up to 12,000 people.\nOpafire headlined many music festivals, theaters, and clubs, such as the Oxfam International Festival Tour, the Whole Life Expo Tour, the Stern Grove Festival, the Great American Music Hall and Yoshi's Night Club in San Francisco and Oakland California, The Baked Potato in Los Angeles, as well as large \"Listener Appreciation Concert\" performances for various radio stations.\nIn 1998, the musical group Opafire was put on sabbatical by Zachary Norman E.

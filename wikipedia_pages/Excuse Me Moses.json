They competed in the Austrian selection process for the Eurovision Song Contest 2011, just narrowly missing out on a spot in the final, after coming 11th in the Online Selection, with the song \"Way Out\".\n\n\n== Band story ==\n\n\n=== Funkalicious ===\nThe band was formed in 2000 under the name Funkalicious. They produced the EP Deduction in 2002 and released their album Perfekta in 2004 which shortly appeared at #42 in the Austrian charts. They were unable to reach a broad audience with their funk rock music style. After Gerhard Bergauer had left the band in May 2005, Martin Scheer became drummer. Funkalicious redefined themselves as Excuse Me Moses and emphasized their style on rock music.\n\n\n=== Excuse Me Moses ===\nIn 2005, the band took part in the Ö3 Soundcheck band contest arranged by the Austrian radio station Hitradio Ö3. They reached third place. In the course of the promotion of the contest, the band played as a warm-up act at a concert of Bon Jovi and Nickelback in Innsbruck in May 2006.\nExcuse Me Moses signed a record contract and released their single \"Summer Sun\" which reached #33 in Austria.

In 1992, after Cool James went solo, the group was joined by the Ugandans Ken Kayongo and Charlie \"King\" Todwong.\nNigerian-born Dr. Alban signed them to his Sweden-based Dr Records in 1996. Singer Wayne \"Tatz\" Beckford from London joined the group. They produced the singles \"Malaika\", \"Nyama\", and \"Hakuna Matata\", for which they received a nomination to Channel O Music Awards in South Africa. \nThrough the popularity of \"Hakuna Matata\" in East Africa, Swahili Nation had a big influence on the use of Swahili language in R&B and hip hop.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwahili Nation - Pole - Music Video"

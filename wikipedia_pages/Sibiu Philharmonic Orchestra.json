    "text": "The State Philharmonic Orchestra of Sibiu (Romanian: Filarmonica de Stat Sibiu) is an orchestra from Romania.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 16th century, Sibiu had one of the first European schools for organ, funded by Hyeronymus Ostermayer and the city's archive contains music scores signed by composers of the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1774, at the court of Samuel von Brukenthal, governor of Transylvania, a professional orchestra held its first concert. In 1792, one year after Mozart’s death, Die Entführung aus dem Serail was played in Sibiu, and later in 1800, The Creation, by Joseph Haydn.\nThe State Philharmonic of Sibiu was founded on January 1, 1949. Together with the orchestra, artists from Romania and other countries have performed, among them: Ion Voicu, Valentin Gheorghiu, Ștefan Ruha, Monique de La Bruchollerie and Jean Jaques Thiollier, Sviatoslav Richter, Rudolf Kerer, Lazar Berman, Dimitri Bashkirov, Ivry Gitlis, and Montserrat Caballé.\nIn 2004, the location of the State Philharmonic of Sibiu was moved to Thalia Hall. Built in 1787 by Martin Hochmeister, the hall has been twice destroyed by fire during its history. The County Council of Sibiu restarted the restoration of the building in 1990. The official inauguration took place on October 7, 2004, with the music of the Symphony no. 9 by Ludwig van Beethoven.\n\n\n== The Orchestra today ==\n\n\n=== Conductors ===\nPast\nHenry Selbing\nPetre Sbarcea (1977-2014)\nGabriel Bebeșelea (2014-2017)\nCurrent\nVacant\n\n\n=== The Orchestra ===\nThe orchestra currently consists of: \nPiano: Monica Florescu\nCello: Makcim Fernandez Samodaiev, Alexandru Titus Tincu, Anca Demian, Claudia Grelus, Ina Turoiu, Zach Viorica, Silviu Chiorlise\n1st violin: Marius Radu - concert master, Sergiu Fidiles - concert master, Lilia Radu, Ilia Rusnac, Vasile Șulț, Ludmila Lungu, Raluca Sfîriac, Daniel Bădăruță, Irina Dancu, Cotîrlea Iuliana, Ioan Andrei Moldovan, Ștefana Zaharia, Teodorian Popa\n2nd violin: Elena Borz, Mihai Andrițcu, Ionuț Cristian Bugnar, Mădălina Tătărușanu, Eduard Dascaliuc, timea Gaudi, Costin Urlăeanu, Ioana Gavrilas, Andreea Baicu\nViola: Gabriel Silișteanu, Alina Stavăr, Aurelia Mailat, Mihaela Scheau, Terez Mihály, Tiberiu Maniu, Ioana Șulț\nDouble Bass: Valentin Desaga, Chirila Adam, Bartha Robert\nFlute: Oana Florentina Bădescu, Cozmin Demian, Coste Carina Maria\nOboe: Lucia Dobri, Romanino Lucian Popa, Oana Cristina Avram\nClarinet: Florin Grelus, Ciprian Dancu\nBassoon: Adam Raduly, Mircea Ittu, Ovidiu Borz\nHorn: Antonio Mihail, Barta Tivadar, Alin Roman\nTrumpet: Medve Sandor, Dorin Petcu, Dumitru Trocin\nTrombone: Ion Palagniuc, Radu Munteanu, Emanuel Dombi\nTuba: Daniel Luca\nPercussion: Andrei Marcovici, Alexandru Craciun\nHarp: Ileana Rotaru\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nwww.filarmonicasibiu.ro - Official site"

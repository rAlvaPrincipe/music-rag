    "text": "Ryosuke Hashimoto (橋本 良亮, Hashimoto Ryōsuke, born July 15, 1993 in Chiba Prefecture, Japan) is a Japanese singer managed by the male idol talent agency Johnny and Associates. He is a member of the boyband A.B.C-Z.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOn September 8, 2004, having passed an audition for Johnny's Jr., Ryosuke Hashimoto became a Johnny's trainee.  In the summer of 2005, he was selected as a member of Johnny's Jr. unit J.J. Express.  In 2008, he was selected to form the group TOP3 together with Yuma Sanada and Yuki Nozawa.\nOn August 29, 2008, Ryosuke Hashimoto was added to the Johnny's Jr. group A.B.C., renamed to A.B.C-Z when he joined.\nIn early 2009, the entertainment magazine Myojo named Ryosuke Hashimoto the number one \"Jr. I Would Like to Be My Boyfriend\". He also won the first place in the \"Best Looking\" category and the second place as the one \"I Would Like to Kiss\".\nOn February 1, 2012, Ryosuke's group A.B.C-Z had a major debut with a DVD titled Za ABC ~5stars~.\nIn 2012, Ryosuke acted in a television series titled Sprout, broadcast starting July 7 on NTV.\nSince April 6, 2013, he is appearing in a television drama series called Bad Boys J.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn July 31, 2008, the September issue of the tabloid magazine BUBKA published a paparazzi article about Ryosuke Hashimoto spotted at the cinema with Kanna Arihara from the girl group Cute. They went to see the movie Hana Yori Dango: Final. The publication might become the reason for Kanna's disappearance from Cute's activities in early 2009 and her subsequent retirement from the entertainment industry to \"return to the life of a normal girl\". Cute fans thought that she was pressured to leave by her talent agency. According to a women's weekly tabloid magazine reporter, the publication itself would not lead to Kanna's retirement, but she continued to date Ryosuke in secret after that. Instead of being punished after the scoop in BUBKA as rumors expected, on August 29, 2008, Ryosuke Hashimoto was added to the Johnny's Jr. group A.B.C., renamed to A.B.C-Z when he joined.\n\n\n== Johnny's Jr. groups ==\nJ.J.

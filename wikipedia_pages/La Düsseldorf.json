    "text": "La Düsseldorf was a German band, consisting of onetime Kraftwerk drummer and Neu! multi-instrumentalist Klaus Dinger and occasional Neu! collaborators Thomas Dinger and Hans Lampe.  La Düsseldorf was formed after Neu! disbanded following the release of their Neu! '75 record.  They released a string of successful albums (with sales totaling over a million) during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and were considered highly influential by Brian Eno and David Bowie, with Bowie going so far as calling La Düsseldorf \"the soundtrack of the eighties\".\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\n\n=== Core members ===\nKlaus Dinger – vocals, guitars, keyboards\nThomas Dinger – vocals, percussion\nHans Lampe  – percussion, electronics\n\n\n=== Other members ===\nHarald Konietzko (1978) – bass\nAndreas Schell (1978) – piano\nNikolaus Van Rhein (1976–1981) – keyboards (this is a pseudonym of Klaus Dinger.)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1976 – La Düsseldorf (Teldec Records)\n1978 – Viva (Teldec Records)\n1980 – Individuellos (Teldec Records)\nThe following albums were released by Klaus Dinger without the participation of any other band members.

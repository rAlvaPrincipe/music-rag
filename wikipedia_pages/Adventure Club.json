    "text": "Adventure Club is a Canadian electronic dance music duo composed of Christian Srigley and Leighton James, based out of Montreal, Quebec. The duo began as a hardcore pop-punk band before venturing into electronic dance music in 2011. They are best known for their remixes of \"Lullabies\" by Yuna and \"Crave You\" from Flight Facilities. The duo's debut album Red // Blue was released on 2 December 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe duo formed while attending high school in Montreal as a hardcore pop-punk band, but later decided to move on to electronic dance music after getting bored with the pop-punk sound and finding success with a dubstep remix of \"Daisy\" by American alternative-rock Brand New.\nThe remix climbed the charts on Hype Machine, a website that gathers popular songs from music blogs, which convinced them to make a change to producing EDM.\nSome of the major influences to their sound include TiÃ«sto, Flux Pavilion, Greeley Estates, Bring Me the Horizon and Skrillex. The duo's signature sound includes high-pitched female vocals with melodic sounds and heavy dubstep synths. Through online social network sites, the duo was able to increase their exposure by getting their first music video of \"Everything to Me\" by LIPS on the UKF Dubstep's YouTube channel. The remix was produced and directed by Cedric Sequerra of LuckyFish Productions.\nThe duo is signed under the management team of The Standard Group. Some of their signature sounds can also be credited to the program that they use to produce their music. Cakewalk SONAR is a less-commonly-used program in electronic dance music where FL Studio and Ableton Live are typically used. Some of the other equipment and software that they use include a Fireface console, Traktor Pro, Audio 6 and Kontrol X1.\nThe duo has toured across North America, as well as parts of Europe and Australia and have played at various music festivals including the 2015 American Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, Nevada. They also made their first appearance at the Ultra Music Festival 2013 in Miami.\nThe duo's remix of \"Crave You\" by Flight Facilities and Giselle Rosselli was featured in the episode \"Restraint\" (2012) of the MTV television series Teen Wolf.\nThe duo hosted a special volunteering event at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank in April 2014. They invited fans to come out for a meet-n-greet and to help package food for the poor.\nThe duo's single \"Rise and Fall (featuring Krewella)\" was featured on the MTV television series Eye Candy.\nThe duo's single \"Do I See Color\" was featured on a 2012 Coca-Cola commercial with dancer Marquese Scott.\nOn 2 December 2016, Adventure Club released their debut album titled Red // Blue, containing lead single \"Dreams\" featuring ELEA and \"Firestorm\" with Sara Diamond.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n\n\n=== DJ Mixes ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of dubstep musicians\nList of Montreal music groups\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdventure Club at AllMusic\nLeonard, Aex (December 12, 2011).  \"Adventure Club [Earmilk Exclusive + Interview]\".

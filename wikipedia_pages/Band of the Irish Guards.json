    "text": "The Band of the Irish Guards is one of five bands in the Foot Guards Regiments in the Household Division whose main role is to guard the British monarch. The Band supports the Regiment by providing the musical backing to which much of the ceremonial duties depend within Central London.\nUnlike the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards, which moves to various duty stations around the world, the Band is based permanently at Wellington Barracks in St James's, London.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Irish Guards was formed on 1 April 1900 to commemorate the bravery of the many Irish regiments which fought in the South African campaigns. Under the direction of its first Bandmaster, Warrant Officer Charles Hassell, the Regimental Band made its first public appearance the following year. The Band quickly gained a reputation for excellence as evidenced by the glowing press reports in 1905 for what turned out to be the first of many tours of Canada. The citizens of Toronto were so impressed with its performance that they presented the Band with an ornate silver cup, which remains one of its cherished possessions to this day.\nOn 23 January 1923, the Band made what is believed to be the very first broadcast by a military band, the programme being broadcast live on the 2LO station from a studio in Marconi House in The Strand.\nIn the 1950s the Band was chosen to give the UK premier performance of Paul Hindemith's 'Symphony for Concert Band'. In 1948, the Band travelled to Palestine to support the Guards battalions involved in the troubles. Sadly, during this time the Band was ambushed and one member, Lance Corporal Ted Jones, was shot and killed. He is buried in Sarafand Military Cemetery.\nThe Band has also made numerous appearances on television and in films, including The Ipcress File, and Oh! What a Lovely War, as well as being engaged to whistle 'Colonel Bogey' for the soundtrack of The Bridge on the River Kwai. A number of former Band members have continued their musical careers with national orchestras, including the Hallé, the BBC Symphony and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.\nTwo former Directors of Music, Major George Willcocks and Lieutenant Colonel 'Jiggs' Jaeger, also conducted the Black Dyke Mills Band at the National Brass Band Championships.\nOver the years the Band has toured extensively, including a visit to Japan in 1972, where it was accorded the honour of being the first foreign band ever to play in the Imperial Palace in the presence of the Empress and the two Crown Princesses.\n\n\n== Pipe majors ==\nOriginal title of \"Sergeant Piper\" was changed to \"Pipe Major\" via Army Order 139 of 1928, change to date from 31 July 1928. On St. Patrick's Day 1991, the Queen Mother presented the regiment with its first-ever pipe banner. This is carried by the pipe major on the bass drone of his pipes when a member of the Royal Family is present. In 2013, Pipe Major David Rogers became the first Irish Guards piper to be appointed \"Personal Piper to Her Majesty the Queen.\"\n\n\n== Ensembles ==\n\nThere are several ensembles within the Band of the Irish Guards:\n\nConcert band\nMarching band\nDance band\nFanfare Team\nOrchestra\n\"Shillelagh\"—Irish folk music band\n\n\n== Functions ==\nThe Band of the Irish Guards plays regularly at various events as part of the  Massed Bands of the Household Division; it can be found in London performing at the following occasions:\n\nChanging of the Guard\nTrooping the Colour\nBeating the Retreat\nThe Band represented the Household Division in the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo several times.\n\n\n== See also ==\nColdstream Guards Band\nGrenadier Guards Band\nScots Guards Band\nWelsh Guards Band\nHousehold Division\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIrish Guards Band - British Army\nIrish Guards Band\nIrish Guards Band"

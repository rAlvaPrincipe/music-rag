    "text": "Los Salvadores was a four-piece folk group from south east England. They performed across the United Kingdom and appeared at various festivals including Lounge On The Farm, Boomtown, Zoo Thousand, Endorse It in Dorset, Sellindge Music Festival and the Rochester Sweeps Festival.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe band originally formed as a loose folk punk collective in 2004, and went through many line-up changes before arriving at its acoustic, folk-influenced sound with the addition of Hannah Ellerby on violin and French horn player Vicky Price.\nDespite moderate success on the UK punk scene between 2004 and 2008 including high-profile support slots with Neck, Pronghorn, The Dangerfields and The Ghost of a Thousand, Los Salvadores continued to explore the folk elements in their music, eventually deciding to go fully acoustic in early 2009.\nThe first EP showcasing the new style was recorded at Barnroom Studios with Bernie Torme. Titled Wasps Birds and Clients, it featured four reworked songs and two new songs. Los Salvadores based many songs on Kent legends and history, such as the Smugglers Leap, and Bartholemew's Day, the story of the Battle of Sandwich (1217).\nThe band performed at a variety of folk clubs and festivals across the UK, and shared stages with a variety of artists such as Emily Barker and the Red Clay Halo, Jez Lowe, The Bad Shepherds, Eliza Carthy and Tunng.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nAttack of the Clones (2008)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nLos Salvadores (2005)\nIs This a Set Up?

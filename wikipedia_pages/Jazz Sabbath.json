    "text": "Jazz Sabbath is an English jazz trio, with a fictional backstory that they are from the late sixties. The band was created by Adam Wakeman, touring keyboard and guitar player for Black Sabbath (2004–2017) and Ozzy Osbourne band member (2004–present). Jazz Sabbath plays jazz renditions of Black Sabbath songs, claiming to be the original writers of those songs and accusing Black Sabbath of plagiarism.\nThe band first appeared in a mockumentary on YouTube in February 2020. In this short film band leader Milton Keanes (Adam Wakeman) was interviewed by actor Robert Powell about the early days of Jazz Sabbath, their cancelled debut album and the alleged theft of their songs by Black Sabbath. This album was later released as an actual album on 10 April 2020.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea for Jazz Sabbath started in 2013 on a night off in Berlin during one of the Black Sabbath tours, when Adam and Sabbath's security guard sat at the hotel bar early in the morning. The security guard asked if Adam could play the Sabbath set on the piano in the bar. Adam thought it would be fun to play the songs as jazz improvised versions and then played until the bar staff wanted to go home.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nJazz Sabbath (2020) \nReleased through Blacklake Records on 10 April 2020, the album contains jazz renditions of \"Fairies Wear Boots\", \"Evil Woman\", \"Rat Salad\", \"Iron Man\", \"Hand of Doom\", \"Changes\" and \"Children of the Grave\".\nPersonnel: In the album liner notes, the band members and session players are only mentioned by their fictional names:\n\nMilton Keanes – piano (Adam Wakeman)\nJacque T'fono – upright bass (Jerry Meehan)\nJuan Také – drums (Ash Soan)\nAlbum session players:\nWes Tostrayer – Guitar (Pete Rinaldi),\nSteven Stringer – Guitar (Simon McBride),\nChester Drawes– Guitar (Fraser T.

    "text": "Various, or Various Production, is an English dubstep/electronic music duo formed in 2002. The group blends samples, acoustic and electronic instrumentation, and singing from a revolving cast of vocalists. Its members, Adam and Ian, purposefully give very little information about the group or themselves, and tend to do little in the way of self-promotion. Nevertheless, the group began winning critical acclaim with its single releases in 2005 and 2006, with singers Rachel Thomas Davies and Nicola Kearey. Their full-length for XL, The World is Gone, arrived in July 2006. They have released a large number of vinyl EPs and 7\" records, as well as digital exclusives for Rough Trade, iTunes, and Boomkat. They have released remixes of a large variety of artists (sometimes uncredited) such as Thom Yorke, Adele, Virus Syndicate, Dave Cloud, Cat Power, Emma Pollock and Ian Brown and participated with one track on the Vexille Movie Soundtrack.\nIn 2002, the group started their own record label, called Various Records or Various Production, where they began releasing their own material, usually on 7\" or 12\" vinyl, or later as mp3 releases. In 2009 the duo started another label, called \"Misc\", this time for selling artworks and other products.\nThe duo signed a publishing deal with the newly formed Fire Songs in November 2007, a division of eclectic London-based record label Fire Records. In early 2009 they released a new LP, an experimental collaboration with poet Gerry Mitchell called The Invisible Lodger and signed the first act to release on the Various Production label, Gold Panda.\nAt some point during or prior to 2012, Ian Carter left the duo. He formed folk group Stick in the Wheel with previous Various collaborators Nicola Kearey and Rachel Thomas Davies, and has released music under the pseudonym EAN.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Album releases ===\nThe World Is Gone (XL Recordings, 17 July 2006)\nVersus (Various Production, 7 July 2008)\nThe Invisible Lodger (featuring Gerry Mitchell) (Fire Records, 23 February 2009)\n\n\n=== Vinyl releases on the Various Production label ===\nEuropean EP (12\", 2002)\n\"Cogmac\"/\"Queen Bee\" (7\", 2003)\n\"What About Them\"/\"Too Lost In You\" (12\", 2004)\n\"Turn it Up\"/\"No Win No Fee\" (12\", 2004)\n\"I'm Really Hot\"/\"Where I Belong\" (12\", 2005)\n\"Hater\"/\"Biker Walk\" (7\", 2005)\n\"Foller\"/\"Home\" (7\", 2005)\n\"Sir\"/\"In This\" (7\", 2005)\n\"Today\"/\"Go Beat\" (12\", 2006)\n\"Mr Clever\"/\"Lost (dub)\" (12\", 2006)\n\"Bruk\"/\"Home (edit)\" (7\", 2006)\n\"13\" (12\", 2006)\n\"Phortune\"/\"Limbs\" (7\", 2007)\nChief EP (12\", 2007)\nDiver (12\" EP, 2007)\n\"Meskman\"/\"Wot You Say\" (7\", 2008)\nVarious Production Remix EP (12\", 2009)\nKeep Her Keen (12\", 2009)\nTrycycle EP (12\", 2009)\n\"Learn Faster\"/\"Air\" (10\", 2012)\n\"Moving On\"/\"Bolts (12\", 2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

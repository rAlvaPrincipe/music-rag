    "text": "Raison d'être is a Swedish dark ambient project formed by Peter Andersson.\nThe name of the band was taken from a sentence in a book by Carl Gustav Jung: \"the individuation is the raison d’être of the self\".\nDark ambient atmospheres, drone elements, industrial sounds, ecclesiastical hymns are all blended together to constitute the music of Raison d'être. \nThe music produced by Raison d'être is variously dark ambient and soundscape in nature. For example, synthesizers might play a droning melody over the sound of metal scraping together. Andersson often mixes tapes of Gregorian chant with his own keyboard and percussion playing.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRaison d'être official website\nPeter Andersson official website\nDiscogs: raison d'être\nBandcamp: raison d'être"

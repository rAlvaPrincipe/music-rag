    "text": "Saint Four (セイントフォー, Seinto Fō) is a Japanese female idol group. Founded in 1984, the group was known for their color-coordinated outfits and use of acrobatics on stage.\n\n\n== History ==\nSaori Iwama, Noriko Hamada, Yukie Suzuki, and Yumiko Itaya were selected among 30,000 applicants by talent agency Nichigei Project (日芸プロジェクト, Nichigei Purojekuto) to form the idol group that would become Saint Four. The quartet made their debut in the 1984 film The Audition, which cost ¥4 billion yen to produce. Saint Four's debut single \"Fushigi Tokyo Cinderella\" (不思議Tokyoシンデレラ, \"Magical Tokyo Cinderella\") peaked at No. 35 on Oricon's singles chart and sold over 200,000 copies. Their second single \"Taiyō wo Dakishimero\" (太陽を抱きしめろ, \"Embrace the Sun\") sold over 150,000 copies while their debut album The Audition sold over 300,000 copies. The quartet inspired Kazuhiko Shimamoto to create the character team Battle Four (戦闘フォー, Sentō Fō) in his manga Blazing Transfer Student.\nAfter the release of the group's third single \"Heart Jack War\" (ハートジャックWAR) and third album We're Saint Four: Saint Four III (We're Saint Four~セイントフォーIII~) in September 1985, Nichigei Project sued Riv.Star Records for nonpayment of royalties. In September 1986, the Tokyo District Court ordered Riv.Star Records to pay Nichigei Project ¥388 million in compensation. Itaya left the group that year and was replaced by Jun Iwao.\nOn January 18, 1987, after two years and two months of activity, Saint Four performed their final concert at Maison Franco-Japonaise in Shibuya before disbanding.\n\n\n=== Post-disbandment ===\nFollowing the disbandment of Saint Four, Iwama continued her career as an actress. Hamada and Suzuki formed the rock duo Pink Jaguar (ピンクジャガー, Pinku Jagā). The duo released two singles and one studio album before going their separate ways in 1989 and pursuing careers as actresses. After leaving Saint Four, Itaya released several nude gravure books and videos before getting married and leaving the entertainment industry for good. Iwao continued her career as an actress and anime voice actress under her real name Junko Iwao.\nAfter interviewing Hamada and Suzuki, professional interviewer Gō Yoshida concluded that Saint Four was a scam, with the members paying a registration fee between ¥300,000 and ¥400,000, and they were not paid the monthly salary of ¥30,000. In addition, members were fined ¥100 for using certain words such as \"E~\" (え〜, lit. \"Huh?\"), \"Usso~\" (うっそ〜, lit. \"Not true!\"), and \"Yada~\" (やだ〜, lit. \"No!\").\nOn March 17, 2013, Iwama, Hamada, and Suzuki performed a reunion show at Kennedy House Ginza, marking their first show together in 26 years. While there were talks about a full Saint Four reunion, the TBS variety show Bakuho! The Friday (爆報! THE フライデー) announced on April 10, 2015 that Itaya could not be contacted.\n\n\n=== Reunion ===\nIn 2018, Iwama, Hamada, and Suzuki reformed Saint Four as a trio and released two compilation albums on May 16. Toki no Tabibito (時の旅人, Time Travelers) consists of two new songs and nine self-covers while Complete Collection 1984–1986 compiles the group's classic songs. In addition, the trio performed their first reunion show at Kennedy House Ginza on June 17.\nIn August 2021, Saint Four announced the suspension of activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nSaori Iwama (岩間 沙織, Iwama Saori) (born July 7, 1964) (1984–1987; 2018–present)\nNickname: Fashionable Saori (ファッショナブル・サオリ)\nColor: Green\nNoriko Hamada (浜田 範子, Hamada Noriko) (born February 22, 1965) (1984–1987; 2018–present)\nNickname: Dramatic Noriko (ドラマティック・ノリコ)\nColor: Pink\nYukie Suzuki (鈴木 幸恵, Suzuki Yukie) (born May 15, 1966) (1984–1987; 2018–present)\nNickname: Exciting Yukie (エキサイティング・ユキエ)\nColor: Blue\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nYumiko Itaya (板谷 祐三子, Itaya Yumiko) (born March 5, 1968) (1984–1986)\nNickname: Passionate Yumiko (パッショネート・ユミコ)\nColor: Red\nJun Iwao (いわお 潤, Iwao Jun) (born February 18, 1970) (1986–1987)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe Audition (ザ・オーディション) (November 17, 1984)\nYaru to Kya Yaru ze!

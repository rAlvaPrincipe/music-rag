    "text": "The Tokey Tones are a band led by Scott Mannion, formerly of Auckland indie pop bands Polaar and Plasticene. The Tokey Tones are primarily a studio-based band, the other long-time key member being Li Ming Hu, who is more widely known for her role as Li-Mei on the long running New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street. When playing live, The Tokey Tones rely on a revolving cast of musicians from other Lil' Chief Records bands, including The Brunettes and The Ruby Suns. The band has been described as \"sticky-sweet indie-with-electronics group with very strong melodies and melt-in-your-ear vocals\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNew Zealand Herald article on The Tokey Tones\nLil' Chief Records: The Tokey Tones\nLil' Chief Records"

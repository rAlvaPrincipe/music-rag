    "text": "The National Children's Orchestras of Great Britain, more commonly known as NCO, is a registered charity which provides orchestral training for children aged 8 to 14. The organisation comprises three age-banded orchestras and four project orchestras. Entry is by audition and every year approximately 500  young musicians are selected to play in the orchestras. It offers a life-changing experience to talented young musicians.\n\n\n== About the NCO ==\nThe NCO was founded in 1978 by Vivienne Price MBE.  Price, a violin teacher, had set up a number of local orchestras for children in Surrey but was acutely aware of the lack of national opportunities for younger musicians.  The National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain had existed since 1948 and there were many regional youth orchestras which catered for teenagers, but younger children struggled to fit in socially and so Price established the NCO.\n\n\n=== The Orchestras ===\nThere are three age-banded orchestras:\n\nMain Orchestra\nUnder 13 Orchestra\nUnder 12 Orchestra\n(There is an under 11s orchestra and it used to have a residential course, however, it recently has been cancelled, and assigned project orchestras, alike the regionals (see below))\n\n\n=== Projects Orchestras ===\nIn addition to the age-banded orchestras, there are four project orchestras that meet around the country for 2 weekends per year.\n\nProjects Orchestra rehearsals are for a more inclusive age and standard bracket. Typically the project orchestras use schools or universities such as Goldsmith University and have sharing at the end of the course. The project orchestras were introduced as something similar to the Regional orchestras after they were cut.\nThe regional orchestras were for national members and only-regional members and took place in six locations across the country on Sundays. In 2012, the organisation introduced an associate member scheme across all of their Regional Orchestras which gives talented youngsters who just missed out on an NCO place a chance to experience playing as part of a full symphony orchestra and to learn from members.  Regional Orchestra members met monthly during term time and give members additional opportunities to meet and rehearse new repertoire. Typically, each Regional Orchestra rehearses at a school or centre which is easily accessible and can provide facilities to accommodate a full symphony orchestra. Each Regional Orchestra performed for family and friends once a year.\n\n\n== Courses ==\nEach national orchestra meets twice a year at residential courses around the UK, where they receive training from leading music tutors and conductors.  Main and Under 13 Orchestras have an eight-day course in the spring and another eight-day course in the summer, both ending in a public concert in a major venue, as well as a non-residential winter weekend for the Main orchestra. the Under 12 Orchestra has 2 7-day courses a year with one private concert and one public after the second course. The courses are spent in sectionals and full orchestral rehearsals, preparing repertoire to be played at the end of course concert.  There is also time to explore other music and for recreation including something called surround sound.\n\n\n== Concerts ==\nEach course culminates in a concert. The younger orchestras perform for family and friends, while Main and Under 13 Orchestras perform in public at major concert venues. Performances have been given at Symphony Hall, Birmingham, Royal Albert Hall, Bridgewater Hall, Southbank Centre, The Sage Gateshead, Colston Hall, St David's Hall, Leeds Town Hall, Birmingham Town Hall, The Anvil, Basingstoke, Brighton Dome, Barbican Centre and Nottingham Royal Concert Hall.\nRepertoire for the concerts is varied and includes Classical, Romantic, 20th and 21st century music, as well as film scores. The NCO has commissioned, premiered and played new pieces by contemporary composers such as Matthew Curtis and Stephen Frost. The Orchestras have a reputation for tackling challenging repertoire. As of 2011, recent performances had included Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue and La Valse by Ravel (both performed by Main Orchestra) and Der Rosenkavalier Suite by Richard Strauss and Curtis' Paths to Urbino (performed by the U13 Orchestra).\n\n\n== Tours ==\nThe NCO has been on tour, to Italy in 2008 when Lady Susanna Walton (widow of Sir William Walton) invited Main Orchestra to play in the Walton's open-air theatre within the botanical gardens of La Mortella on the island of Ischia. They also played a concert to a packed audience in the Basilica di Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome.\nIn 2006 Main Orchestra toured to China where they took part in the International Festival of Music in Beijing. They performed in the Forbidden City Concert Hall and at the University of Beijing.\n\n\n== Alumni ==\nAfter leaving the NCO many musicians continue to pursue other musical opportunities. Typically, over half of the NYO players have previously been members of the NCO (86 out of 156 in 2010).  The BBC Young Musician of the Year 2010 competition featured 25 category finalists, 13 of whom had progressed through the NCO.\nMany alumni become professional musicians, some playing for leading orchestras and ensembles. As well as those who build successful careers as professional musicians, many other NCO alumni go on to excel in other fields â€“ medicine, law and engineering among others.\n\n\n=== Notable alumni ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of youth orchestras\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNational Children's Orchestras of Great Britain"

    "text": "Aesthetic Perfection is an American-Austrian electronic musical project created by Daniel Graves in 2000. It was formed in Los Angeles, California before moving to Linz, Austria.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAesthetic Perfection was formerly signed directly to Metropolis Records in the United States and Out of Line Records in Europe, until Graves decided to run it on his independent label Close to Human Records. Additionally, the band was licensed to Gravitator Records in Russia and Death Watch Asia in Japan.\nThe band's third album, All Beauty Destroyed, was released on November 4, 2011, in Europe and November 8, 2011, in the United States.\nOn March 29, 2019, Aesthetic Perfection released its sixth album, Into the Black. Unlike previous albums which were released by labels, Into the Black was self-released. According to Graves, this was an intentional move towards running the band free of label intervention, due to a belief that the label industry model was \"dying\". He has talked about his experience with the difficulties of touring, including minimal revenue, logistical issues and contract arrangements that require the band to front many costs which are only recouped if the tour is successful.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nDaniel Graves - vocals, keyboards, programming (2000–present)\nJoe Letz - live drums (2018–present)\nConstance Antoinette Day - live keyboards, guitars, bass (2021–present)\n\n\n== Former members ==\nElliott Berlin - live keyboards, synths (2010–2020), live keyboards, synths, guitars, bass, theremin (2019–2020)\nTim Van Horn - live drums (2009-2017)\nDavid Dutton - live keyboards (2008-2010, 2014–2017)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n=== Other appearances ===\n\n\n==== Remixes ====\n\n\n== References =="

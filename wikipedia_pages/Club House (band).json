    "text": "Club House were an Italian Italo house band formed in Italy in 1983. The group consisted of Carl Fanini, Gianfranco Bortolotti, Hidalgo Serra, and Silvio Pozzoli.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group scored a hit in 1983 with a mashup medley of Steely Dan's \"Do It Again\" and Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\", titled \"Do It Again Medley with Billie Jean\". It reached No. 7 in Ireland, No. 11 in the UK and No. 75 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The same two songs in Club House's 1983 medley were also recorded as a note-for-note dance medley by the Detroit, Michigan band Slingshot, which hit number-one on the dance chart with its cover version. There was a further version by Brooklyn Express, a New York studio project by Began Cekic and Eric Durham, also in 1983.\nIn 1987, Club House released another medley, mixing Mory Kanté's \"Yé ké yé ké\" with The Spencer Davis Group's \"I'm a Man\", a single licensed to Music Man Records in the UK, which became a small hit in 1989 peaking at number 69 in the British charts. In 1991, they hit number-one on the U.S. Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart with \"Deep in My Heart\", which used portions of Kier Kirby's vocals from Deee-Lite's 1990 single \"Power of Love\".\nClub House's biggest hit on the UK Singles chart came in 1994, when their single \"Light My Fire\" (featuring Carl Fanini on vocals) was remixed by Bortolotti's Cappella project and put out as a single by Pete Waterman's PWL record label. Originally a number 45 hit in the UK, the new Cappella version peaked at number 7 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1994 (though the first mix is remembered as the tune the original six man line-up of Boyzone danced to on RTÉ's The Late Late Show after just being formed). The follow-up single, \"Living in the Sunshine\", was not quite so successful as it only managed number 21 in the UK in July the same year.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nNowhere Land (The Album) (1995)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one dance singles of 1991 (U.S.)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClub House discography at Discogs"

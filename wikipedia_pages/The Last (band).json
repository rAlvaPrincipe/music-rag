    "text": "The Last is a Los Angeles–based band formed in 1976 by Joe Nolte with high school bandmates Vitus Mataré and Dave Harbison. By 1978 the band included three brothers: Joe (guitar, vocals), Mike (vocals), and David Nolte (bass guitar). They released several albums on SST Records, Bomp! Records and End Sounds.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was initially inspired by the nascent CBGB's scene as well as the first Modern Lovers album. Its sound was a mix of garage rock, surf rock, folk rock and psychedelic rock. The first settled line-up included Vitus Mataré (keyboards, flute), the Nolte brothers, and Jack Reynolds (drums). After three self-financed singles, the band was signed by Bomp! Records, who issued the debut album L.A. Explosion! in 1979 (described by Trouser Press as \"a near-perfect debut\"). \nIt was also issued in Germany (Line Records), Japan Trio/Trash Records), and the UK by London Records. \nThey recorded a second album, Look Again (1980), which was not released until 2020. The original members began to disappear until its demise in November 1985, with David Nolte joining Wednesday Week and later Lucky, and Mataré forming Trotsky Icepick. The band was considered a major influence on the psychedelia-influenced LA bands of the mid-1980s, including The Bangles and The Three O'Clock, as well as the South Bay punk bands such as Black Flag and the Descendents.\nJoe reformed the band in 1988 with Mike Nolte along with new members Luke Lohnes (guitar, vocals), Larry P. Manke (bass guitar), and Dave Nazworthy (of Chemical People) (drums). This line-up signed to SST Records, releasing three albums between 1988 and 1996. The early 1980s lineup of the band reunited for occasional reunion shows in Southern California between 2005 and 2013. That year, The Last released a new album for the label End Sounds featuring the Descendents/All rhythm section of Karl Alvarez and Bill Stevenson. \nThe Last remains active as of 2020. The current lineup was stabilized in 2019,\nand consists of:\nJoe Nolte: guitar, vocals\nJames Nolte: keyboard, vocals\nPhilo Van Duyne: guitar\nLisa Torres: bass\nPaul Rucker: drums\nJames Nolte is former bassist David Nolte's son and Joe's nephew.\nDavid Nolte has worked as a touring bassist, working with Dave Davies of the Kinks, David Gray, The Wondermints and many others.\nVitus Mataré went on to become a successful architect and record producer.\n\nAs of 2020, The Last planned to release the remixed and remastered version of Look Again, recorded in 1980. According to Amplify Music Magazine, In 1980, THE LAST recorded the album on their own to control the process as much as possible, but what they came out of the studio with was completely sonically wrong, receiving zero offers from record companies (interestingly, the original copy of the album has been going for over $800 on Discogs). So how exactly did THE LAST bring LOOK AGAIN back to life? As Vitus Mataré explains: “Those same master tapes have been carefully baked and transferred by John Strother at Penguin Recording in Los Angeles. Jonny Bell at Jazzcats Studio in Long Beach worked with the damaged files to restore the signals and performances that Joe and I knew were somewhere on those reels. There are no new overdubs and zero digital trickery. Guitar and organ tracks were sent to the same model amplifiers Joe and I used live back in the day and re-recorded. These are the original performances given a proper mix.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nL.A. Explosion! (Bomp!)

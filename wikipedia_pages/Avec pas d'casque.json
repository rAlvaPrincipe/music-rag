After adding a fourth member, Mathieu Charbonneau, Avec pas d'casque released their third album, Astronomie, on March 20, 2012. It was subsequently long-listed for the 2012 Polaris Music Prize, and was a Juno Award nominee for Francophone Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2013.\nLafleur is also a film director and screenwriter, whose films have included Continental, a Film Without Guns, You're Sleeping Nicole (Tu dors Nicole) and Viking.\nVaudreuil is an animator whose short film The River's Lazy Flow (Le courant faible de la rivière) won the Jutra Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 16th Jutra Awards in 2014, and whose full-length animated feature debut When Adam Changes (Adam change lentement) premiered in 2023.

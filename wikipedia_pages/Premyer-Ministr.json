    "text": "Premyer-Ministr (Russian: Премьер-министр, lit. Prime minister) is a Russian musical group. The idea behind the band was to form a boy band, though not especially for teenagers. Four men came together to form Premier Ministr in 1997. Their first real success came in 2000 with the remake of a Russian tune, \"Oriental Song\". \nIn 2001 one of the members, Dmitry Lanskoy, left the group for a solo career and was replaced.\nIn 2005, the group members split with their producer and started independent career as Group PM, while Premier Ministr was started anew with Taras Demchuk, Sergey Demyanchuk, Amarkhuu Borkhuu, and Vasily Kireyev.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Russian)"

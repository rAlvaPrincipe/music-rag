    "text": "Grits is a Christian hip hop group from Nashville, Tennessee. Their name is an acronym, which stands for \"Grammatical Revolution In the Spirit\". GRITS is made up of Stacey \"Coffee\" Jones and Teron \"Bonafide\" Carter, both of whom were DC Talk dancers.\nTheir song \"Ooh Ahh\" has appeared on the MTV show My Super Sweet 16. It is also used as the theme song of The Buried Life and on the soundtracks to The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and Big Momma's House 2. Their song \"Tennessee Bwoys\" was used on the popular television show Pimp My Ride. They were also involved in !Hero The Rock Opera. They recorded a remix of professional wrestler A.J. Styles' entrance music and performed it on the May 28, 2009, episode of TNA Impact!.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Christian hip hop duo began as dancers for DC Talk and then formed the group in 1995, with Teron David \"Bonafide\" Carter, (born January 17, 1971) and Stacy Bernhard \"Coffee\" Jones, (born September 8, 1972), forming the group together in Nashville, Tennessee. GRITS is an acronym with a meaning of \"Grammatical Revolution in the Spirit\". They both credited the inspiration for their rapping to hearing DC Talk, when the two first encountered each other in 1990. This is the reason the duo signed with Gotee Records, a label founded by DC Talk member, tobyMac, where they were one of his first signees. They are also considered to be one of the pioneering groups in the Christian hip hop movement, while they eventually started their own record label, Revolution Art, in 2007, where it was first known as 5E Entertainment. They explained it was like graduating from school by leaving Gotee Records, and founding their own label.\n\n\n== Style ==\nMainly, their style is alternative hip hop and Southern rap, while several of their songs have pop influences, thus an occasional pop-rap sound, and their song \"We Don't Play\" has a Jamaican influence complete with steel drums. They were one of the first acts signed to Gotee Records, and have released seven albums with Gotee, with an eighth one released by Gotee and AudioGoat. In 2014, Gotee Records announced that the GRITS song \"Ooh Ahh\" was RIAA Digital Gold Certified, having surpassed 500,000 downloads.  They have appeared at Cornerstone Festival and Rock the Universe. In addition their song \"Bobbin Bouncin'\" was added to the track list in the video-game Project Gotham Racing 4.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Remix albums ===\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n=== As lead artist ===\n\n\n== Other songs ==\nWith or Without You - In The Name Of Love: Artists United For Africa\nWedding Celebration - !Hero\n\n\n=== Vinyl ===\nThe Art of Translation (Single) (2002)\nThey All Fall Down (Redneck Remix) (Single) (2002)\nThey Al Fall Down (Ruff Nation Remix) (Single) (2002)\nIma Showem (Single) (1999)\nInstrumentals 1 (1999)\nInstrumentals 2 (1999)\nInstrumentals 3 (1999)\nThey All Fall Down (Original) (Single) (1999)\nFactors of the Seven (song) (1997)\n\n\n=== Guest Artists ===\nManchild - \"We Don't Play\"\nJennifer Knapp- \"Believe\" (Dove Award winning Rap/Hip Hop song of the year)\nTobyMac- \"Ooh Ahh\"; \"Say Goodbye\"; \"Don't Bring Me Down\"; \"Hey Now\"\nStefan the Scientist- \"Hittin Curves\"\nPettidee- \"I Be\"\nJason Eskridge- \"I Try\"\nAntonio Phelon- \"Love Child\"\nLisa Kimmey- \"It Takes Love\"; \"Shawty\"; \"Time To Pray\"\nIz- \"Jay Mumbles Mega Mix\" \"Dusk Till Dawn\"\nPigeon John - \"Open Bar\"; \"You Said\"; \"Beautiful Morning\"\nCanibus - \"Ambitions\"\nKJ52 - \"Integrity\"\nMac Powell - \"Fly Away\"\nMichael Tait - \"Fly Away (Remix)\"\nVerbs - \"U.S. Open\"; \"Hopes and Dreams\"; \"Gospel Rap; Parables\"; \"Strugglin'\"; \"C2K\"; \"Video Girl\"; \"Different Drum\"\nDan Haseltine - \"Sky May Fall\"\nJade Harrell-\"Turn it Up\"; \"Say Goodbye\"; \"Neverland\"\nBrittany Waddell (Better known as Britt Nicole) \"Rainy Days\" \"Soul Cry\" \"Right Back\" \"Dusk Till Dawn\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== GMA Dove Awards ===\nThey have received several Gospel Music Association Dove Awards throughout their career.

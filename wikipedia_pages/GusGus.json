    "text": "GusGus is an electronic music band from Reykjavík, Iceland.  Although initially a film and acting collective, the group is mostly known for its electronic music. The group's discography consists of twelve studio albums.\n\n\n== History ==\nGusGus was initially formed in 1995 as a film and acting collective. The band's name refers to the 1974 German film Ali: Fear Eats the Soul (German: Angst essen Seele auf) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, where a female character is cooking couscous for her lover, pronouncing it Gusgus. GusGus' music is eclectic, and although primarily classified as techno, trip hop, and house music, the band has experimented with other styles. They have remixed songs of popular artists such as Björk, Depeche Mode, Moloko, and Sigur Rós.\nMembership in the band has varied, and included:\n\nDaníel Ágúst Haraldsson\nEmilíana Torrini Davíðsdóttir\nMagnús Jónsson (aka Blake)\nHafdís Huld Þrastardóttir\nUrður Hákonardóttir (aka Earth)\nHögni Egilsson\nBirgir Þórarinsson (aka Biggi Veira or Biggo)\nMagnús Guðmundsson (aka Maggi Lego, Herb Legowitz, Hunk of a Man, Buckmaster De La Cruz, The Fox, Fuckmaster, or Herr Legowitz)\nStephan Stephensen (aka President Bongo, Alfred More, or President Penis)\nSigurður Kjartansson (aka Siggi Kinski)\nStefán Árni Þorgeirsson\nBaldur Stefánsson (Director of Financial Arts, aka DJ Tekno Jörgensen)\nRagnheiður Axel\nPáll Garðarsson\nIn 1997, the band performed in Toronto. They returned for a second visit as part of a tour supporting their second album, Polydistortion.\nIn 1998, a remix of the track \"Purple\" appeared on Paul Oakenfold's trance compilation Tranceport.\nAfter the group's third album, This Is Normal (1999), the filmmaking arm of GusGus (Kjartansson and Árni Þorgeirsson) split off to form the production company Celebrator, now known as Arni & Kinski, which has produced advertisements and videos.\nIn January 2004, they released the song \"Desire\" with Ian Brown.\nAs of 2011 the band had sold over 700,000 copies worldwide.\nIts 2015 incarnation consists of four members (President Bongo, Biggi Veira, Urður Hákonardóttir and Daníel Ágúst Haraldsson).

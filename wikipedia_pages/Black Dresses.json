They released their first single, a cover of M.I.A.'s \"Paper Planes\", in December 2017.\nThe duo released their debut album, Wasteisolation, in April 2018. The album was created entirely through online collaboration, with McCallion based in Toronto and Rook in Vancouver. Wasteisolation received positive coverage by Noisey, Stereogum and The Fader who called it \"a raw, abrasive, and deliriously catchy album about surviving as trans women in an antagonistic world.\" This was followed shortly by the EP HELL IS REAL, released in October of the same year. The EP featured in Stereogum's Best EPs of 2018 list, with the duo also featuring in the publication's list of best new artists.\nIn February 2019, Black Dresses released their second studio album, Thank You.

Hannah Jocelyn on Pitchfork stated: \"For a band that often writes about internalized shame and self-loathing, the resentment at the heart of this record feels more outwardly pointed.\" On September 30, 2022, the duo released a cover of the Scene Queen track \"Pink Panther\". An announcement was posted on their Twitter for their cover of \"Kill All Your Friends\", which was released the same day on October 17, 2022.\n\n\n=== 2023-2024: Laughingfish and final disbandment ===\nOn May 3, 2023, Black Dresses posted an announcement for a new single titled \"Gutz\" featuring Rirugiliyangugili.

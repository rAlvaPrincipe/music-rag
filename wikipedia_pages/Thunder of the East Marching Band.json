    "text": "The Thunder of the East is the marching band of the University at Buffalo in the State University of New York system.  UB's first marching band was created in 1920, and disbanded in 1927.  It was revived in 1946, increasing in size and reputation until about 1970.  It was known as \"The Pride of the East.\"  At that time, it was dissolved upon UB's departure from Division I athletics.  In 1981, some UB students continued the tradition of playing music at UB's home football and basketball games by forming UB's Pep Band.  In anticipation of UB's return to Division I athletics, a marching band was formed in 1999 and named, \"Thunder of the East.\" The band debuted at the University at Buffalo Stadium on September 11, 1999.  The Thunder of the East is currently led by James E. Mauck; and performs at UB's Buffalo Bulls home football games, as well as in other musical venues.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first marching band at the University at Buffalo was formed in 1920 by 15 students. At that time, performances were limited to a few concerts, and marching during the school's football games. The band eventually dissolved in 1927, but many attempts were made to revive it. The band was re-formed in 1946 by Gerald Marx. A saxophone player, Marx brought together around 50 players to play and march at university football and basketball games. They also played concerts around the area, including one in Kleinhans Music Hall, home of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1952, The Air Force ROTC Band took over the marching duties on campus, leaving the university band only non-marching duties.\nIn 1956, the newly formed music department at the university took over the marching band after the ROTC band failed to meet expectations during its existence, and upon the insistence of UB's president, Clifford C. Furnas. Robert Mols, PhD, led this new band, writing the current fight song, \"Victory,\" that is heard at football games and basketball games today. Mols wanted the band to be comparable to Ivy League marching bands, creating uniforms that resembled uniforms of the Ivy Leaguers of the day. The band opened to much success and fanfare thanks to the efforts of Mols and the band's many weeks of practice before their premiere. In 1959, Buffalo Philharmonic member Lowell Shaw took over leading the marching band; Mols went back to conducting the university Concert Band. In 1961, the band again changed leaders with Frank J. Cipolla at the helm. The University purchased new uniforms and a new version of the Alma Mater was written. It was at this time that the band acquired its first nickname, \"Pride of the East.\" In 1968, the band had the distinction of being the first group on campus to move to the new North Campus to what is now Bissell Hall. In 1969, the band marched in Richard Nixon's inauguration parade. Between 1961 and the early 1970s, the band grew from only 50 members to over 300 members. The university joined the SUNY system in 1962, eventually leading to the elimination of the football team and with it the need for a marching band.\nIn 1981, a small group of students created a pep band for the then Division III football team. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the band grew to become a Student Association group, so beginning the University at Buffalo Blue Noise Pep Band. During this time, there was talk of restarting the marching band, however it never developed. In 1999, football returned to Division I.  With this, the university decided a marching band was again a necessity.  Mark Flynn was made the director, and with the efforts of Kappa Kappa Psi, many local high schools, and Student Affairs, the Thunder of the East made its debut on September 11, 1999. In 2000, the band began its second season with new uniforms and new words to Victory March written by Mols, the original composer. It's believed that there were never any words for the original song. In the fall of 2001, the band made its first road trip in nearly 30 years to West Point to cheer on the Buffalo Bulls at Army's Michie Stadium.\n\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThe Thunder of the East is a Drum Corps style band that incorporates traditional marching band instrumentation.

Students are able to move into their assigned dorms prior to camp, allowing them to avoid the rush and chaos of university-wide move in day.

The band then marches down the road, playing in parade formation, to UB Stadium where it will perform at 1–2 different tailgate parties and the Blue and White Club.  While marching, the band plays selections from its halftime show.  When the band arrives at the stadium, it takes the field to perform a pre-game show, but not before the members enjoy some pre-game glizzies, water, and an apple.  The band then goes to its section in the stadium, next to the student section and plays typical game tunes along with some of its halftime show.  At halftime, the band performs its show facing the home crowd on the west side of the stadium.  After the performance, the band returns to the stands to again join the crowd cheering on the Bulls.

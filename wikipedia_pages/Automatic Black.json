    "text": "Automatic Black is a rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2001-2003 Formation ===\nThe band formed in 2001 when Vocalist Jeff Darr returned from Europe and met Drummer Tom Chambers and Bassist Steve Kitabjian through mutual friends. Guitarist Stevie D. finalized the lineup after he felt a calling to the band because both the group's members and music had similar feel to his own struggles and hardship.\n\n\n=== 2003-2004 Minor popularity and De-Evolution ===\nIn 2003, Automatic Black was the opening act for Kiss and Aerosmith on the second leg of their Rocksimus Maximus Tour.\nTheir debut album, De-Evolution, intended to be released on April 6, 2004 under Arista Records, was never formally released due to financial difficulties; however, their song \"Crash and Burn\" was featured in the EA game Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 and their song \"Go Your Way\" was officially released as a single on January 19, 2004.\n\n\n=== 2005-2007 Lineup changes ===\nAfter not getting their debut album formally on the market and getting released from Arista Records, members Stevie D. and Tom Chambers left the band. Stevie D. reformed the band Buckcherry with long time friend Josh Todd and Tom Chambers left due to differences between him and Jeff Darr.\nRikki Lixx (Richard Thomas) took over on Guitar for Stevie D. With Rikki Lixx they released a few non-album singles on their Myspace such as \"What Else\"; (However they can no longer be found on their website).\nRikki Lixx left Automatic Black that year to join Rev Theory. He was then replaced by Mark Biondi.\n\n\n=== 2008-2009 Nashville and Automatic Black EP ===\nThe group released their self-titled EP in 2008 on independent label Nashville NOiR, and again on September 1, 2009 on independent Nashville record label Per Capita Records.\n\n\n=== 2010-Present Hiatus ===\nThe band has been on an unofficial hiatus as of 2011, however in 2013 they released the previously mentioned fan favorite \"Crash and Burn\" on their Myspace page.\n\n\n== Discography and Singles ==\nApril 6, 2004: De-Evolution \n\nDementia\nRadio Edit\nCrash and Burn\nNo Brain\nAntiseptic\nLow\nGo Your Way\nN.T.I.L.\nBurn Out\nLovely Thing\nAshtray\nSeptember 2008 - September 1, 2009: Automatic Black\n\nNo Matter What\nRuined Everything\nBitch Is Dead\nWhite Trash Vacation\nThe One\nSingles\n\nCrash and Burn - September 22, 2003, re-released 2013\nGo Your Way - January 19, 2004\nWhat Else - 2006\nNo Matter What - 2009\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nJeff Darr - Vocals, Rhythm Guitar (2001–Present), Lead Guitar (2001-2003)\nSteve Kitabjian - Bass, Backing Vocals (2001–Present)\nMark Biondi - Lead Guitar, Backing Vocals (2006–Present)\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nTom Chambers - Drums, Percussion, Backing Vocals (2001-2005)\nStevie D. - Lead Guitar, Backing Vocals (2003-2005)\nRikki Lixx - Lead Guitar (2005-2006)\n\n\n=== Studio Musicians ===\nDan O'Neill - Bass, Backing Vocals (2003) on De-Evolution\nDan Showell - Guitar, Backing Vocals (2003) on De-Evolution\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAutomatic Black at Last.fm\nAutomatic Black at Purevolume\nhttp://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/automatic-black/2869204"

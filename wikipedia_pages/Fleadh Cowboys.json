    "text": "The Fleadh Cowboys are a Dublin-based folk-rock/country band.\nThe Fleadh Cowboys were formed in 1985 by Johnny Moynihan, Pete Cummins and Frankie Lane, in Kenny's pub in Westland Row in Dublin. They recruited Jimmy Faulkner on electric guitar and Garvan Gallagher on bass and along with Fran Breen on drums they moved to The Harcourt Hotel on Harcourt Street.\nAdding Phil Donnelly and Paul Kelly amongst others, they had a long-running residency in Dublin's Olympia Theatre.

The individual musicians continued to play and record in different formations. Paul Kelly and Frankie Lane, accompanied by Eleanor Shanley, play and tour together in Ireland and throughout Europe. Pete Cummins (the band's main songwriter) released his debut solo album The Brilliant Architect in 2008 to critical acclaim. His anti-war song \"Flowers in Baghdad\" was in the Neil Young anti-war charts Living with War, for almost two years. He continues to tour with guitarist Ger Kiely.\nIn May 2011 the band was reformed by Pete Cummins to organize a charity event at Dublin's Button Factory, with guests Lisa Hannigan, Gay Woods, Liam Ó Maonlaí, Henry McCullough, Siobhán O'Brien, Mundy, Tír na nÓg and others.\nOn 3 March 2013, Pete Cummins once again reformed the band this time to honor one of its own past members Guitarist Henry McCullouhg.

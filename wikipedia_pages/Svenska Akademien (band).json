    "text": "Svenska Akademien is a Swedish reggae band formed in 1999 by Carl-Martin Vikingsson, Simon Vikokel and Kristoffer Hellman. Since the band dissolved in 2009, Carl-Martin Vikingsson has released two solo albums as \"Sture Alléns Dansorkester\". Svenska Akademien vocalist and toaster Ivan Olausson-Klatil aka \"General Knas\" has released three solo albums, the first one in June 2006 called \"Äntligen har rika människor fått det bättre\" (\"Finally rich people's conditions have improved\") and the latest one in 2012, called \"Kärlek & Revolt\" (\"Love & Rebellion\").\nAlthough some people consider their music to be politically green and leftish, they have stated on their website that \"Svenska Akademien doesn't have its own ideology, or some kind of manifest approved by its members.\"\nOn 1 February 2013, it was announced that Svenska Akademien would make a comeback, with an upcoming album and new tour dates.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2001 Snapphaneklanen (EP)\n2002 Med anledning av\n2004 Tändstickor för mörkrädda\n2005 Resa sig opp\n2005 Upphovsmännen till den skånska raggan (compilation album)\n2007 Gör det ändå!\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2001 Snapphaneklanen\n2002 Rötter\n2004 Psalm för mörkrädda\n2005 Du vill så du kan\n2007 Vakna\n\n\n== Members ==\nKenneth Björklund\nIvan Olausson-Klatil aka General Knas\nAgnes Olsson\nJohan Pettersson aka Räven\nLars Thörnblom\nCarl-Martin Vikingsson aka Sture Allén d.y.\nSimon Vikokel aka Don Cho\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

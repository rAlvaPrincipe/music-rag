They enjoyed a highly successful career mainly during the first half of the 1970s, producing numerous hit singles including \"Awazu ni Aishite\", \"Uwasa no Onna\",\"Soshite, Kōbe\", \"Nakanoshima Blues\" and \"Tokyo Sabaku\". They lost popularity after the departure of their frontman in the late 1980s, and their career went into hiatus after the band lineup was radically altered around the 1990s.\nAfter the band's founder died of lung cancer in 2006, the remaining members, including Maekawa, reunited.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Charting singles on the Japanese Oricon ===\n\nThe group released over 50 singles until Kiyoshi Maekawa left the band in 1987, and those sales have been estimated more than 5.9 million copies.\n\n\n== Kōhaku Uta Gassen appearances ==\n\n\n== References =="

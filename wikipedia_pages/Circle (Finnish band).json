    "text": "Circle is a Finnish experimental rock band formed in Pori in 1991. Their eclectic, ever-changing style has been associated with genres such as krautrock, heavy metal, progressive rock, and ambient. On some albums they have defined themselves as New Wave of Finnish Heavy Metal (NWOFHM).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCircle was formed in 1992 by bassist and singer Jussi Lehtisalo, the only member who has been in the band throughout its career. Circle's krautrock-style debut album Meronia was released in 1994 and featured lyrics in a made-up language. A trio of albums, Andexelt (1999), Prospekt (2000), and Taantumus (2001), brought them international attention. Since recording 2002's Sunrise, the core line-up has consisted of Lehtisalo with keyboard player and singer Mika Rättö, drummer Tomi Leppänen, and guitarist Janne Westerlund, playing more heavy metal-oriented music though continuously influenced by krautrock band Faust. Since 2009, Julius Jääskeläinen and Pekka Jääskeläinen have appeared on all recordings by the band. Sound engineer and musician/composer Tuomas Laurila is also credited as a member of the band on a number of releases.\nCircle member have participated in a great number of side projects and split-offs, including stoner rock spin-off Pharaoh Overlord. Rättö and Lehtisalo play as a duo, Rättö ja Lehtisalo, and as a trio with Kauko Röyhkä. Other projects featuring members of Circle include Steel Mammoth, Ektroverde, Janne Westerlund's Plain Ride, Lusiferiinin Armosta, K-X-P, Aavikko, Lehtisalofamily, Split Cranium Moon Fog Prophet, and Doktor Kettu.\nWhilst recording the album Miljard in 2006 the band was filmed by Esko Lönnberg, and the resulting movie, Saturnus Reality released as a DVD, by No Quarter Records (2007). Lönnberg's attempt to make the film itself became the subject of another movie, The Man With The Video Camera, filmed by Petri Hagner, which has also been released as a DVD by Fonal Records (2010). The band are also closely associated with the filmmaker Mika Taanila: in 2011, they provided a live soundtrack to his 1998 silent film Pori (released as an album, Suur-Pori); and in 2012 recorded several new tracks for Six Day Run, also released subsequently as an album.\nIn 2011, Circle/Pharaoh Overlord were artists-in-residence at Dutch rock festival Roadburn Festival. The group made its 32nd full-length album, Terminal, available for streaming on Soundcloud shortly before its official release on Southern Lord Records on 23 June 2017.\nIn November 2021, Circle released Henki, a collaborative album made with English musician Richard Dawson, on Weird World (an imprint of Domino Recording Company).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1994 Meronia, CD/2LP (Bad Vugum), 2007 CD re-issue (Ektro Records)\n1996 Zopalki, CD/2LP (Bad Vugum), 2012 CD re-issue (Ektro Records)\n1996 Hissi, CD (Metamorphos / Captain Trip Records (Japan))\n1997 Fraten, CD (Metamorphos)\n1998 Pori, CD (Metamorphos), 2000 CD (Feldspar (USA))\n1998 Kollekt, compilation CD (Bad Vugum)\n1999 Andexelt, CD (Metamorphos), 2000 CD (tUMULt)\n2000 Prospekt CD (Ektro Records), 2002 2LP (Static Resonance)\n2001 Taantumus, CD (Bad Vugum)\n2002 Sunrise, CD (Ektro Records), 2006 2LP (Headspin)\n2002 Alotus, CD (Klangbad)\n2003 Guillotine, CD (Ektro Records), 2005 CD (Scratch)\n2004 Forest, CD (Ektro Records), 2005 CD (No Quarter)\n2005 Tulikoira, CD (Ektro Records), 2007 2LP + 7\" (Headspin)\n2006 Miljard, 2CD (Ektro Records)\n2006 Tyrant, CD (Latitudes)\n2007 Tower feat.

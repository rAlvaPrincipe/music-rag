    "text": "The Vienna Symphony (Vienna Symphony Orchestra, German: Wiener Symphoniker) is an Austrian orchestra based in Vienna. Its primary concert venue is the Vienna Konzerthaus. In Vienna, the orchestra also performs at the Musikverein and at the Theater an der Wien.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1900, Ferdinand Löwe founded the orchestra as the Wiener Concertverein (Vienna Concert Society). In 1913 it moved into the Konzerthaus, Vienna. In 1919 it merged with the Tonkünstler Orchestra. In 1933 it acquired its current name. Despite a lull in concert attendance after the introduction of radio during the 1920s, the orchestra survived until the invasion of Austria in 1938 and became incorporated into the German Culture Orchestras. As such, they were used for purposes of propaganda until, depleted by assignments to work in munitions factories, the orchestra closed down on 1 September 1944.\nTheir first post-war concert occurred on 16 September 1945, performing Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 3. Under the direction of Josef Krips, they quickly rebuilt a modern repertoire after ten years of isolation, and travelled to the Bregenz Festival for the first time in the summer of 1946.\nThat year marked the beginning of the tenure of Herbert von Karajan who, though not principal conductor, worked with the orchestra in the \"Karajan Series\" concerts, going on extensive tours throughout Europe and North America. During the 1950s the orchestra made recordings with Hermann Scherchen and F. Charles Adler including several first recordings of Gustav Mahler's symphonies. In 1959, the orchestra performed for Pope John XXIII at Vatican City, leading up to the debut of Wolfgang Sawallisch.\nSawallisch's leadership saw a tour of the United States in 1964 as well as a combined U.S.-Japan tour in 1967. It also included the re-opening of the Theater an der Wien in 1962. Krips returned as artistic advisor in the interim between Sawallisch's departure and the arrival of Carlo Maria Giulini as principal conductor. In 1986, Georges Prêtre became principal guest conductor, and served until the arrival of Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos as principal conductor in 1991. Vladimir Fedoseyev became chief conductor in 1997 and served in the post until 2005. Prêtre and Sawallisch each held the title of Ehrendirigent (honorary conductor) of the orchestra until their respective deaths. Fabio Luisi was principal conductor from 2005 to 2013.\nIn October 2011, Philippe Jordan was named the orchestra's next chief conductor, effective with the 2014–2015 season, with an initial contract of 5 years In December 2016, the orchestra announced the extension of Jordan's contract as chief conductor through the 2020–2021 season. The orchestra has begun its first CD commercial cycle of recording of the Beethoven symphonies with Jordan. Jordan concluded his tenure as chief conductor at the close of the 2020–2021 season.\nAndrés Orozco-Estrada first guest-conducted the orchestra in 2006. In March 2018, the orchestra announced the appointment of Orozco-Estrada as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2021–2022 season, with an initial contract of 5 years. He took the title of chief conductor designate for the 2020–2021 season.  Following reports that the orchestra had planned not to extend his initial contract and conflicts with upper-level management, Orozco-Estrada resigned as chief conductor on 12 April 2022, with immediate effect.\nMarie Jacquot first guest-conducted the orchestra in 2020.  In March 2023, the orchestra announced the appointment of Jacquot as its next principal guest conductor (Erste Gastdirigentin), the first female conductor to be named to the post, effective with the 2023–2024 season.  In June 2023, the orchestra announced the appointment of Petr Popelka as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2024–2025 season, with an initial contract of five seasons.\n\n\n== Chief conductors ==\n\nFerdinand Löwe (1900–1925)\nHugo Gottesmann (1929–1933)\nOswald Kabasta (1934–1938)\nHans Weisbach (1939–1944)\nHans Swarowsky (1945–1947)\nHerbert von Karajan (1948-1964) (Artistic Director)\nWolfgang Sawallisch (1960–1970)\nJosef Krips (1970–1973; Artistic Director)\nCarlo Maria Giulini (1973–1976)\nGennady Rozhdestvensky (1980–1982)\nGeorges Prêtre (1986-1991)\nRafael Frühbeck de Burgos (1991–1996)\nVladimir Fedoseyev (1997–2005)\nFabio Luisi (2005–2013)\nPhilippe Jordan (2014–2021)\nAndrés Orozco-Estrada (2021–2022)\nPetr Popelka (2024–present)\n\n\n== Conductors laureate ==\nGeorges Prêtre\nWolfgang Sawallisch\n\n\n== Other affiliated conductors ==\nWilhelm Furtwängler (1927–1930; as director of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde)\nHerbert von Karajan (1948–1964; as director of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde)\nMarie Jacquot (2023–present; Principal Guest Conductor)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nVienna Symphony at AllMusic"

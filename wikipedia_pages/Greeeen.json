    "text": "Gre4n Boyz (stylized as GRe4N BOYZ), until March 2024 named Greeeen (stylized as GReeeeN), is a Japanese all-male vocal group from Kōriyama in Fukushima Prefecture, comprising the four members: HIDE, navi, 92 (read as \"kuni\"), and SOH.\nThey debuted with Universal Music Japan in 2007. Their previous logo depicts a mouthful of teeth, with the four \"e\" representing both the number of members and their dental background, as all of them graduated from the Faculty of Dentistry. Sound production is overseen by HIDE's older brother JIN, formerly a guitarist of Pay money To my Pain. Their official catchphrase, according to their Universal Music Japan website, is \"Rock 'n' Breakbeat with four microphones.\" \nAll members of Gre4n Boyz attended the dentistry department at Ohu University in Koriyama City, Fukushima Prefecture. Notably, the group debuted while still students in 2007. By 2010, each member had obtained a dental license and commenced practicing dentistry in Kōriyama. In 2019 they were appointed as 'Frontier Ambassadors' for Kōriyama city, highlighting their significant contributions to the local community.\nA defining characteristic of Gre4n Boyz is their steadfast commitment to anonymity. Throughout their career, none of the members have ever revealed their faces in any public appearances, be it in promotional videos, CDs, television performances, or online platforms. This dedication to secrecy was particularly evident during their sole TV performance on TV-U Fukushima's Music Bar Palo Palo, broadcast on January 19, 2007, where the group took measures to censor their faces. Despite their immense popularity, the identities of the members remain shrouded in mystery. Initially, there were indications that they might unveil their faces after all members passed the 2009 dental license exam. However, by late 2009, they firmly stated their intention to maintain anonymity to protect their careers as dentists from potential interference. As a result, Gre4n Boyz's faces have never been made public, fueling speculation and curiosity among fans about the individuals behind the music. This enigmatic aura adds to their allure and mystique, further cementing their status as one of Japan's most intriguing musical acts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2002–2005: Formation and career beginnings ===\nHIDE began his music career as a member of a Japanese hardcore band in his junior high school.

Evidence from HIDE's blog suggests that his brother JIN contributes to composition using a computer. During the early collaboration between HIDE and navi, they recorded vocals with the assistance of JIN's band, producing a mixture rock style heavily influenced by Western acts such as SUBLIME and SUGAR RAY. Although their musical roots initially leaned towards pop, HIDE and navi decided to explore a mixture genre to align with their evolving tastes.\nUpon SOH joining in 2004, their musical direction shifted to incorporate the sensibilities of all four members, blending elements from diverse genres including rock, breakbeats, hip hop, reggae, and J-pop. Their debut single \"Michi\" serves as a quintessential example of Gre4n Boyz's musical fusion, combining breakbeats and band sounds with piano, emotive melodies, and harmonies from all four voices.\nWhile the debut single \"Michi\" is credited to HIDE for both writing and composition, the coupling track \"Kizuna\" is written by HIDE and composed by JIN. Other songs are attributed to Gre4n Boyz collectively. However, HIDE's blog suggests ambiguity regarding the specific contributions of each member to writing and composing. Notably, tracks like \"DREAM\" from \"HIGH GK LOW ~ Hajikero ~\" and selections from the album \"Ā, Domo. Ohisashiburi Desu.\" such as \"SUN SHINE !!!,\" \"Matane,\" \"Sayonara Kara Hajimeyou,\" and \"Tobira\" feature navi on lead vocals.\n\n\n=== Lyrics ===\nGre4n Boyz is renowned not only for their musical compositions but also for their poignant and heartfelt lyrics. The hallmark of Gre4n Boyz's lyrical style is its ability to deliver messages that resonate deeply with listeners' hearts, a characteristic referred to as \"GReeeeN Music.\"\nTheir lyrics are characterized by simplicity, driven by the desire to convey messages directly to the listener in a way that evokes empathy and understanding. According to navi, each individual has their own unique circumstances, but the universal appeal of Gre4n Boyz's lyrics lies in their ability to connect with listeners on a personal level. By using lyrics and melodies as a form of communication, Gre4n Boyz creates moments where listeners can find solace and understanding in their own experiences. This approach makes their songs easy to comprehend, straightforward, and allows listeners to relate their own situations to the music.\nFurthermore, it has been revealed that 92, one of the members, contributed to crafting some of the lyrics. This collaborative effort underscores the depth and authenticity of Gre4n Boyz's songwriting process, reflecting the collective experiences and perspectives of the group members.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== Japan Gold Disc Awards ===\n\n\n=== Japan Record Awards ===\n\n\n=== Student Voice Awards ===\n\n\n=== Yahoo!

    "text": "Tone Mason is a Canadian hip-hop and R&B production team from Toronto, Ontario, composed of Mellenius, Don D, and formerly, Aloysius Brown. They have contributed their music to MuchMusic & MuchVibe (theme music for The Vibe, The Downlo), Barbershop: The Next Cut, BET, EA Sports, Russell Peters' Red, White and Brown and many more.\n\n\n== History ==\nDon D. began his career in the 1990s as a member of underground hip hop group Nefarius. He served as the group's DJ and producer. After the death of group member MC Kwesro in 1999, he and MC Collizhun (the other member) released an EP, Tough Dumplin' Foundation For Better Beats, before eventually parting ways. Before the fall of Nefarius, he met Aloysius Brown and Mellenius, and the three acted as \"production protégés\" for each other. Don D. thought it would be shameful for their material to go unheard, so they formed Tone Mason.\nIn 2003, the group produced \"Back Where I've Stayed\" for Choclair's Juno Award-winning album, Flagrant. They also produced Fantasia Barrino's hit single \"Hood Boy\" in 2006.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"The Throwback\" ft.

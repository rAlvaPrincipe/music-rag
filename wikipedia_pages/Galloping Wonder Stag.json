    "text": "Galloping Wonder Stag (native name Vágtázó Csodaszarvas, 2005–present) is a Hungarian music group, associated with world music, psychedelic folk, folk rock and shamanic music labels, continuing Galloping Coroners psychedelic music replacing electronic guitars and drums with acoustic folk instruments.\n\n\n== History ==\nGalloping Wonder Stag has been founded by Attila Grandpierre, leader of Galloping Coroners (1975–2001) in 2005. The band has about 10–12 members, most of them folk musicians. They use acoustic instruments e.g. tapan, derbuka, violin, bagpipe, folks wind instruments, doublebass, tambura, cister and kobsa.\n\n\n== Style ==\n\nGalloping Wonder Stag can be categorized either as a unique subgenre of world music or a derivate it from Galloping Coroners' shaman punk, as an acoustic, folk-instrumented, neotraditional shaman punk that made one step closer to original shamanic music and folk music.  Galloping Wonder Stag use ethnographic materials as manuals on how to reach and communicate ecstatic states. Galloping Wonder Stag plays ancient psychedelic shaman music coming from the oldest roots of Hungarian folk music at Eurasian nomad horse people's tradition.\nGalloping Wonder Stag's music is built on band leader Grandpierre's past experiences with Galloping Coroners replacing rock instruments (electric guitars, drum) with acoustic folk instruments. Grandpierre's lyrics praise Hungarian prehistoric culture.\n\n\n=== International reputation ===\nGalloping Wonder Stag is especially famous for its live performance.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nPure Source (2006)\nEndless Asia (2008)\nStar Ride (2011)\n\n\n== Members ==\nPure Source (2006)\nAttila Grandpierre – vocals\nBotond Bese – bagpipes\nKálmán Balogh – cimbalom\nFélix Benke – drums\nRóbert Benkő – double bass\nMátyás Bolya – lute\nTamás Geröly drums\nBernadett Márton – vocals\nKrisztina Molnár – violins\nSzabolcs Róka – lute\nBalázs Szokolay Dongó – winds\nEndless Asia (2008)\nAttila Grandpierre – vocals\nBernadett M.

    "text": "Git Fresh (formerly known as DeepSide) is an American R&B and hip hop group based in Miami, Florida. They are currently signed to Island Def Jam. The group was initially composed of Rude Boi, Pretty  Sly, Penny, & Mike Ezay.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years: DeepSide ===\nThe group started out and formed when all the band members were in their teenage years, singing at talent shows and parties around the city. With the exception of Pretty Sly, who went to school in Miami, they all went to Dillard Performing Arts School. Rude Boi met Sly at a local talent show in Miami and introduced him to Mike and Penny. There was an immediate chemistry between the guys and they officially formed the group, DeepSide.  Formerly signed to Jive Records, the group  known as DeepSide changed their name after splitting from the label, and all old ties.\n\n\n=== Git Fresh ===\nThe group changed their name from DeepSide to Git Fresh in 2008. They also have changed record labels from Jive Records to Def Jam. Unfortunately, the singers, Brent \"Penny\" Pendergast & Mike \"Ezay\" Espinosa, have reportedly left the group. As of 2012, it is uncertain if the two remaining members will continue as a group.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2002: DeepSide\n2008: Git Fresh\n2011: Eat It Up\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nAs DeepSide\n2002: \"Shook\"\n2002: \"Shook\" Remix\n2003: \"Fantaszin'\"\n2005: \"Coochie\" (featuring Young Noah & Pety Pablo)\n2005: \"Hot Like an Oven\" (featuring Juvenile)\n2006: \"Lovely\" on the Step Up (Original Soundtrack)\n2007: \"Let's Make Love\" (featuring Papoose)\n2007: \"What I Need\"\nAs Git Fresh\n2008: \"Booty Music\"\n2008: \"Like a Women\"\n2009: \"Tipsy\" (featuring Rick Ross)\n2009: \"SwaGG Up\" (featuring Jamie Foxx and Rick Ross)\n2010: \"She Be Like (Bom Bom Bom)\" [Available on iTunes now]\n2010: \"What Them Girls Like\" (featuring Flo Rida)\n2011: \"Eat It Up\"\n2011: \"No Girlfriend\"\n2011: \"Jump Off\" (featuring New Boyz)\n2012: \"Ocho Cinco\" (Child Please)\n2013: \"Leavin with Me\"\n2015: \"Don't You Move\"\n\n\n=== As featured artist ===\n2010: Flo Rida - \"Why You Up in Here\" (featuring.

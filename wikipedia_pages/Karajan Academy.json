    "text": "The Karajan Academy is a music academy in Berlin, Germany, associated with the Berlin Philharmonic, that trains young orchestral musicians.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Academy is a non-profit organization, financed by donations; its work is supported by a voluntary board and an advisory board. Originally named the  Orchester-Akademie der Berliner Philharmoniker, it was founded in 1972 by Herbert von Karajan (1908â€“1989), conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, to train young musicians for the orchestra. Those whose musical education was mostly based on a solo repertoire could improve themselves in the community of the orchestra's musicians.\nIn May 2017, at a meeting of the orchestra, it was agreed that the Academy would be renamed after Herbert von Karajan.\n\n\n== The course ==\nAbout a third of the current members of the Berlin Philharmonic have come through from the Academy. The two-year course, available for players of all orchestral instruments, is at the same time a postgraduate course and an internship. The student receives personal tuition, usually from the concertmaster or section leader; regularly takes part in orchestral rehearsals and concerts; becomes familiar with chamber music, of which the repertoire includes classic, romantic and classic modern works; and is trained to prepare for auditions.\n\n\n== References =="

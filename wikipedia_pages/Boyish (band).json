    "text": "Boyish is an indie rock duo that got its start in Boston before relocating to New York City in 2019. The group currently consists of lead vocalist India Shore, vocalist and guitar player Claire Altendahl.\nThe band was formed by Shore and Altendahl for an audition at Berklee College of Music under the moniker The Blue before changing their name to Boyish. They have released two studio albums to date: Carnation and Garden Spider. The former was nominated for an Independent Music Awards, featured in the New Yorker, and now streamed over 1 million times. The single 'FUCK YOU HEATHER' from Garden Spider premiered on Atwood Magazine and was played over 3,500,000 times on Spotify. In February 2021, Boyish released \"Superstar\" the first track off their upcoming EP We're all going to die, but here's my contribution, which was released on May 28, 2021 with four tracks. It received positive write-ups from Lyrical Lemonade, Highclouds, and Atwood Magazine. Additionally, the song currently has over 1,600,000 streams and was added to several editorial playlists such as Lorem, All New Indie, Indie Pop & Chill, and Fresh Finds.\nOn May 27, 2022, Boyish released EP My Friend Mica, which was preceded by singles \"Smithereens,\" \"Congratulations,\" and \"I Think I Hate It Here.\" Shore and Altendahl said of their inspiration of the project, \"we didnâ€™t have a concept beyond what was happening in our lives at the time\" and \"The whole EP is like one long journal entry, or a stream of consciousness of the past year. We really tried to take the emotions we were currently wrestling with and direct them into these songs\".\nIn June 2023, Boyish released a single titled \"Kill Your Pain\", featuring King Princess. They went on to join her as the opening act for her European tour.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nBoyish at AllMusic\nBoyish at Bandcamp\nBoyish discography at Discogs"

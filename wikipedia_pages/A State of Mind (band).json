Since 2019 they are signed to Chinese Man Records, a French Indie-label run by band Chinese Man.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band members met in Frankfurt am Main, where they went to school together. They soon started listening to Hip Hop music and were influenced especially by Old-school hip hop.\nThey first gained international recognition for collaborating with Wax Tailor and made an appearance on his albums Hope & Sorrow and In The Mood For Life in 2007 and 2009. Soon after they released their first EP Pre-Emptive Nostalgia which they had produced together with Skrein.\nASM's first solo-album Platypus Funk was released in 2010, followed by their second album Crown Yard in 2011. In 2015 they released their most ambitious and successful project to date, the album The Jade Amulet, a narrative album set in the fictional ancient kingdom of Vabaria. The story is spun around Shalim, last of the clan Tan Suo, spoken by FP. Green T guides from a narrative perspective through the album, other artists like MF DOOM as the tyrant King Dumile, Mattic as the king's son Rongon The Conqueror as well as other artists (Mighty Diamonds, Laura Mayne, Kain The Poet, Astrid Engberg, and Lilliboy Deluxe) set characters into music. The album was realized with the help of an orchestra. Additionally they created a beer, which shall resemble Belko Brew, a fictional beverage from Vabaria, and a comic book for the story.\nIn 2016 ASM turned to their roots in boom bap again, leading to their EP String Theory. In 2017 the groups MC's accompanied Chinese Man, a Trip hop trio from Marseilles, on their Shikantaza-tour, following their signing to Chinese Man Records in 2019.

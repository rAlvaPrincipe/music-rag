It was formed by Bennie Pete, Jerome Jones, and Harry Cook in 1995, the merging of two earlier bands, the Looney Tunes Brass Band and the High Steppers Brass Band.\nSince June 2007, the band has been signed to the UK's Tru Thoughts label, that label's first U.S. act.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe Hot 8 Brass Band plays in second line parades hosted Sunday afternoons by Social Aid and Pleasure Clubs; in the New Orleans metropolitan area they also play at traditional jazz funerals and at local jazz nightclubs.\nThey play regularly at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and have played in the Zulu Parade, San Antonio Zulu Association Festival, the City of New Orleans New Year's Celebration and Mo' Fest, the Tom Joyner Morning Show, and the Master P music video \"Hootie Hoo\".  The Hot 8 Brass Band has also toured in Japan, Italy, France, Spain, Finland and England.\nIn the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the Hot 8 Brass Band was propelled to wider prominence by an appearance in Spike Lee's 2006 documentary When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts.  Because of this appearance, according to National Public Radio, \"A new legion of fans caught onto the band's mix of traditional marching music, hip hop, and R&B.\"\nIn 2009, the band added its New Orleans style to an \"Iko Iko\" cover song of the Swiss band Schtärneföifi, who re-recorded their Swiss German version from 1995's Heicho – Ohni Znacht is Bed together with The Dixie Cups in New Orleans.

According to a local news source:\n\nAccording to New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) accounts, officers were stopping 22-year-old trombonist Joe Williams for driving an allegedly stolen vehicle when Williams slammed the white Ford F-150 into reverse, accelerating into an NOPD squad car and officer. His actions, says Deputy Superintendent Marlin Defillo, caused officers to fear for their lives and thus open fire, killing Williams.\nThe same source reported that several eyewitnesses say that police shot Williams while he was unarmed and his hands were in the air.\nIn 2006, drummer Dinerral \"Dick\" Shavers was shot and killed while driving with his family.  According to The Times-Picayune:\n\nDinerral Shavers, 25, died from a gunshot to the back of his head at about 5:30 p.m. while behind the wheel of his black Chevrolet Malibu in the 2200 block of Dumaine Street…  His family was not injured…  Although critically wounded, Shavers continued driving four blocks up Dumaine before stopping.  By 6 p.m., Shavers lay motionless on his back in the middle of the street just outside the open driver's side door…  Shavers was taken to a hospital, but died within an hour.\nPolice said the bullet was intended for Shavers's fifteen-year-old stepson. The Hot 8 Brass Band played at Shavers' funeral.\nBennie Pete died in September 2021 from complications from sarcoidosis and COVID-19.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nLeland, Jacob (August 2011). \"The Hot 8 Brass Band: Home in My Horn\".

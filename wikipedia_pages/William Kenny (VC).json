Twice previously he had saved machine-guns by carrying them out of action, and on numerous occasions he conveyed urgent messages under very dangerous circumstances over fire-swept ground.\n\n\n== Other honours ==\n\nIn addition to the Victoria Cross, Kenny earned the rank of Drum-Major and was also awarded the following medals: Queen's South Africa Medal with bars, King's South Africa Medal with bars, 1914 Star with bar, British War Medal, Victory Medal with oak-leaf, Delhi Durbar Medal, and the Cross of St George (Russia).\nOn 20 March 1999 the grave of William Kenny received a new headstone in the Corps of Commissionaires plot at Brookwood Cemetery, arranged by The Gordon Highlanders London Association (Lt Col. M.H. Burge). Kenny was buried in 1936 but unfortunately the original marker was lost and until this stone was placed, Kenny was not otherwise commemorated.\nHis Victoria Cross and other medals are on displayed at the Gordon Highlanders Museum, Aberdeen, Scotland.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nIrish Winners of the Victoria Cross (Richard Doherty & David Truesdale, 2000)\nMonuments to Courage (David Harvey, 1999)\nThe Register of the Victoria Cross (This England, 1997)\nVCs of the First World War: 1914 (Gerald Gliddon, 1994)\n\n\n== External links ==\nLocation of grave and VC medal (Brookwood Cemetery)\nThe Brookwood Cemetery Society (Known Holders of the Victoria Cross Commemorated in Brookwood Cemetery)"

On April 26, 4Minute released the fourth mini-album Name Is 4Minute and the single \"What's Your Name?\", which was produced by Brave Brothers. Promotion for the single and album involved a set of teaser images where the members were decorated in fantasy-inspired sets and neon tones.

In an interview with Newsen, a Cube Entertainment spokesperson said that the song was \"neither a sexy or charismatic concept, but a cute concept – a hip hop dance song that goes well with the summer feel.\" Its Korean title \"물 좋아?\" (romanized: Mul Joha?, lit. \"How's the Water?\"), is a slang phrase that men use to ask if the girls in a club are hot. KBS announced that the lyrics for \"Is It Poppin?\" were unqualified for broadcast because they contained the English word \"ass\". 4Minute planned to remove the word from the video for re-evaluation. Billboard K-Town columnist Jeff Benjamin tweeted whether the Brave Brothers' new thing was to sample old-school-sounding R&B. Benjamin also noted that similarly to \"What's Your Name,\" \"Brave Brothers uses a similar formula for 4minute's new track, but it all feels smoother.\" He explains the track \"uses subdued snares, a twinkling Ellie Goulding \"Lights\"-esque sample and a soft, recurring vocal sample. Despite sounding busy on paper, the song flows nicely together as a sweet little blend of R&B and electro-pop.\" The song peaked at number 9 on the Gaon Digital Chart and number 6 on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100, selling 606,713 digital downloads. In September, 4Minute finished its contract with Universal Music Japan, and shut down the group's Japanese official website as well as its fanclub site, 4Nia Japan.\nOn January 20, 2014, Brave Brothers released the single \"Only Gained Weight\" which featured 4Minute members Hyuna, Gayoon and Sohyun; the song reached number five on the Melon chart and Gaon.

The duo composed of rapper Duane \"Snupe\" Lee and producer/DJ Michael \"Mike G\" Getmore and was a subgroup of the rap collective Hieroglyphics.\nExtra Prolific was the Hieroglyphics' second group to splinter from the collective after the Souls of Mischief and like them, signed a deal with Jive Records.  The duo recorded their debut album Like It Should Be which was released in late in 1994. The album spawned a minor hit in \"Brown Sugar\". Mike G left the group while Snupe kept the Extra Prolific name and continued to release music under the name into 1998.\nSnupe released a new album Like It's Supposed To Be under the Extra Prolific name in March 2020.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLee Majors on Youtube"

    "text": "Schwein (German for pig as well as pork) is a music group comprising members of Buck-Tick, KMFDM, and Pig. Members Raymond Watts (PIG; vocals, programming, guitar) and Hisashi Imai (Buck-Tick; guitar and noise), both having worked together in Schaft, were joined by Atsushi Sakurai (Buck-Tick; vocals), Sascha Konietzko (KMFDM; vocals and programming) and Lucia Cifarelli (KMFDM; vocals). In 2001 Schwein released an album, Schweinstein, which peaked at number 18 on Oricon's album chart, followed by the remix album Son of Schweinstein. Schwein toured Japan in the summer of 2001. However, Konietzko did not tour with them, citing illness and a desire to focus on KMFDM. In a 2023 interview with Visual Music Japan, Raymond Watts talked about the project and cited Schwein as his favorite collaboration to date and called Sakurai a \"grand vocalist\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio album ===\n\n\n== Schweinstein (2001) ==\n\n\n=== Remixed album ===\nSon of Schweinstein (2001)\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Official members ===\nRaymond Watts - guitars, programming, vocals (PIG, Schaft, KMFDM)\nAtsushi Sakurai - vocals (Buck-Tick)\nHisashi Imai - guitars, noises (Buck-Tick, Schaft)\nSascha Konietzko - programming, vocals, percussion (KMFDM)\n\n\n=== Guest musicians ===\nLucia Cifarelli - vocals (KMFDM)\nJules Hodgson - guitars, bass, programming (KMFDM)\nChris Ignatiou - guitars (One Minute Silence)\nKazutoshi Yokoyama - Manipulate, Additional programming (Buck-Tick touring member)\nJulian Beeston - Additional programming\n\n\n=== Touring members ===\nBryan Black - keyboards\nArianne Schreiber - backing vocals\nAndy Selway - drums (KMFDM)\n\n\n== References =="

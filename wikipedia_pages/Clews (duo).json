Lily, the elder sister, began writing songs at age 15.  The sisters were introduced to music at an early age; their father and his brother formed a band called Brother, which toured throughout the United States in the 1990s and 2000s. During this time, the sisters followed their father on tour, living in the United States for several years. The band released their first single, Museum, on February 23, 2018. They have since released many additional singles.\nThe sisters cite Oasis, Crowded House, The Beatles, The Strokes and Jeff Buckley as influences, among others. The band has been praised for their vocal harmonies and lyricism, with Tone Deaf describing their songs as \"beautifully crafted poems, where the listener becomes adrift on a river of pure magic.\" Triple J asserts that CLEWS' songs will \"make your heart explode.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nLoveluck Omens (2021)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Museum\" (2018)\n\"Crushed\" (2018)\n\"Crushed II\" (2019)\n\"Hollywood\" (2019)\n\"New Age\" (2019)\n\"Feel\" (2020)\n\"Want You That Way\" (2021)\n\"Overluck\" (2021)\n\"The Aftergone\" (with Holy Holy) (2021)\n\"Lean Across\" (2022)\n\"Everything Is Heavy\" (2022)\n\"Better Than Before\" (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

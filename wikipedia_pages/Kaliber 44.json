    "text": "Kaliber 44 is one of the biggest Polish hip hop groups, formed in 1993 in Katowice. The group is dubbed the most influential Polish hip hop band, while their so-called hardcore psycho rap style is the most prominent. As revealed by Abradab in an interview aired on TVP, \"the name comes from the time we weren't completely sane and played gangsta\". Later on members provided a revised interpretation: first part of the name indicates the calibre of problems the group sings about. The number 44 is a reference to a prophetic poem Dziady written by Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz.\n\"Księga Tajemnicza. Prolog\", released in 1996, was the first Polish hardcore psychorap album and the second one where live-scratching technique was used. Their two other albums – \"W 63 minuty dookoła świata\" (released in 1998) and \"3:44\" (released in 2000) were completely devoid of psychorap style. Their last album was their last album was titled \"Ułamek tarcia\" and was released on March 2, 2016. \n\n\n== Piotr Łuszcz ==\nSoon after release of the second album \"W 63 minuty dookoła świata\" Magik retired from Kaliber 44, and formed new band called \"Paktofonika\" together with Sebastian \"Rahim\" Salbert and Wojciech \"Fokus\" Alszer.\nOn 26 December 2000, at around 6:15, \"Magik\" committed suicide by jumping out of the window of his apartment situated on the ninth floor of the building, in Katowice.

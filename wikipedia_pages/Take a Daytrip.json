    "text": "Take a Daytrip is an American record production and songwriting duo composed of Denzel Baptiste \n(born January 9, 1993) and David Biral (born February 22, 1993). They are best known for producing singles such as Sheck Wes' \"Mo Bamba\", Lil Nas X's \"Panini\", \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\",  and \"Industry Baby\" (featuring Jack Harlow), Juice Wrld's \"Legends\", and Travis Scott and Kid Cudi's \"The Scotts\", all of which peaked in the top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100. They are also known for their iconic producer tag \"Daytrip took it to ten\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe duo met while Baptiste and Biral were attending New York University and started producing in 2014. In 2016, they collaborated with Rockstar Games to produce the score of the Grand Theft Auto Online update; 'Import/Export'. They have produced many hit singles, with their first notable track being \"Mo Bamba\" by Sheck Wes in 2017, which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. Their highest-charting singles currently are \"The Scotts\" by Travis Scott and Kid Cudi and \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" and \"Industry Baby\" by Lil Nas X, both of which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. \n\n\n== Legal issues ==\nIn October 2019, two Atlanta producers, Don Lee and Glen Keith Demeritt III, claimed that the Lil Nas X and Cardi B song \"Rodeo\" was a copy of the song \"Broad Day\" by Puerto Reefa and Sakrite Duexe, which they produced. The two sued Lil Nas X, Cardi B, and Take a Daytrip. The case ended when it was dismissed with prejudice by the court.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"I Don't Mind\" (with Treez Lowkey) (2017)\n\"Fiji\" (with Sam Austins) (2017)\n\"Stressed\" (with Octavian) (2019)\n\"Louis\" (featuring Jesse) (2019)\n\"Lighthouse\" (featuring Rico Nasty, Slowthai, and Icecoldbishop) (2019)\n\n\n=== Featured singles ===\n\"Raw Emotions\" (with Stolar) (2017)\n\"Poison\" (Octavian featuring Take a Daytrip, Obongjayar, and Santi) (2020)\n\"Soda\" (DJ Scheme featuring Cordae, Ski Mask the Slump God, and Take a Daytrip) (2020)\n\"Y Don't U\" (Park Hye Jin featuring Clams Casino and Take a Daytrip) (2021)\n\n\n== Production discography ==\n\n\n=== Charted songs ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTake a Daytrip at AllMusic\nTake a Daytrip on Twitter"

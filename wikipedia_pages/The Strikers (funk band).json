    "text": "The Strikers were a 1980s funk/disco band from New York City. They had greatest success with two 1981 singles \"Body Music\" (#4 on the\nUS dance chart) and \"Inch by Inch\" (#15). In The Boston Phoenix, critic Mike Freedberg opined that on their album The Strikers, \"the band expands upon what could called 'street jazz' and proves ... that it knows exactly what taboos it is taming, what comparisons its songs make between the curses of the past and the realities of Manhattan.\"\nMembers included Darryl Gibbs, Howie Young, Milton Brown (later of Warp 9), Robert Rodriguez, Ruben Faison, Robert Gilliom, and Willie Slaughter.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio album ===\nThe Strikers (Prelude, 1981)\n\n\n=== Compilation album ===\n12\" Mixes (Unidisc, 1991)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Strikers discography at Discogs"

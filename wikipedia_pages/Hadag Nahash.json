    "text": "Hadag Nahash (Hebrew: הדג נחש ha-Dag Nachash, [(h)aˈdaɡ naˈχaʃ]) is an Israeli hip hop and funk band, founded in 1996 in Jerusalem, which makes leftist political statements in many of its protest songs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHadag Nahash has been a major contributor to the Israeli hip-hop scene, and is presently one of Israel's most successful bands, with eight studio albums released to date.\nThe band's songs call for peace, tolerance and equality, and include political and social protest. Most songs are written by Sha'anan Streett, the band's lead vocalist. \"We demand the freedom to write whatever we want at any given time, and that can be about, for example, marijuana or just having a good time, as well as social injustice. It’s not one or the other. Our lives contain both. And when we want to keep it real, we have to speak about both.\"\nYossi Fine also produced the band's third studio album, \"Homer Mekomi\" (חומר מקומי, \"Local Material\"), which was released in 2004. The biggest hit out of the album was \"Shirat Hasticker\" (שירת הסטיקר, \"The Sticker Song\"), which was written by Israeli novelist David Grossman. T\nIn 2006, Hadag Nahash released their fourth studio album, \"Be'ezrat Hajam\" (בעזרת הג'אם, With Help of the Jam, a wordplay on the expression \"With God's Help\"), which was named Album of the Year at the Israel Music Awards. The album, recorded at In the Pocket studios in California, was the first album in which the vocals were divided equally between Sha'anan Streett and DJ Guy Mar. \"Be'ezrat Hajam\" contained the hit \"Hine Ani Ba\" (Hebrew: הנה אני בא, \"Here I Come\") written by Guy Mar about moving from his hometown Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. \"Hine Ani Ba\" is also an example of a song with a political or cultural message, as it depicts a cultural struggle between Jerusalem, a symbol of Israel's heritage, and Tel Aviv, a hub for young people and nightlife. \nIn December 2009, Hadag Nahash released the first single from its sixth album (fifth studio album), 6: a protest song against the rising internal violence in Israeli society, called \"Od Ach Ehad\" (עוד אח אחד, \"One More Brother\"). \nTheir second-most recent song, Bomba, was released as a single on 3 August 2020 and was produced by Johnny Goldstein. The lyrics reference ongoing protests against the thirty-fifth government of Israel, calling to \"break the cycle of Miri, Bibi, Miki, Bibi, Benny, Bibi\" and asking for the release of Avera Mengistu.\n\n\n== Group members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nSha'anan Streett (שאנן סטריט) - Rapping, Vocals (1996–present)\nYair \"Yaya\" Cohen-Harounoff (יאיר \"יאיא\" כהן־אהרונוב) - Bass guitar, Backing vocals (1996–present)\nDavid \"Dudush\" Klemes (דוד \"דודוש\" קלמס) - Keyboard (1996–present)\nMoshe \"Atraf\" Asaraf (משה \"אטרף\" אסרף) - Drums (1996–present)\nGuy \"DJ Guy Mar\" Margalit (מרגלית \"DJ גיא \"גיא מר) - Rapping, Vocals, Turntables, Sampling (1998-present)\nShlomi Alon (שלומי אלון) - Saxophone, Flute, EWI, Rapping, Vocals (2001-present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nShahar Mintz ((שחר מינץ- Guitar (1996-1998)\nYaron Mohar (ירון מוהר)- Saxophone (1996-2001)\nMeir Shalivo (מאיר שליבו)- Trumpet (1996-2000)\nAmir Ben Ami (אמיר בן־עמי)- Guitar (1998-2007)\nRafi Malkiel (רפי מלכיאל)- Trombone (2000-2003)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial site"

    "text": "Attacco Decente were a musical group from Brighton, England, active from 1984 to 1996.\nThe band was notable for using unusual acoustic instruments such as hammered dulcimers, Appalachian dulcimers, and tongue drums alongside more conventional instruments such as acoustic guitar and acoustic bass guitar.  Their founder member and sole constant was Geoff Smith.  Their lyrics, written by Smith, reflected a strong socialist political stance, especially on the early singles and the first album.  Although the band were active at the height of Thatcherism, they did not participate in the more moderate Red Wedge collective.\nThe band's first single, \"Trojan Horse\", featured Smith and Graham Barlow.  Acoustic guitarist and backing vocalist Mark Allen joined and they released a 12\" EP, \"U.K.A. (United Kingdom of America)\", the sleeve of which featured an endorsement from Billy Bragg.\nThe band released their debut album, The Baby Within Us Marches On, in 1988. Barlow left after the release of the \"I Don't Care How Long It Takes\" single. Smith and Allen recorded the band's second and last album, Crystal Night, as a duo.  The band's sound changed somewhat in this incarnation, with the heavily percussive sound of the trio line-up replaced by a mellower, folky feel.  There was less emphasis on the tongue drums and more on the hammered dulcimer and Allen's guitar, which took on a markedly flamenco aspect.  Smith's lyrics became less overtly political, and more concerned with love and personal relationships.\nThe band split after the Crystal Night album.  Smith continued as a solo performer and composer, creating music for film and dance.  Allen is now a teacher, but has also continued to work as a singer and guitarist in a number of groups.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n\"Trojan Horse\"/\"Storms Clear the Air\" (Timber, 1984)\n\"U.K.A.

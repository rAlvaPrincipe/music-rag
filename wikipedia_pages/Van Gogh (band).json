During the 1990s, the band released a number of well-received albums inspired mostly by the works of the band Ekatarina Velika, and in the 2000s the band adopted more commercial sound, becoming one of the top acts of the Serbian rock scene. Since the beginning of the band's career, vocalist and guitarist Zvonimir Đukić and drummer Srboljub Radivojević have been the mainstay members of the band.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nThe band was formed in 1986.

In February 1986, the band released their debut single \"Tragovi prošlosti\" (\"Traces of the Past\"), and in May they appeared at Youth Festival in Subotica, performing songs \"Tragovi prošlosti\", \"Tvoj smeh\" (\"Your Laughter\") and \"Menjam se\" (\"I'm Changing\"), and winning the second place by the choice of the audience, and the third place by the choice of the jury. At the end of 1986 the band released their debut self-titled album. The album lyrics were written by Milisavjević, the music was written by Đukić, and the album was produced by Petrović. The album featured new versions of \"Tragovi prošlosti\", \"Tvoj smeh\" and \"Menjam se\". After a number of concerts Van Gogh disbanded.

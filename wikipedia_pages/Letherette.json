    "text": "Letherette is an electronic music production duo, consisting of Richard Roberts and Andrew Harber. They released their debut album Letherette through their current label Ninja Tune in 2013, and have previously released material on Ho Tep Records.\n\n\n== History ==\nFriends from childhood, they grew up together in Wolverhampton, UK, where they are still based. The name of the act was originally the name of an old track by Andy, which the pair thought suited their music. They first came to note when they remixed Bibio's 'Lover's Carvings' for his album The Apple and the Tooth, released on Warp in 2009. Subsequently, they released two EPs on Eglo Records subsidiary Ho Tep.\nThe pair provided a mixtape for BTS radio in 2010 which showcased some of their influences alongside a number of their own tracks. It became one of the most talked about and downloaded guest mixes of BTS radio that year. In 2012, they contributed a remix to the vinyl version of Bonobo's Black Sands Remixed album, and in the same year were signed by Ninja Tune Records. Their music has been played on BBC Radio 1 by Benji B and BBC Radio 6 Music by Lauren Laverne and Tom Ravenscroft.\n\n\n== Style ==\nLetherette's musical style often draws comparisons to Hip Hop artists (such as Madlib, J Dilla and MF Doom) and French House acts (like Daft Punk, Alan Braxe and Breakbot). Their musical production involves heavy use of sampling but also incorporates live instrumentation ranging from \"guitars to synthesisers and various percussion instruments\". In an interview with DJ Magazine they talk extensively about their use of sampling, including the comment \"we've always loved the idea that you can take the naffest track imaginable [and] sample certain parts to transform it into something you think is amazing. It's like you uncover a secret, in a way. The track was always there within the details of the record, and you unlock it with sampling.\". The pairs music is often described as playful and fun, with Souncrash stating \"Fun is what sets Letherette apart\", and Dazed & Confused saying that they \"bound between sounds characteristic of Warp and Roule but do so with a metaphorical pi√±a colada in their hands\".\n\n\n== Live ==\nDescribing their live-set in an Interview with The Independent they said \"We use laptops with a couple of midi-controllers and a mixer. We just play, remix and rework tracks live. We take existing tracks and break them all down to their separate parts, then just semi improvise ways to play them with added effects and whatever else we decide to use on the night.\".\nThey have supported Clark and Bibio, and performed with Bonobo, Gold Panda, Nosaj Thing, Illum Sphere and FaltyDL. As of 2013 they have being collaborating with Clayton Welham to create an immersive visual show.\nFestival appearances have included MUTEK Montreal, the Bonobo Roundhouse Festival and Soundwave Croatia. They have also made two Boiler Room appearances.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Album ===\n\n\n==== Letherette ====\nThe pair released its debut full-length album on Ninja Tune on 15 April 2013.

    "text": "Rank and File was an American country rock band established in 1981 in Austin, Texas by brothers Chip Kinman and Tony Kinman, who had been members of the seminal California punk rock band The Dils. The band were forerunners in combining the musical rawness and Do It Yourself punk aesthetic with the style and ambience of country and western music, helping to create a subgenre known as cowpunk. After releasing three albums, the band terminated in 1987.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nIn 1981, the brothers Chip and Tony Kinman split up their influential political punk band The Dils, based in Carlsbad, California, and departed for the East. After a brief time in New York City, the brothers landed in the musical mecca of Austin, Texas, to start a new band. There they joined forces with guitarist Alejandro Escovedo of The Nuns to form Rank and File. Chip Kinman also played guitar while Tony was on bass. The drummer was Slim Evans.\nChip Kinman later recalled the difficulty the band had at the time of its launch, during which \"people were grossed out\" by the band's heavy-on-the-country, light-on the punk sound. \"We'd go into New Wave clubs, and no one was playing country music. We'd play those songs, and we'd never get asked back,\" Kinman remembered.\n\n\n=== Recording history ===\nRank and File released three albums—two on prominent Los Angeles label Slash Records and a third on the offbeat, retro-oriented Rhino Records.\nThe band's debut album, Sundown, was released in June 1982 on Slash Records.\nTheir second album, 1984's Long Gone Dead, included a cover version of a tune by Lefty Frizzell, and made use of traditional country instrumentation such as a steel guitar and fiddle. Chicago Tribune music critic Tom Popson emphasized the band's employment of \"a lot of Johnny Cash-style rockabilly guitar lines\" as part of that particular project. Jeff Ross was the other guitarist on this album. He had replaced Junior Brown, who appeared on stage with Rank and File but did not feature on any recordings.\nThe band's third and final release, Rank and File on Rhino Records, introduced Bobby Kahr on drums, replacing Evans. Released in 1987, it marked a move from traditional country to more pop-oriented country-tinged fare, which the band deemed \"a little easier for the normal person to pick up on\".\nIn 2006, Tony Kinman discussed how the delay in recording the third album damaged Rank and File's career and caused them to lose their desire. \"That’s basically why that third album sounds like it does, heavy metal and hard rock or something,\" he said. \"It’s just wrong.\" The band broke up soon afterward.\n\n\n=== Stylistic trendsetters ===\nWhile continuing to espouse their personal political views, the Kinmans saw their new band as a more entertaining departure from the intensity of hardcore punk, embracing the sound and cultural ambience of country music, albeit with a post-punk spin. In a 1986 interview with Flipside magazine, bassist Tony Kinman emphasized the band's willingness to shatter stylistic preconceptions to become trendsetters:\n\nThe band appeared on PBS's nationally broadcast country showcase Austin City Limits.\n\n\n=== Later projects ===\nThe Kinmans' next project was the synthpop, guitar and drum-machine based, Blackbird. They would return to the cowpunk subgenre with another band, a minimalistic three-piece band called Cowboy Nation that released its debut album in January 1997 on Shock Records from Australia.\nIn 2018, The Kinman brothers reunited for Chip's new band Ford Madox Ford. Released by Porterhouse Records, Ford Madox Ford's debut album, This American Blues, featured Chip on vocals and guitar, Matt Littell on bass, S. Scott Aguero on drums, Dewey Peak on lead guitar and Tony Kinman as producer.\nAlejandro Escovedo formed the True Believers with his brother Javier, before launching a solo songwriting and recording career.\nTony Kinman died on May 4, 2018.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSundown, Slash Records, 1982\nLong Gone Dead, Slash Records, 1984\nRank and File, Rhino Records, 1987\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlan Thicke, \"Rank and File: Interview\", Thicke of the Night, 1983. —Video."

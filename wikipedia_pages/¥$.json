    "text": "¥$ is an American hip hop superduo composed of rapper Kanye West and singer Ty Dolla Sign. With the two maintaining a strong relationship during 2023, West invited Ty Dolla Sign to record songs in Tokyo, Italy, and later Saudi Arabia. During the recording sessions for West's eleventh studio album, the duo began work on their collaborative effort, Vultures 1 (2024).  \nDespite mixed critical response, Vultures 1 was met with commercial success, debuting atop the Billboard 200 and spawning the single \"Carnival\" (with Rich the Kid featuring Playboi Carti), which peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100. After several delays, the duo's second album, Vultures 2 (2024), was released in August of that year; it was met with weaker sales—peaking at number two on the Billboard 200—and negative reception from critics, who cited the album as exceedingly unfinished. They won Best Group at the 2024 BET Awards.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nAmerican rapper Ye and singer Ty Dolla Sign began collaborating in September 2014 during the production of Ye's seventh studio album, The Life of Pablo. Ty Dolla Sign co-wrote and provided vocals on two of its singles, \"Real Friends\" and \"Fade\". Following its release, the two were reported to have begun working on a collaborative project slated for release that same year, although this never came to fruition.\nTy Dolla Sign also provided uncredited vocals on Ye's eighth studio album ye (2018), on the tracks \"All Mine\", \"Wouldn't Leave\" and \"Violent Crimes\". That same year, the duo had recorded several songs intended for West's ninth studio album, known at the time as Yandhi, which was delayed indefinitely and ultimately scrapped. Ty Dolla Sign contributed to its unreleased tracks \"New Body\" and \"Sky City\", the latter of which was later included on Vultures 2. The following year, the album was reannounced as Jesus Is King, which, despite excluding the latter two songs from Yandhi, included a guest appearance from Ty Dolla Sign on \"Everything We Need\".\n\n\n=== Formation and Vultures 1 ===\nIn October 2023, Ty Dolla Sign confirmed the existence of the duo and their upcoming album via an Instagram post displaying the name ¥$. During a performance in November 2023, he revealed that he had been working with West on the album in Saudi Arabia and that it would be \"coming real soon\". Videos of the artists recording with rapper Lil Baby also surfaced online.\nWest and Ty Dolla Sign spent three months recording Vultures 1 in Saudi Arabia, mostly in the city of al-Ula, according to collaborator DJ Camper. British singer ZLYAH, who West inspired, contributed to the writing of the track \"Carnival\". Record producer Fred Again played snippets of a song by the duo at a club, rumored to be from the album.\nThe album's first public listening event was announced for February 8, 2024, at Chicago's United Center. Vultures 1 was released independently through West's YZY brand on February 10, 2024, commemorating the 20th anniversary of his debut album The College Dropout. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200.\n\n\n=== Vultures trilogy ===\nOn January 23, 2024, West revealed that the Vultures project would be released as a trilogy, with the first installment, Vultures 1, scheduled for release on February 9, 2024. The second volume, Vultures 2, was set to release on March 8, with the final part, Vultures 3 on April 5, 2024. Vultures 1 was released independently through West's YZY brand on February 10, 2024. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, becoming West's 11th consecutive number-one album and Ty Dolla Sign's first. It also reached the top spot in several other countries.\nVultures 2 was released on August 3, 2024. Producer Timbaland and rapper French Montana announced their involvement in the project. West stated that Vultures 2 will be sold exclusively on his Yeezy website for $20 instead of being released on streaming platforms like its predecessor. After several delays and uncertainty surrounding the release of Vultures 2, West confirmed the album's official release date. During an interview on Justin LaBoy's The Download podcast, which aired on April 22, 2024, West revealed that Vultures 2 will be released on May 3. This announcement aligned with the date West had previously leaked to a Baby Keem fan page in March when he mistakenly thought the account was the rapper's actual profile. Tracks such as \"River\" featuring Young Thug, the Backstreet Boys-sampling \"Everybody\" featuring Charlie Wilson, who also appears in \"Matthew\" along with West's daughter North, \"Promotion\" featuring Future, \"Slide\", and \"Field Trip\" with Playboi Carti, Kodak Black, Lil Durk, and Don Toliver were all teased. \"Slide\" was released as the lead single on August 2, 2024. Just a day later, on August 3, Vultures 2 was released through West's YZY brand independently.\n\n\n==== Controversy ====\nThe original artwork for Vultures 1, revealed by West in January 2024, was believed to be inspired by the cover art for Filosofem—an album by black metal artist Burzum (handled and maintained by murderer and neo-Nazi musician Varg Vikernes) as well as painter Caspar David Friedrich, with the album title's font resembling Burzum's typeface. West was also photographed in 2024 wearing a Burzum shirt while standing beside JPEGMafia. Vultures 1 was released with a new cover art featuring a photograph of West completely obscured by all-black clothing, including an opaque head covering, standing next to his partner, Bianca Censori, with her back turned, wearing stockings and a sheer black cloth around her waist. With the announcement of Vultures 2, the duo revealed the cover for the album featuring Ty Dolla Sign wearing a leather jacket and a mask, standing in the center of a brown background while holding a picture of his brother \"Big TC\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n=== Appearances together ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

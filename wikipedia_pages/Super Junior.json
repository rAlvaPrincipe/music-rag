    "text": "Super Junior  (Korean: 슈퍼주니어; RR: Syupeo Junieo; stylized in all caps), also known as SJ or SuJu, is a South Korean boy band. The group is composed of Leeteuk, Heechul, Yesung, Shindong, Sungmin, Eunhyuk, Siwon, Donghae, Ryeowook, and Kyuhyun. Han Geng, Kibum, and Kangin were originally part of the group before departing in 2011, 2015 and 2019, respectively. The group was formed by the founder of SM Entertainment, Lee Soo-man in 2005 as a 12-piece group with rotational members but the concept was abandoned after addition of Kyuhyun in 2006. They are also dubbed by the media as the \"King of Hallyu Wave\" due to their contributions in Korean Wave.\nSuper Junior launched into international recognition following the release of their best-selling single \"Sorry, Sorry\" in 2009, the title song of their most critically successful album, Sorry, Sorry. Over the years, they have been divided into smaller groups, simultaneously targeting different music industries and audiences. The members have also individually branched out into hosting, presenting and acting. Their successes and popularity as all-rounded entertainers have led other Korean entertainment managements to also begin training their music groups in other aspects of the entertainment industry.\nSuper Junior was the best-selling K-pop artist for four years in a row. The group has earned thirteen music awards from the Mnet Asian Music Awards, nineteen from the Golden Disc Awards, and are the second singing group to win Favorite Artist Korea at the 2008 MTV Asia Awards after jtL in 2003. In 2012, they were nominated for \"Best Asian Act\" in MTV Europe Music Awards. They won the \"International Artist\" and \"Best Fandom\" awards at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards. In March 2020, Super Junior broke their own record topping the Korean Album Chart of Taiwan's KKBOX for 122 consecutive weeks since 2017 with their 8th album Play, the 8th album repackage REPLAY in 2018, the 9th album Time_Slip from 2019, and  9th album repackage Timeless.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\n\n\n=== 2000–2005: Formation and debut ===\nIn 2000, SM Entertainment held their first overseas casting auditions in Beijing 101, China and recruited Han Geng, who was selected among three thousand applicants. That same year, Leeteuk, Yesung, and Eunhyuk were recruited after auditioning for the company's annual casting system in Seoul. Sungmin and Donghae became trainees after jointly winning first place in an SM-sponsored contest in 2001. In 2002, Heechul and Kangin were recruited along with Kibum, who was discovered in Los Angeles, California by a casting agent. Siwon became a trainee after being scouted in 2003. Shindong became a trainee in 2004. Ryeowook won the 2004 Chin Chin Youth Festival singing competition and became a trainee just two months before debut in 2005. Kyuhyun then joined the group in 2006, after winning third place in the 2005 Chin Chin Youth Festival.\nIn early 2005, Lee Soo-man announced that he had been preparing for an all-boy project group of twelve members to debut at the end of the year. He called this singing group to be \"The Gateway to Stardom of Asia,\" as most of the members in this group were chosen for their experiences as actors, MCs, models, and radio hosts prior to debut. Heechul and Kibum were already established actors at the time, and most of the other members had already made various kinds of appearances in television and media. Inspired by the rotational concept of Japan's girl group Morning Musume, Lee said that his new group would also experience line-up changes, with new members replacing selected members every year to keep the group constantly young and all-rounded. This concept was then newly introduced to the K-pop market. They are also modelled after Japanese boy band SMAP who are also active as actors and entertainers besides being singers.\nFor a while the group was rumoured to be called O.V.E.R, the acronym for \"Obey the Voice for Each Rhythm.\"[a] However, before the group settled with their current name, the company simply referred to them as juniors, a representation of the members' young ages when they first became SM trainees. After the members showcased their different talents to the company at a picnic, the company finalized their group name to Super Junior, and the first generation of Super Junior officially became Super Junior 05. Super Junior 05 made their pre-debut performance on the Korean channel Mnet on September 11, 2005.[b] At the showcase, they performed various styles of hip-hop dancing, where they danced to B2K's \"Take It to the Floor\". Han Geng, Eunhyuk, and Donghae also performed a separate dance together, dancing to Usher's \"Caught Up.\" However, the performance did not air on television until May 16, 2006, as a segment in the Super Junior Show, the group's first television documentary.\nThe group officially debuted on SBS' music program Popular Song on November 6, 2005, performing their first single \"Twins (Knock Out)\". A digital single with \"Twins (Knock Out)\", \"You Are the One\", and three additional tracks were released online on November 8, followed by the release of their debut album Twins on December 6, 2005. The album sold 28,536 copies in the first month of release and debuted at number three in the monthly chart of December 2005.[c]\n\n\n=== 2006–2007: U, Don't Don, and commercial success ===\nIn February 2006, Super Junior 05 began performances for \"Miracle\", the second promotional single from their debut album. \"Miracle\" topped the music charts of Thailand, drawing interest from international markets. They were subsequently invited to perform at the Pattaya Music Festival in Thailand in March 2006, making it their first overseas gig. As promotions for \"Miracle\" ended, SM Entertainment began selecting new members for Super Junior's second generation, Super Junior 06. The company even prepared a list of chosen members that were to graduate from the group. However, the company abandoned the rotational concept after adding a thirteenth member, Kyuhyun, in 2006. The group then became known as just Super Junior, without the suffix \"05\".\nAfter the addition of Kyuhyun, Super Junior released their single \"U\" for free download on May 25, 2006, on their official website. \"U\" exceeded 400,000 downloads within five hours of release and ultimately surpassed 1.7 million downloads, crashing the server. The physical single of \"U\" with a total of three tracks was released on June 6, eventually selling over 81,000 units in South Korea. The single became one of Korea's most popular songs of the year, taking up number one spots for five consecutive weeks on two of Korea's top music programs. By the end of the year, Super Junior collected over seven awards in five of South Korea's top music award ceremonies, and was one of the three Best Newcomer winners at the 21st Golden Disk Awards.\nIn late 2006, Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, and Yesung formed the subgroup Super Junior-K.R.Y., Super Junior's first sub-unit. They performed their first single \"The One I Love\", theme song to the Korean television drama Hyena, on the KBS music program Music Bank on November 5, 2006. In February 2007, Leeteuk, Heechul, Kangin, Sungmin, Shindong and Eunhyuk formed Super Junior-T, a trot-singing group. They released their first single \"Rokkugo\" on February 23, 2007, and made a debut performance on Popular Songs two days later.\nSuper Junior's second official album was intended for a late 2006 release, but due to several accidental setbacks, Don't Don was not released until September 20, 2007. Don't Don sold over 60,000 units the first day of release and debuted at number one on the monthly chart of September 2007. Although Don't Don received mixed reviews from critics, the album went to sell more than 160,000 copies by the end of the year, becoming the second best-selling record of 2007.[c] Super Junior received seven nominations at the 2007 Mnet/KM Music Festival, winning three of them which included Artist of the Year, termed by many as the highest recognition of the ceremony. Super Junior collected two more recognitions at the 22nd Golden Disk Awards, including a Disk Bonsang award (Record of the Year).\n\n\n=== 2008–2009: Sorry, Sorry and career breakthrough ===\n\nSuper Junior-M, Super Junior's Mandopop subgroup comprising members Han Geng, Siwon, Donghae, Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, and Super Junior-M members Henry and Zhou Mi, was formed in April 2008. Although the creation of the subgroup initially created a strife between the group's fans and their management,[d] Super Junior-M went on to become Super Junior's most successful subgroup, selling out two concerts in Hong Kong, topping weekly ratings with their appearance on Chinese variety programs, and was the idol group with the most endorsement contracts in China. They won numerous awards at Chinese music festivals, and achieved critical acclaim after the release of their single \"Super Girl\" from their second record Super Girl, which garnered them a nomination for Best Vocal Group at the 21st Golden Melody Awards. A fourth Super Junior subgroup was created soon after Super Junior-M's debut. With five members from Super Junior-T and Yesung, they formed the subgroup Super Junior-H, releasing their first extended play (EP) Cooking? Cooking! on June 5, 2008. In November 2008, Super Junior-T made a debut in Japan, collaborating with Japanese comedy duo Moeyan. Their single \"ROCK&GO\", the Japanese – language version of \"Rokuko\", debuted at number 19 on the Oricon Daily Charts and ascended to number 2 three days later.\nSuper Junior's first Asia-wide concert tour, Super Show, started on February 22, 2008, in Seoul.[e] The group held a successful two-day fan meeting in Japan at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, selling out 12,000 tickets in several days. The group released a compiled single \"U/Twins\", which includes the Japanese version of \"U\" in the limited release version, to complement the event. The single peaked at number four on Japan's Oricon Daily Chart on its first day of release, and dropped down four places on its second. The single broke a new record for being the first Korean single to have made within top 10 on Japan's Oricon Weekly Chart.\nThe group released their third studio album Sorry, Sorry on March 12, 2009. It was their first album to debut at number one on the Hanteo Charts, selling over 29,000 copies the first day. After only a month of release, the album became South Korea's best-selling album of 2009, and ultimately sold over 250,000 copies in South Korea. It became the best-selling K-pop album in Taiwan, Thailand, China, and the Philippines, in which the latter credited the album to be the first K-pop album to reach number one in music charts from the country. The album's title single \"Sorry, Sorry\" became an instant hit, collecting a total of ten number-one awards for ten consecutive weeks in Korea, and stayed as number one for a record-breaking 37 weeks in Taiwan's K-pop singles chart. \"Sorry, Sorry\" achieved national and international success, and has since been the group's best-selling single in South Korea. Sorry, Sorry won several accolades at the 24th Golden Disk Awards, including the Disk Daesang (Record of the Year).\nAfter the success of Sorry, Sorry, Super Junior commenced their second Asia-wide concert tour Super Show 2, on July 17, 2009, in Seoul.\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: Bonamana, lineup changes, and international recognition ===\nDespite their critical and commercial success, the group was plagued by legal turmoils and lineup changes during their concert tour. Though Kibum was shown in the ads and promotional videos for Super Show 2, he did not officially participate in the concert tour, and he announced his temporary leave from the group to pursue his acting career. In October 2009, Kangin was charged with a DUI and hit-and-run after crashing into a parked taxi holding three passengers. In December 2009, Han Geng filed for contract termination from SM Entertainment, claiming that the provisions of his contract were unlawful, harsh, and against his rights. He parted with the group and released his solo album Geng Xin in July 2010, which sold over 510,000 copies. That same month, Kangin announced his hiatus to fulfill his two-year mandatory military service.\nWith only ten members left, Super Junior went off to release their fourth studio album, Bonamana in May 2010.

With the exception of Kibum, all of the members have been part of at least one subgroup. The subgroups were part of SM Entertainment's strategy to not limit Super Junior's activities while certain members focused on their individual careers. This allowed the group members greater freedom to focus on different elements of their careers, and gave the group opportunities to explore different musical styles and showcase different skills. The goal of the subgroup formations was also to show that Super Junior could accommodate and perform different musical genres. This strategy was later challenged by critics, as it has influenced an overwhelming number of music groups to create official and unofficial subgroups alike.\nIn September 2023, their fifth sub-unit Super Junior-D&E became the only sub-unit had managed by different label from Super Junior following the unit member Donghae and Eunhyuk not renewed their individual contract with SM and decided the sub-unit's future activities along with them.\n\nSubgroups\nSuper Junior-K.R.Y. – Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, Yesung\nSuper Junior-T – Leeteuk, Heechul, Shindong, Sungmin, Eunhyuk\nSuper Junior-M – Sungmin,  Eunhyuk, Siwon, Zhou Mi, Donghae, Ryeowook, Kyuhyun\nSuper Junior-H – Leeteuk, Yesung, Shindong, Sungmin, Eunhyuk\nSuper Junior-D&E – Donghae, Eunhyuk\nSuper Junior-L.S.S. – Leeteuk, Shindong, Siwon\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Musical style ===\nSuper Junior's musical style has varied from album to album: they pursued bubblegum pop in Twins; alternative rock in Don't Don; pop and contemporary R&B in Sorry, Sorry and Bonamana; electropop and synthpop in Mr. Simple; Eurohouse in Sexy, Free & Single; neo soul and jazz-pop in Mamacita; Latin pop in repackage album of Play – Replay and One More Time; and hip-hop in their latest repackage album of Time Slip – Timeless. The group has also covered few songs in their albums. Their debut single \"Twins (Knock Out)\" is a cover of Triple Eight's \"Knockout,\" which was released in 2003. In most of their covers, the original titles are kept, such as Cape's \"L.O.V.E\" and Exile's \"Believe\", both tracks from Twins. Super Junior works closely with Yoo Young-jin, who has produced and arranged most of the group's title singles since their debut. Yoo is also known for creating the renowned SMP style, a genre that includes a balanced infusion of rock, R&B, and rap, empowered by the sounds of electric guitar, bass, and other different percussion instruments. Super Junior prominently featured this SMP style in Don't Don. The group are also acclaimed for their vocal harmonization and unison as each member contributes a different range in their choruses, and often incorporate different types of vocal belting into their songs.[f]\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nSuper Junior were ambassadors to many bodies. They were selected to become the ambassador of Ansan city in 2007, \nand Gangnam District in 2012. They were also appointed as the goodwill ambassadors for the 2008 Korea and Thailand 50th Anniversary, honoring the good relationship between the two countries.

On June 17, 2011, Super Junior were chosen to be the ambassadors of Seoul Summer Sale 2011. They have also been appointed to the same position for Seoul Summer Sale 2012, and 2016.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Expansion to China ===\nFollowing the subgroups Super Junior-K.R.Y. and Super Junior-T, on October 2, 2007, SM Entertainment announced the birth of another Super Junior sub-unit project that would begin activities in China starting 2008. Zhou Mi and SM Entertainment's new Taiwanese-Canadian trainee Henry Lau, who was also featured in the music video of \"Don't Don\", were also members of the subgroup. The announcement brought in a huge wave of dissatisfaction and opposition from some fans of Super Junior after the announcement of two new members. Thousands of fans from Super Junior's official fanclub E.L.F. silently sat in front of the SM building and held signs that supported the group having thirteen members. After more rumors regarding adding another member to the subgroup, the fans decided to gain a legal representation as part of SM Entertainment's stockholders. As of March 20, 2008, Super Junior fans purchased 58,206 shares of SM Entertainment, holding 0.3% of the company's entire stock. The fans released a statement that they will take every opportunity to prevent SM Entertainment from adding new members and to keep Super Junior as only thirteen.\n\n\n=== Conflict with MBC ===\nA time-slot dispute occurred between SM Entertainment and MBC when SM insisted to have Kangin stay on SBS' Explorers of the Human Body instead of MBC's Sunday Night Dong-An Club (동안클럽) where Kangin has been a regular host. MBC temporarily banned the rest of Super Junior from appearing in any future performances and shows hosted by MBC. Kangin also lost his MC jobs to T.O.P. of Big Bang for the music show, Show! Music Core and also two more variety shows, which both soon canceled after Kangin left due to low ratings. MBC demanded an apology from SM Entertainment in order for Super Junior to appear on shows hosted by the channel again. However, MBC concluded that Super Junior's ban was never official, but just a decision for shows' producers to decide.\n\n\n=== Han Geng's lawsuit and departure from group ===\nOn December 21, 2009, Han Geng filed for contract termination with S.M. Entertainment, unhappy with contract length and salary. On December 21, 2010, the Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of Han Geng.

    "text": "One Way is an American R&B and funk band that was popular in the late 1970s, and throughout most of the 1980s, led by singer Al Hudson. The group's most successful record was \"Cutie Pie\", which reached number 4 on the Billboard Soul Singles chart and number 61 on the pop chart in 1982.\n\n\n== Al Hudson and the (Soul) Partners ==\nDetroit vocalist Al Hudson, guitarist Dave Roberson and bassist Kevin McCord (b. Kevin Duane McCord, 1954, Detroit, Michigan) founded Al Hudson and the Soul Partners in the mid '70s. Other members included keyboardists Jack Hall and Jonathan \"Corky\" Meadows, drummers Theodore Dudley and Gregory Greene, Gary Andrews and guitarist Cortez Harris.\nThey recorded several singles for Atco Records before joining ABC Records and made their debut with the LP Especially for You in 1977. They recorded their second album Cherish that same year and released their third album Spreading Love in 1978 from which the single Spread Love was released. Although not charting in the UK, it became a big hit in the clubs. By that time ABC Records was in the process of being bought by MCA Records and vocalist Alicia Myers joined the group. They released the album Happy Feet as Al Hudson and the Partners in 1979 which contains the R&B hit \"You Can Do It\" which was co-penned by Myers. The single also peaked at number 10 on Billboard’s Disco Action Top 80 Chart in June 1979, as well as a top 15 hit in the UK.\n\n\n== One Way ==\nWhen ABC merged with MCA Records, they subsequently changed their name to One Way featuring Al Hudson. Their next album was simply called One Way Featuring Al Hudson and was also released in 1979. The album included the long 12\" version of \"You Can Do It\". Their 1980 album was also confusingly called One Way featuring Al Hudson. By 1981, the band was simply called One Way.\nIn 1981, frontwoman Alicia Myers left the band to pursue a solo career. She was replaced by Candyce Edwards, who served as female lead of the group from 1981 until 1985. Edwards' debut was on the Fancy Dancer album and she remained with the group throughout their major success. After Edwards left the group in 1985, Jeanette Mack-Jackson replaced Edwards as lead singer.\nThey were on MCA’s roster until 1988. They scored five top 10 U.S. R&B chart hits, with the biggest being \"Cutie Pie\", which reached number four in 1982. One Way had R&B hit \"Mr. Groove\" ,about James Brown, in 1984.\nThey had two more minor hits on the UK Singles Chart with \"Music\" (1979) and \"Let's Talk\" (1985). They gained US R&B hits such as \"Don't Think about it\" and \"You Better Quit\" in 1987.\nThey moved to Capitol Records in 1988, where they released their final album, A New Beginning, later that same year. By this time, only Hudson, Roberson, and Meadows remained from the original line-up.\nIn 2019, after a 31-year hiatus, One Way featuring Al Hudson released their 12th album, New Old School.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n1993: Cutie Pie\n1995: Push\n1996: The Best of One Way: Featuring Al Hudson and Alicia Myers\n2005: 20th Century Masters: Millennium Collection\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== Al Hudson and the Soul Partners ====\n\n\n==== One Way ====\n\n\n== See also ==\nR.

    "text": "USBands, formally United States Scholastic Band Association and sometimes referred to as USSBA, was formed in the Fall 1988 to provide high school marching bands an opportunity to compete in a circuit featuring top judges from across the continent. US Bands is based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and the event is managed by BD Performing Arts.\nMembers of USBands include over 700 participating high school marching bands. Bands are offered over 150 festival opportunities and invitations annually to compete at major regional championships and at the U.S., Scholastic Band Championship.\nIn competitions, bands are classified by size and compete with bands within their classification. The classes include range from Group 1, the smallest, to Group 6, the largest. Bands are also classified by skill level. The skill classifications include the A Class for inexperienced bands, new bands, and bands that have recently moved to a larger size group and the Open class for established programs. In total, there are 12 classifications ranging from Group I A to Group VI Open, who perform and compete with bands of similar size and talent.\nUSBands has also begun supporting competitive indoor events, and provides cooperative fundraising opportunities. In the winter of 2012, USSBA changed their name to USBands.\n\n\n== Classifications ==\nUSBands allows their bands to classify themselves into three groups: \n\nPerformance Class: Ensembles who prefer a non-competitive experience at any USBands sanctioned event\nA Class: Ensembles who demonstrate a basic to intermediate skill set (may be building/rebuilding their program) and are adjudicated on a scale representing fundamental to intermediate skills.\nOpen Class: Seasoned ensembles that demonstrate expanded skill sets and are adjudicated on a scale supporting intermediate to advanced skills.\n\n\n== Group size ==\n\n\n=== 2016 to 2019 ===\nBetween 2016 and 2019, groups were classified by the following size, which includes playing members, auxiliary, and command personnel drum majors, and bands from Texas had group sizes that varied from the national ranges:\n\nGroup I - 1 to 38 members (Texas: 1-45)\nGroup II - 39 to 53 members (Texas: 46–80)\nGroup III - 54 to 70 members (Texas: 81–115)\nGroup IV - 71 to 95 members (Texas: 116–160)\nGroup V - 96 to 130 members (Texas: 161–200)\nGroup VI -131 and more members (Texas: 201+)\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\nFor 2020, USBands created an additional sizing and eliminated the \"Open Class\" as part of its \"v-USBands\" virtual adjudication platform.

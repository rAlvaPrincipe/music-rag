One of these early recordings, \"The Stone That The Builder Rejected\", was subsequently featured under the artist name \"Lanark\" on the Hot Chip entry of the \"DJ Kicks\" compilation series.\nDoyle and Martin were subsequently joined by Tom Hopkins, an electronic composer who began working as an engineer at Lanark Studios in 2009, as Hot Chip began work there recording part of their album One Life Stand.\nThe trio began writing and recording original compositions together around this time, collaborating with Pat Mahoney from the New York-based band LCD Soundsystem on the track \"Guitar Man\" and with Bolton-born producer and vocalist Planningtorock on several other tracks.\nIn September 2011, New Build released their first public track, a free download entitled \"Finding Reasons\". The trio subsequently established their own independent record label Lanark Recordings. Their first release was a vinyl only 12\" single featuring the tracks \"Misery Loves Company\", \"Guitar Man\" and a remix of \"Finding Reasons\" by Planningtorock. Their second release is another 12\" entitled \"Do You Not Feel Loved?\", made public in January 2012. It features remixes by the German DJ and techno producer Dominik Eulberg and the Amsterdam-based musicians Juju & Jordash.\nTheir first public appearance as a live band was in November 2011 at the Elektrowerkz venue in London. This was followed by shows at the Paradiso in Amsterdam and at the Eurosonic Festival in Groningen in January 2012.\nThe band undertook their first headline tour in March 2012 to mark the release of their first album Including sold-out shows in the UK, Europe and New York, plus a trip to the SXSW festival in Austin. In April 2013, armed with the one-off single \"False Thing\", the band headlined the Britweek Festival in Los Angeles and subsequently toured the West Coast of the USA. This Los Angeles showcase was gatecrashed by The Rolling Stones stealing the venue that was booked, as reported in the LA Times and other media.\n\n\n=== Pour It On ===\nIn August 2014, the band announced the intent to release their 2nd album internationally on Sunday Best Recordings, and revealed the new song \"The Sunlight\" with a video directed by friends Sam Lawlor and Lindsey Pollock, premiered on Pitchfork Media. The release date of the album was 20 October and was available for preorder with \"The Sunlight\" as an instant grat track.

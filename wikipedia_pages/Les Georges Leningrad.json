They frequently gave contradictory, incomprehensible or ludicrous answers to interviewers' questions. They have been elected twice \"freakiest local act\" by the readers of the weekly newspaper Montreal Mirror.\n\n\n== History ==\nLes Georges Leningrad formed in 1999 in Montreal. The members took turns at bass, keyboard, guitar, drums and vocals, sometimes using a drum machine. The band originally consisted of four members; they were reduced to a trio with the departure of bassist Toundra LaLouve after their first album was released. The band produced several albums, 2002's including Sur les Traces de Black Eskimo in 2004.\nIn 2007 the band created the score for Asparagus: A Horticultural Ballet, which was performed at Conway Hall in London, England.\nAfter announcing in early 2007 on their MySpace page that they had broken up, Les Georges Leningrad now say that they may play more shows sometime in the future.\n\n\n== Members ==\nPoney P (vocals)\nMingo L'Indien (keyboards, guitar)\nBobo Boutin (drums)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2002 Made In Taiwan\n2002 Deux Hot Dogs Moutarde Chou (Les Records Coco Cognac)\n2004 Sur les Traces de Black Eskimo (Alien8 Recordings)\n2005 Supa Doopa Remix (Troubleman Unlimited)\n2006 Sangue Puro (Dare to Care Records, Tomlab)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of bands from Canada\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLes Georges Leningrad at Exclaim!\nLes Georges Leningrad at allmusic\nAlien8 Recordings Archived 2011-02-08 at the Wayback Machine\nPUNKCAST#352 Live Video @ Mighty Robot, Brooklyn - Oct 25, 2003.

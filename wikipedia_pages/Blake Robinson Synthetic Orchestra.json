As music became a bigger interest in his life, he turned his focus to making a career of it, leaving the industry and becoming a freelance music software developer and composer. While he is no longer a full-time games developer, Robinson still spends his free time designing and developing independent video games.\n\n\n=== Composing ===\nRobinson is a keen user of Image-Line's FL Studio and is listed as a power-user on their website.

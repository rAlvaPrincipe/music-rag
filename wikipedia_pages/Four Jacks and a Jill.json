    "text": "Four Jacks and a Jill is a South African folk rock ensemble.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThey originally formed in 1964 without a \"Jill\" under the name \"The Nevadas\". Subsequently, they became the first group in South Africa to wear their hair long and they changed their name to \"The Zombies\" (different from the well-known British group). Later they added lead singer Glenys Lynne and changed the group's name to \"Four Jacks and A Jill\". The group included Clive Harding (bass guitar), Keith Andrews (rhythm guitar and organ), replaced by the late Mark Poulos (guitar and organ) during 1966–1967 and subsequently Till Hanneman who joined in 1967 (rhythm guitar, organ and trumpet), Bruce Bark (lead guitar, harmonica and saxophone), Tony Hughes (drums) and Glenys Lynne (lead vocal and organ). In South Africa, they had a hit song, \"Timothy\". In 1968 they cracked the American charts with the song \"Master Jack\", hitting the Billboard Hot 100 at no. 18 and reaching no. 3 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song also reached no. 10 on Cashbox and went to no. 1 in South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). The follow-up single, \"Mr. Nico\", peaked at no. 98 in the United States. That was their last hit in the U.S., but the group continued to score hits in their native country.\nThey have recorded and produced albums for a range of sing-along educational story books for various South African charities. \n\n\n== Members ==\nBass Guitar:\n\nClive Harding (1965 – 1983) *Original Member\nLead Vocals:\n\nGlenys Lynne Mynott/Harding - Lead Vocals (1965 – 1983) *Original Member\nDrums:\n\nTony Hughes/Rouse (1965 – 1982) *Original Member\nMossie Christopher Hills (1982 – 1983)\nGuitar:\n\nBruce Bark (1965 – 1969) *Original Member\nMarc Paulos (1966 – 1967)\nTill Hannemann (1967 – 1969)\nPierre van Riel (1969 – 1978)\nKeith Lansom (1969 – 1971)\nJosh Sklair (1973 – 1976)\nPaul De Villiers (1973)\nJohn Emmott (1976 – 1977)\nNigel Surtees (1977)\nPaul Nissen (1978 – 1980)\nJohn Ferrier (1980 – 1983)\nLen Dippenaar (1980 – 1983)\nTrumpet:\n\nKeith Andrews (1965 – 1966) *Original Member\nPiano:\n\nCedric Hornby (1971 – 1973)\nMike Nettmann (1973 – 1975)\nKeyboard:\n\nBrian Rubenstein (1975 – 1976)\nNeill Pienaar (1976 – 1980)\nGlynn Storm (1976)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Special Releases ===\n\n\n==== Gospel Albums ====\nA Time For Giving Volume 1 (Jill Music Publishers, 2004)\nA Time For Giving Volume 2 (Jill Music Publishers, 2004)\nA Time Of Faith Volume 1 (Jill Music Publishers)\nA Time Of Faith Volume 2 (Jill Music Publishers)\n\n\n==== Supporting Animal Anti-Cruelty League ====\nThe Adventures of Tony and Friends - Volume 1 (Jill Music Publishers, 2004)\nThe Adventures of Tony and Friends - Volume 2 (Jill Music Publishers, 2004)\nThe Adventures of Tony and Friends - Volume 3 (Jill Music Publishers, 2004)\nThe Adventures of Tony and Friends - Volume 4 (Jill Music Publishers, 2009)\nThe Adventures of Tony and Friends - Volume 5 (Jill Music Publishers, 2011)\n\n\n==== Supporting Institute for the Blind ====\nThe Adventures of Angel and Friends - Volume 1 (Jill Music Publishers, 2004)\nThe Adventures of Angel and Friends - Volume 2 (Jill Music Publishers, 2006)\n\n\n==== Supporting National St Giles Association ====\nThe Adventures of Peter and Friends - Volume 1 (Jill Music Publishers, 2004)\nThe Adventures of Peter and Friends - Volume 2 (Jill Music Publishers, 2009)\n\n\n==== Supporting National Council for Persons with Disabilities ====\nOn Tour with The New Jeans - Volume 1 (2011)\nOn Tour with The New Jeans - Volume 2 (2012)\n\n\n==== Instrumental Albums ====\nAn African Tapestry (2007)\nMusic to Drive By (2008)\nOrnaments of the Sky (2008)\nEscape to Africa (2009)\nBirds in Song (2010)\nAn African Farm (2011)\nAn African Safari (2011)\nSeasons (2013)\nOceans (2013)\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the mockumentary film This is Spinal Tap, the character Lt.

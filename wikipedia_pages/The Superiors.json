    "text": "The Superiors are a father-son record production and songwriting duo from Wyandanch, New York, consisting of Sidney \"S.I.D.\" Reynolds and Javon \"Von\" Reynolds. The duo has produced for notable hip-hop artists, such as Rod Wave, Lil Durk, and Polo G, with the single \"Wishing for a Hero\" being certified Gold by the RIAA.\n\n\n== History ==\nSidney grew up in Wyandanch, New York where he met Rakim and got him influenced unto the music business. In the early '90s, he was already famous for remixing, writing, and producing on albums for Freddie Foxxx, Slick Rick, Color Me Badd, Nikki D, Zhane, and Queen Latifah. Ever since his son (Javon) was five years old, he taught him how to play the guitar, piano, drums, and Logic Pro, so music was all he knew growing up.\n\n\n== Production discography ==\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\nLloyd Banks - V.6: The Gift\n\n03. \"The Sprint\"\nTrav - PUSH\n\n\"Presidential\" (featuring Jim Jones and Lloyd Banks)\n\n\n=== 2013 ===\nHustle Gang - Hustle Gang Presents: G.D.O.D.

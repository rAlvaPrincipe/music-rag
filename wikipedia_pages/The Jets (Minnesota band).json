    "text": "The Jets are a Tongan American family music group from Robbinsdale, a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Jets are composed of brothers and sisters LeRoy, Eddie, Eugene, Haini, Rudy, Kathi, Elizabeth, and Moana Wolfgramm, who perform pop, R&B, and dance music. They started performing as a family band in 1977. The group enjoyed worldwide success in 1985–1990, performing three world tours, and producing five top-10 hits on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe original band consisted of the eight oldest children of Maikeli \"Mike\" and Vaké Wolfgramm, who were originally from Tonga. The family has 17 children: 15 by birth, and two, Eddie and Eugene, by adoption. The children attended Robbinsdale Cooper High School. The family are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nThe band initially called themselves Quasar after a now-defunct brand of television sets. They changed their name to the Jets, a name taken from the Elton John song \"Bennie and the Jets\", on the suggestion of manager Don Powell.\nMember Eugene Wolfgramm died on April 15, 2024, at the age of 57.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe original members of the Jets had a number of Billboard Hot 100 hits, five of which reached the top ten, including the 1986 single \"Crush on You\", which peaked at No. 3 in July 1986 (No. 5 UK, No. 4 US R&B, No. 4 US Dance). They are also known for the singles \"You Got It All\", \"Cross My Broken Heart\", \"Rocket 2 U\", and \"Make It Real\". \"Sendin' All My Love\", which peaked at No. 88 on the Hot 100, reached No. 1 on the Billboard dance chart. \"You Got It All\" and \"Make It Real\", both ballads featuring lead vocals by Elizabeth Wolfgramm, were No. 1 hits on the Billboard adult contemporary chart. The band was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1988 for the song \"Rocket 2 U\" that featured lead vocals by Haini Wolfgramm. The Jets also performed the theme song for Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers in 1989.\nThe group performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the seventh game of the 1987 World Series, held in Minneapolis, and at Game 3 of the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals in suburban Bloomington.

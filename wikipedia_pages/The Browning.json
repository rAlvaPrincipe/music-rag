In late 2011, Brian Cravey was replaced with Collin Woroniak, and they released their video for \"Bloodlust\". The band's debut studio album, Burn This World, was released in October 2011 on Earache Records.\nDuring early 2012, The Browning toured with Fear Factory and Shadows Fall on the Noise in the Machine Tour.

Their electronic side incorporates hardstyle, trance, electronica, and dubstep, while their metal side incorporates metalcore and deathcore elements. Their signature style is a hybrid of double-bass drumming, 808s, and chugging; creating a solid, pounding rhythm layered with electronics. Their lyrics focus on many different topics, such as sci-fi themed songs with aliens, zombies, vampires, Pokémon or songs with positive messages.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent\n\nJonny McBee – lead vocals (2005–present); programming (2010–present); all instruments (2005–2010)\nBrandon Funera – drums (2024-present)\nAkeem Bivens – bass (2022–present); guitars (2023–present)\nFormer\n\nMatt Keck – lead vocals (2009–2010)\nBrian Cravey – guitars (2010–2011)\nDustin Albright – guitars (2011–2012)\nJesse Glidewell – bass (2010–2012)\nNoah Robertson – drums (2010–2012)\nDrew Ellis – bass (2012–2015); guitars (2012)\nAlex Maggard – guitars, backing vocals (2015–2016)\nRick Lalicker – bass (2016–2018)\nBrian Moore – guitars (2016–2021); bass (2015–2016)\nCollin Woroniak – bass (2018–2022); backing vocals (2011–2015, 2018–2022); guitars (2011–2015, 2021–2022)\nJon Yadon Jr. – guitars (2022–2023)\nCody Stewart – drums (2012–2024)\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n2010: Standing on the Edge\n2011: Time Will Tell\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2013: \"Gravedigger\"\n2016: \"Pure Evil\"\n2016: \"Dragon\"\n2016: \"Disconnect\"\n2016: \"Pathologic\"\n2018: \"Carnage\" ft.

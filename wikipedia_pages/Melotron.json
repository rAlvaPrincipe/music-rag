    "text": "Melotron is a futurepop and synthpop band from Germany. In 1995 Andy Krueger, Edgar Slatnow and Kay Hildebrandt left their former band, The Vermin, to form Melotron.  The band found success with their first single, \"Dein Meister,\" in 1998. Their 2007 single \"Das Herz\" charted at no. 81 in the German mainstream charts.\nUntil 2007, Melotron was a band with mostly German-only lyrics (the chorus of the B-Side \"2 Young 2 Die\" on their inaugural single release, \"Dein Meister\", was sung in English amid German verses).  However, on their album Propaganda, \"Broken\" is sung entirely in English.\nMelotron has performed at a number of major electronic and industrial festivals, amongst these the Wave Gotik Treffen festival in 1999, 2003,\n2004, 2005, and 2012, and the M'era Luna Festival in 2001, 2003, and 2005.\nIn the American television show Saturday Night Live, the recurring sketch \"Deep House Dish\" uses Melotron's song \"Der Kosmonaut\" as an opening.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nMörderwerk (1999)\nFortschritt (2000)\nWeltfrieden (2002)\nSternenstaub (2003)\nCliché (2005)\nPropaganda (2007)\nWerkschau (2014)\nFür Alle (2018)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nDein Meister (1998)\nDer Blaue Planet (1999)\nKindertraum V1 (1999)\nKindertraum V2 (1999)\nDJ Traum (1999)\nTanz mit dem Teufel (2000) – #88 DAC Top Singles of 2000\nE.P.

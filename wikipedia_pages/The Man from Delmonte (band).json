    "text": "The Man from Delmonte are an independent band from Manchester, England, formed in the mid-1980s.\n\n\n== History ==\nBand members included Mike West (vocals and acoustic guitar), Sheila Seal (bass), Martin Vincent (guitar), and Howard Goody (drums).\nThe band members had little in common with most Manchester bands. Goody was a graduate of Winchester School of Art. Vincent had been an art critic and painter. Seal, a Glaswegian, was a classically trained musician who had run an art gallery. And West, who wrote the songs, was the Australian-born son of the author Morris West.\nThe band played many gigs at the Boardwalk club, in Manchester, where they recorded their Big Noise live album in 1989.\nThey took their name from a series of 1980s television advertisements for Del Monte fruit juices, featuring the \"man from Del Monte\". In these, the man would visit villages to sample their fruit juices, to see if they were good enough to be included in his company's drinks. The tagline, shouted jubilantly by a villager on approval was, \"The man from Del Monte, he say 'Yes!'\".\nAt one point they were managed by the journalist Jon Ronson.\nAfter they split up in 1990, some members continued as Surfurbia. West moved to New Orleans to pursue a solo career in the early 1990s.\nIn September 2024 in a Facebook post it was announced that they were reforming to do a gig in Manchester, this was with the help of Iain Lee a former TV show host and comedian. The gig, to be held at the 500 capacity Band on the Wall in Manchester, sold out within 30 minutes.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nChart placings shown are from the UK Indie Chart.\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Drive, Drive, Drive\" (Ugly Man, 1987)\n\"Water in My Eyes\" (Ugly Man, 1987)\n\"Will Nobody Save Louise\" (Ugly Man, 1988) (#13)\nMonday Morning After EP (Bop Cassettes, 1989)\n\"Big Noise\" (Bop Cassettes, 1989) (#20)\n\"My Love Is Like A Gift You Can't Return\" (Bop Cassettes, 1989) (#13)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nCatholic Boys on Mobilettes (Bop Cassettes, 1989) – compilation\nBig Noise (Bop Cassettes, 1989)\nBig Noise (Vinyl Japan, 2000) – reissue\nThe Good Things in Life (Vinyl Japan, 1999) – compilation\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTruckstop Honeymoon\nAnnouncement of The Man From Del Monte reforming via Facebook post"

    "text": "White Arrows is a psych-pop group from Los Angeles, California. The band consists of Mickey Church, Andrew Naeve, John Paul Caballero and Jake Nielsen. They formed in 2011.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhite Arrows, a psychedelic pop band, began on a whim when writing a song in New York City that immediately got attention from blogs including Nylon magazine.  Mickey never thought of being in a band or playing music before this, but after getting such immediate attention it was difficult to not take advantage.  Soon thereafter, Mickey took the name to Los Angeles to form the band with Andrew Naeve, John Paul Caballero, and Steven Vernet.  Mickey and Andrew began writing, producing and remixing music together. Not long after, White Arrows began touring the world.  Since their debut tour with Cults, they have toured with many other bands, including White Denim, The Naked and Famous, !!!, Santigold and The Neighbourhood.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent Members\n\nMickey Church – vocals, guitar\nAndrew Naeve – guitar, keys\nJohn Paul Caballero – bass, keys\nJake Nielsen – drums\nPast Members\n\nRob Banks\nSteven Vernet\n\n\n== Discography ==\nGet Gone 7\"  (2011)\n\nReleased by Brooklyn-based Ooh La La Records in September 2011.\nDry Land Is Not A Myth (2012)\nAfter having RAC do a mix of their song Coming Or Going, White Arrows asked him to produce their entire debut album with band member Andrew Naeve.

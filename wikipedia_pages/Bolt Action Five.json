    "text": "Bolt Action Five were a dance-punk/industrial band from London, England, composed of Tobias J Hughes, Ian William Galloway, Holly Murtha and Mark Murphy. They formed in early 2006 from a variety of different members and appeared repeatedly in Artrocker and PlayMusic magazines, as well as in NME, i-D, Disorder Magazine and various online music journals.\nThe band seemed to have difficulty describing their sound, variously categorising themselves as indie rock, electro, industrial pop, dance-punk, or electro-metal. In interviews they listed Devo, Nine Inch Nails, Wire, Prince and Michael Jackson as influences.\nThe band split on 26 March 2008.\n\n\n== Members ==\nTobias J Hughes – guitar\nHolly Murtha – vocals, keyboards\nIan William Galloway – bass, keyboards, samplers, drum machines\nMark Murphy – keyboards, vocals, drum machines\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Releases ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\"Spring Heeled Jack\" – on Playmusic magazine compilation (October 2006)\n\"Gurl Howl\" – on Artrocker magazine compilation (December 2006)\n\"Tree Friend Tree Foe\" – on Japanese compilation (October 2007)\n\"Can The Freedom (Barringtone Remix)\" – on Artrocker magazine compilation (December 2007)\n\n\n== See also ==\nDance-punk\nIndustrial music\nNew Cross\n\n\n== Sources ==\nArtrocker, \"The Friday Review,\" Issue 48, Page 22\nArtrocker, \"Soundcheck,\" Issue 4, Page 10\nNME, \"What's On The NME Stereo?,\" 30 March 2007\nZoo, \"10 New Tracks,\" 30 March 2007\nProfile - from The Guardian New Bands\nReview, Stealth, Nottingham - from FRINKmusic"

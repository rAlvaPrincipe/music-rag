The group recorded two studio albums, one live album, and sold over 1,500,000 records worldwide. Formed in 1997, Floetry started on the performance poetry stage. They have worked with many US musicians and artists including: Jill Scott, Queen Latifah, Michael Jackson, Common, The Roots, Bilal, and more founders of neo soul.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings: 1994–2002 ===\nMarsha Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart first met on the basketball courts in London, England. There they quickly transitioned from rivals to friends, bonding over their love for music and poetry. The first collaboration came when Ambrosius contacted Stewart about adding poetry to the chorus of a song she was working on called 'Fantasize'. Stewart invited Ambrosius onstage to perform the song at her show a few months later. Their connection was felt all throughout the venue, with many people crying during the show. In 1997, the duo began writing music together and constantly performing in the music venues of London. After three years the duo moved to U.S., first living in Atlanta but later moving to Philadelphia where much success was found. Since moving to the U.S. in 2000, they have written for Jill Scott, Jazz of Dru Hill, Glenn Lewis (Marsha only), Bilal, and Michael Jackson, for whom Marsha penned the hit 2002 single \"Butterflies\".\n\n\n=== Floetic and Floacism: 2002–2003 ===\nIn the year of 2002, Floetry signed with DreamWorks Records and released their debut album Floetic, which featured the singles \"Floetic\", \"Say Yes\" (released March 2003), and \"Getting Late\". \"Say Yes\" stayed on the Hot 100 billboard charts for 20 weeks, peaking at number 24 on 14 June 2003.

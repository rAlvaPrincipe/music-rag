The group name originated as a reference from a TED Talk, in which visual artist Peter Tunney described his mentor, Jonas Salk, as a \"giant\", then clarifying it was not the man's physical nature he was describing, but his ability to think big. Inspired by this, the band motto became \"You don't have to be big to be a giant\".\nIn 2015, Magic Giant released its freshman self-titled EP, notably featuring Dave Matthews Band’s Rashawn Ross and Capital Cities’ Spencer Ludwig and made the debut live performance of the year on KEXP's The Morning Show hosted by John Richards.

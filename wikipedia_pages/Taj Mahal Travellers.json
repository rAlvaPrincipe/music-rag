    "text": "The Taj Mahal Travellers (also given variously as Taj Mahal Travelers, Taj-Mahal Travellers, etc.) were a Japanese experimental music ensemble founded in 1969 by former Group Ongaku leader and Fluxus member Takehisa Kosugi. The rest of the group were several years younger than Kosugi, and were all inspired by the spirit of the day. They chose mainly to perform their music outdoors, often on beaches and hilltops, creating spontaneously improvised drones (compare with Dronology), often using standard musical instruments, albeit in unconventional ways (e.g., a bowed double bass placed flat on its back). The group's sound was heavily reliant on electronic processing, particularly delay effects.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nTakehisa Kosugi: electric violin, harmonica, voice etc.\nRyo Koike: electric double bass, santur, voice, etc.\nYukio Tsuchiya: tuba, percussion, etc.\nSeiji Nagai: trumpet, Mini-Korg synthesizer, tympani, etc.\nMichihiro Kimura: voice, percussion, mandolin, etc.\nTokio Hasegawa: voice, percussion, etc.\nKinji Hayashi: electronic technique\n\n\n== Discography ==\nLive Stockholm July 1971\nFirst issue (unauthorized): Double CD, Drone Syndicate DS-01/02, 2001\nSecond issue (authorized): Double CD, Super Fuji Discs FJSP-51/52, 2008\nJuly 15, 1972\nalbum, CBS Japan SOCM-95, 1972\nRe-issue: CD, Showboat SWAX-501, 2002\nOz Days Live Compilation also featuring Les Rallizes Denudes and Acid Seven Group (Taj Mahal Travellers has one track only)\nDouble LP, with Les Rallizes Dénudés, 1973\nAugust 1974\nDouble LP, CBS Japan OP-7147-8-N, 1975\nRe-issue: Double CD, P-Vine PCD-1463/4, 1998\n\n\n== External links ==\nTaj Mahal Travellers at AllMusic\n[1] at Discogs\nDiscography/Biography at SoundOhm\nTour documentary at Ubu.com"

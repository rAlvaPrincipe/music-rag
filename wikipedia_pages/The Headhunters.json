    "text": "The Headhunters are an American jazz fusion band formed by Herbie Hancock in 1973. The group fused jazz, funk, and rock music.\n\n\n== History and band name ==\nHancock had grown dissatisfied with his prior band, Mwandishi, and wanted to make a band with a stronger funk component. He chose the name of the group, \"Headhunters\", while doing Buddhist chanting. The name pleased him because it made a triple reference to the jungle, to intellectual concerns, and to sexual activity.\nIn 1973, the band comprised Hancock (keyboards), Bennie Maupin (saxophone, clarinet), Harvey Mason (drums), Paul Jackson (bass), and Bill Summers (percussion). Their first album, Head Hunters, sold more than one million copies.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Chronology ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Headhunters on AllMusic\nThe Headhunters on discogs\n\"The Headhunters\".

    "text": "De Jeugd Van Tegenwoordig (The Youth of Today) is a Dutch hip hop and R&B group based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, renowned for their musical approach of irreverent, humorous lyrics and electronic beats. Their humorous style is characterized by their frequent use of word play, lyrical flirting with languages other than Dutch and the propagating of neologisms, such as \"Watskeburt?!\" (cf. the English wassup).\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe group consists of producer Bas Bron and rappers Vjèze Fur (real name Freddie Tratlehner), also known as Vieze Freddie, Faberyayo (real name Pepijn Lanen), also known as P. Dronq or P. Fabergé or Peppie, and WiWa (real name Ollicio Locadia), also known as Willie Wartaal. When singing about his younger self WiWa also calls himself \"Wiwaleantje\" (little Wiwalean).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe group originated from a project coordinated by Bas Bron to produce tracks with rapping from different Dutch rappers. Bron worked together with Pepijn Lanen to produce Dutch rapmusic under the name De Spaarndammerbuurtkliek. After watskeburt became a popular slang in Amsterdam, the two of them decided to create a song on it, which at first this was meant to stay between friends. Freddy Tratlehner, who knew Lanen as a rapper and was part of the group that popularised the word, brought a mutual friend to the studio to record and they eventually decided that he would be rapping in the song.\nTratlehner, who was already acquainted with Olivier Locadia, formed a rap group named Baksteen. Locadia did not rap on Watskeburt?!, but later on recorded the song Voorjekijkendoorlopen with Bron and Tratlehner. Bron decided to record an album with the three of them. The inspiration for the name De Jeugd Van Tegenwoordig came from a T-shirt that Lanen's brother wore with that phrase printed on it. The name was meant to be slightly ironic since they were already in their early twenties when the band started.\nDuring interviews about the release of Watskeburt?!, De Jeugd Van Tegenwoordig liked to spread ridiculous stories on the origin of the song. Lanen would tell people that he found the lyrics of the song in the subway. The biography that would be released with the song, says that the three met each other at an audition for Idols. These statements where picked up by a few media outlets, usually the three would change the story to make it sound more ridiculous in other interviews.\n\n\n=== Watskeburt?! ===\nThe beat for Watskeburt?! was produced by Bas Bron in late 2004. The only two rappers on the song are Vieze Fur and Faberyayo. The phrase 'Watskeburt' derived from a text message that the Dutch rapper Heist Rockah send to his cousin.\nOn 16 May 2005, the single Watskeburt?! was released by Magnetron Music in collaboration with Top Notch. In the first place it did not catch on, but it was discovered by several radio stations. Within a month it reached the Dutch Top 40. The song became a hit and took the number one position several days later. In the same week De Jeugd were scheduled to perform the support act for Snoop Dogg at Ahoy. In August 2005 they performed at Lowlands\nLike many notable hits, there were parodies for Watskeburt?!. Waarsmebird and Opkeplurt are a few examples of this. There were also German, Frysian and West-Frysian versions of the song. There was a parody group called De Student van Tegenwoordig with a parody called Noggeneukt?!, which was a famous in the student city Utrecht. In Groningen there was a parody called Supermooi!. After the release of Watskeburt?!, the online youth magazine Spunk translated the lyrics to German with the title Watspassiert?!\n\n\n=== Parels Voor De Zwijnen ===\nOn 23 August 2005, the group received a scoop with the song Voorjekijkendoorlopen by being the first Dutch band to release a song as ringtone before presenting it as a single.

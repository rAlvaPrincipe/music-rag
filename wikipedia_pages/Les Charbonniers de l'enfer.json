    "text": "Les Charbonniers de l'Enfer are an a cappella folk music group formed in Quebec, Canada, in 1994.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group is part of a revival in interest in Quebec's folk music. It was formed by five experienced singers who have been part of the regional folk music scene for more than 30 years: Michel Faubert, Normand Miron, Jean-Claude Mirandette, Michel Bordeleau, and André Marchand. Their instrumental accompaniment is limited to the jaw harp and foot tapping. The musicians also work in other projects and the band's appearances are relatively rare. The group includes two former members of La Bottine Souriante (Bordeleau and Marchand).\nOn their 2010 album Nouvelles fréquentations (New Visits), Les Charbonniers de l'Enfer tackle a contemporary repertoire. This includes, among others, works by Neil Young, Félix Leclerc, Noir Désir, Daniel Lanois, Plume Latraverse, Steven \"Cassonade\" Faulkner, Daniel Lavoie, Florent Vollant, Dédé Fortin, the McGarrigle sisters, Marcel Martel, and Bertolt Brecht. This album earned them nominations from ADISQ as well as the Canadian Folk Music Awards.\nIn 2017, they released the album 25 ans de grande noirceur (25 Years of Great Darkness), a compilation of 13 songs selected from their complete repertoire.\nJean-Claude Mirandette died in 2018.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent\n\nMichel Bordeleau\nMichel Faubert\nAndré Marchand\nNormand Miron\nPast\n\nJean-Claude Mirandette\n\n\n== Discography ==\nChansons a cappella (1996)\nWô (2002)\nEn concert à la Tulippe : \"En personne\" (2005)\nÀ la grâce de Dieu (2007)\nLa Traverse miraculeuse with La Nef (2008)\nNouvelles fréquentations (2010)\n25 ans de grande noirceur (2017)\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nLa sacrée rencontre (Gilles Vigneault and Les Charbonniers de l'enfer - 2007)\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\n\nFélix Award – Album of the year – Traditional Music – for Wô (2003)\nNomination: ADISQ – Best CD cover – for Wô (2003)\nFélix Award – Album of the year – Traditional Music – for En concert à la Tulippe : \"En personne\" (2006)\nCanadian Folk Music Awards Prize – Best Group of the Year (2007)\nNomination: ADISQ – Album of the year – for À la grace de Dieu (2008)\nFélix Award – Album of the year – Traditional Music – La Nef & Les Charbonniers de l'Enfer (2009)\nNomination: Canadian Folk Music Awards – Album of the Year – Contemporary Vocal Group of the Year – for Nouvelles fréquentations (2011)\nNomination: ADISQ – Album of the year – Revivals, Performance of the year – for Nouvelles fréquentations (2011)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Canadian Folk Music Awards"

    "text": "Regular Fries were an English electronica/rock group. Their style was surreal and infused with the space age. Although chart success eluded them they received rave reviews in the music media from NME, Rolling Stone and Loaded, who were once moved to call them \"the best rock'n'roll  band in the world\". On their split in March 2001, songwriter Paul Moody announced \"We hate the charts and the charts hate us. We're off into the cosmos!\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 1997 in North London by graphic designer Will Beaven (keyboards), music journalist Paul Moody (synthesizer, vibes), and film-maker Andy Starke (drums). The line-up was completed by Dave Brothwell (vocals), Rich Little (vocals, percussion), Pat O'Sullivan (bass), and Stephen Griffin (guitar). Sometimes regarded part of the \"skunk rock\" movement, the band became known for their extravagant live shows. After touring with the Lo Fidelity Allstars, the band's debut album, Accept the Signal, was released in 1999, followed the next year by War on Plastic Plants, which included a collaboration with Kool Keith on \"Coke N Smoke (Supersonic Waves)\". Their third and final album while together, Blueprint for a Higher Civilization, was released in 2001, the band splitting up the same year.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nAccept the Signal (June 1999) JBO\nWar On Plastic Plants (2000) JBO\nBlueprint for a Higher Civilisation (2001) Soft City/Sony\nPhone in Sick (Compilation) (2004)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Dust It, Don't Bust It\" (1997) Fierce Panda (split 7-inch with Campag Velocet)\n\"Dust It, Don't Bust It (full version)\" 12-inch EP (1998) Rabid Badger\nFree The Regular Fries EP (September 1998) JBO\nFries Entertainment EP (1998) JBO\n\"King Kong\" (June 1999) JBO\n\"Dust It\" (1999) JBO\nSmokin' Cigars With The Pharaohs EP (2000) JBO\n\"Supersonicwaves\" (2000) JBO\n\"Eclipse\" (2001) JBO (withdrawn)\nTransmissions From the War Office vol. 1 EP (2001) Soft City\n\"Afrika\" (2001) Soft City\n\n\n== References =="

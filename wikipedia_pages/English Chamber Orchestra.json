    "text": "The English Chamber Orchestra (ECO) is a British chamber orchestra based in London. The full orchestra regularly plays concerts at Cadogan Hall, and their ensemble performs at Wigmore Hall. With a limited performance size, the orchestra specializes in 18th-century music and was created to perform Baroque Music. The orchestra regularly tours in the UK and internationally, and holds the distinction of having the most extensive discography of any chamber orchestra and being the most well-traveled orchestra in the world; no other orchestra has played concerts (as of 2013, according to its own publicity) in as many countries as the English Chamber Orchestra.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe English Chamber Orchestra has its origins in the Goldsbrough Orchestra, founded in 1948 by Lawrence Leonard and Arnold Goldsbrough. The group took its current name in 1960, when it expanded its repertoire beyond the Baroque period for the first time. Its repertoire remained limited by the group's size, which has stayed fairly consistently at around the size of an orchestra of Mozart's time.\nShortly afterwards, it became closely associated with the Aldeburgh Festival, playing in the premieres of Benjamin Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1960), Owen Wingrave (1970), Curlew River and several other of his works. The occasions on which Britten conducted the orchestra included the opening concerts of the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Snape Maltings in 1967. He also made a number of records with the group.\nThe orchestra did not at this time have a principal conductor, but worked closely with a succession of guest conductors including Raymond Leppard, Colin Davis and Daniel Barenboim. In 1985 Jeffrey Tate was appointed the ensemble's first principal conductor.  In 2000, Ralf Gothóni was appointed second principal conductor.\nIn June 2009, the English Chamber Orchestra named Paul Watkins its new music director, effective with the 2009–2010 season, for an initial contract of three years. The orchestra has also worked regularly with guest conductors Paul Goodwin, Lawrence Power and James Sherlock. In 2023, the orchestra appointed Roberto Forés Veses as Principal Guest Conductor. Having led the orchestra for over 30 years, Stephanie Gonley was recognised as Leader and Principal of the English Chamber Orchestra in 2023. \n\n\n== Tours and performances ==\nThe orchestra has performed with and toured the UK and abroad with artists such as Kathleen Battle, Benjamin Britten, Daniel Barenboim, Dame Janet Baker, Colin Davis, Placido Domingo, Jacqueline du Pre, Sumi Jo, Kiri te Kanawa, Yehudi Menuhin, Luciano Pavarotti, Murray Perahia, Itzhak Perlman, Andre Previn, Karl Richter, Mstislav Rostropovich, Georg Solti, Joan Sutherland, Mitsuko Uchida, Maxim Vengerov and Pinchas Zukerman.\nRecent tours have included Bermuda, USA, Mexico, Finland, France, Turkey, Switzerland, Italy and Germany.\nHRH the former Prince of Wales has been the Patron of the ECO since 1977 and the orchestra has performed at royal weddings, birthday celebrations and other events including the first concert ever to be broadcast from Buckingham Palace. \nIn 2023 members of the orchestra were selected to play at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla.\n\n\n== Select recordings ==\n\n\n=== Concertos ===\nBach Brandenburg Concertos 1 - 6 under Benjamin Britten, Decca (1969)\nBach The Brandenburg Concertos under Johannes Somary, Vanguard (2008)\nBach Violin Concertos with Anne-Sophie Mutter and Salvatore Accardo, EMI (1983)\nBach Violin Concertos with Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman under Daniel Barenboim, EMI (1986)\nBach Violin Concertos and Triple Concerto with Arthur Grumiaux under Raymond Leppard, Philips (1964)\nBeethoven Violin Concerto with Frank Peter Zimmermann under Jeffrey Tate, EMI (1988)\nHandel Twelve Grand Concertos under Raymond Leppard, Philips (1968)\nHaydn Cello Concerto with Mstislav Rostropovich under Benjamin Britten, Decca (1964)\nHaydn Cello Concerto and Boccherini Cello Concerto with Jacqueline Du Pré under Daniel Barenboim, EMI (1967)\nHaydn Cello Concertos with Yo-Yo Ma, Sony Classical (1986).\nHaydn, C.

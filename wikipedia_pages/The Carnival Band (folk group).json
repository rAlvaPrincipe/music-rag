    "text": "The Carnival Band is an English early music group. Their broad repertoire focuses on popular music from \nthe 16th and 17th centuries, and traditional music from around the world. Presentation is informal and humorous, and in the spirit of medieval and renaissance Carnival. The band was founded by Andy Watts (principal bassoon in the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment) and Giles Lewin (Dufay Collective) while they were members of the Medieval Players touring theatre company in the 1980s. They have had a long association with Maddy Prior.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was founded in 1983 by Andy Watts and Giles Lewin, together with Bill Badley, after Watts had been the musical director of an open-air Medieval Players production of Rabelais' Gargantua. The show featured actors, giant carnival characters, puppets, acrobatics, juggling and 16th-century music. The three founding members were musicians with the Medieval Players. Together with percussionist Charles Fullbrook the quartet made their debut on the towpath of the Leeds-Liverpool canal at the Burnley Canalside Festival in 1984. Andrew 'Jub' Davis joined the band for a New Years' concert in 1985 and, according to the band's website \"this date marks the band's real birthday.\" There have been four lineup changes since then:\n\nCharles Fullbrook left in 1990 and Raph Mizraki took his place.\nSteve Banks joined in 1999 when Raph Mizraki moved on\nBill Badley stopped appearing regularly\nSteno Vitale joined in 2002 to form the current line-up.\nBill Bradley and Raph Mizraki both continue to make occasional guest appearances with the band.\nMaddy Prior's collaboration with the band began near the start of their existence in 1984 for a BBC radio programme of Christmas carols. Since then, Maddy has featured on most Carnival Band albums. They have co-written material. For example, they wrote and toured a song cycle based on the life of Worcester-born heroine Hannah Snell. Maddy toured with them again in 2007 for their \"Music for Tavern and Chapel\" tour.\nOther performers have appeared on their CDs. For example, Rose Kemp sang on Carols at Christmas and Terry Jones appeared on Ringing the Changes.\n\n\n== Current members ==\nAndy Watts shawm/curtal/bagpipes/recorder\nGiles Lewin violin/recorder\nSteve Banks percussion/violin\nSteno Vitale guitar/mandolin\nJub Davis double bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHoi Polloi (Park 1999 PRKCD51)\nLive â€“ Jump for Joy (1994)\nMy Heart Doth Dance (Park 2007)\nChoral History: Radio Ballards (2008)\nAround the World (2010)\nCapriol's Christmas (2018)\n\n\n=== with Maddy Prior ===\nA Tapestry of Carols (Saydisc 1986 CD-SDL 366)\nSing Lustily And With Good Courage (Saydisc 1990 CD-SDL 383)\nCarols and Capers (Park Records 1991 PRKCD9)\nHang Up Sorrow and Care (1995)\nCarols at Christmas (Park Records 1996 PRKCD45)\nGold Frankincense and Myrrh (Park Records 2001 PRKCD59)\nAn Evening of Carols and Capers (Park Records 2005 DVD PRKDVD87, CD PRKCD86)\nParadise Found (Park Records 2007 PRKCD94)\nRinging the Changes (Park Records 2007 PRKCD98)\nVaughan Williams Carols Songs & Hymns (Park Records 2010 PRKCD111)\nA Christmas Caper: The Best of Maddy Prior & the Carnival Band (Park Records 2012 PRKCD124)\n\n\n== Instruments played by the band ==\nSing Lustily\nBill Badley: Lute, guitar (19th century original), steel-string guitar, mandolin, mandocello, banjo, vocals\nCharles Fullbrook: Tabors, side drum, bass drum, cymbals, wood blocks, cowbell, vocals\nJub Davis: Double bass\nGiles Lewin: Violin, recorder (2, 13), vocals\nAndy Watts: Curtal, bassoon (19th century original), clarinet in C, recorder (2, 7, 14), vocals\nHang Up Sorrow And Care\nWilliam Badley (acoustic & electric guitars, baroque guitar, lute, banjo, mandolin, vocals)\nGiles Lewin (mandolin, violin, recorder, hoboy, vocals)\nAndrew Watts (Flemish bagpipes, shalmes, curtal, recorder, melodica, kazoo, vocals)\nJub Davis (double bass, vocals)\nRafaello Mizraki (drums, percussion, cello, Hammond organ, vocals)\n\n\n== See also ==\nRed Priest\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSaydisc Records\nBill Badley"

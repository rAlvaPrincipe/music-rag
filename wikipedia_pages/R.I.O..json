    "text": "R.I.O. is a German dance music band. The members are Yann Peifer and DJ Manian, who originally founded the band in 2007. Until 2012, Tony T. was part of the band. Their biggest hit was the song \"Turn This Club Around\", which charted in the top 5 in Germany and Austria and at number one in Switzerland.\n\n\n== Production and members ==\nDJs Manian and Yanou founded R.I.O. in the middle of 2007, after success with joint projects such as Cascada and Tune Up!. R.I.O. was initially intended as an \"experimental project\". The name is derived from their first recording with the same title, as well as the re-release as \"De Janeiro\". In their songs Manian and Yanou are active as songwriter, composer and producer. Andres Ballinas, a good friend of the duo, collaborated as an author.\nIn 2008, Tony T. joined the group as the lead singer. Their debut song with him was \"Shine On\", where he played Jesus Christ (from Nazareth) in its music video. He then went on to play this same role in all the songs and music videos until 2011.\nIn addition to their own releases, they often appear as remixers. Songs by artists who record for their own label Zooland Records, for example the ItaloBrothers or King & White, as well as old and new single releases of the members Manian and Yanou are mixed by them irregularly in the ordinary R.I.O.-style.\nInitially they released their songs on Zooland until they signed a contract with German label Kontor Records in 2011. Previously they had published individual songs on Kontor, but no contract was reached until 2011. Two more contracts for the international publication of their songs closed in 2011 with Swedish record label Roxy Recordings and Dutch label Spinnin' Records.\n\nOn music videos and live performances, Manian and Yanou stayed in the background. Since the entry of British singer, rapper and DJ of Jamaican origin Tony T. (Neal Antone Dyer) in 2007, he was the face and voice of R.I.O.. American born-German pop, R&B and hip-hop artist U-Jean (Alex Hutson) was used in some recordings. In 2012 \"Party Shaker\" was sung by Nicco. This confirmed that R.I.O. was a project of two DJs featuring various voices. At live performances still U-Jean represented the duo.\nAfter Tony T. left the project, R.I.O. became known as a duo consisting of Manian and Yanou with U-Jean performing at their concerts and in videos. Songs sung by U-Jean are credited as \"R.I.O. feat. U-Jean\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2007: Origin ===\nYanou and Manian experimented in their studio, producing a cover of \"Samba de Janeiro Bellini\". The title was called \"R.I.O.\" which was released as a single, but only in the form of remixes by artists such as Spencer & Hill, Stereo Palma or as MYPD, Manian and Yanou themselves. The track appeared on many labels throughout Europe. Although in Germany, it met limited success, in Spain, their version advanced to the top 10.\nThey picked up this project in the winter of 2007 and mixed the track again. On 9 November 2007 the song appeared in stores re-recorded as \"De Janeiro\". The original track \"R.I.O.\" appeared on this single as a Spencer & Hill Remix. In no time the track became an international club anthem. The single reached number 8 on the Spanish chart and number 14 in the Netherlands.\n\n\n=== 2008-2009: \"Shine On\" ===\nA few months after the release of \"De Janeiro\", the duo released \"Cool\" by Lowrida in February 2008. In May Yanou remixed \"Children of the Night\". The two Cologne producers discovered the 36-year-old British singer and rapper Tony T., who eventually joined the project as vocalist and frontman. Shortly thereafter, they began as a trio to work on new songs and preparing their debut album.\nIn June, they released their first single \"Shine On\". Its popularity reached southern Europe and the entire Middle East, charted in most European countries, including peaking at number 25 in Germany, 21 in Austria, 17 in Switzerland and 22 in Spain. The video pulled over 30 million YouTube views. In September 2008, they performed a third time as a producer team.\nThe follow-up was \"Turn the Tide\" with R.I.O. member Manian and singer Alia. The original came from the vocal trance project Sylver from 2000.\nIn December, \"When the Sun Comes Down\" appeared. In November 2008, they were picked on the \"Kontor Top of the Clubs Vol 41\". The single reached the top ten of the Dutch Top 40 and Spanish chart and number 22 in the Dutch Top 100. It saw lesser success in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

In Austria, the track reached number 41 and number 65 in Germany, Netherlands and Portugal. In October the trio mixed the song \"Brighter Day\" and in November \"Serenade\" as a download.

McCarthy were credited as songwriter.\n\n\n=== 2010: First album ===\nIn 2010, they collaborated with Dutch singer Liz Kay. Their collaboration led to \"Something About You\" and \"Watching You\".

Neither of these releases reached the Top 100.\nThe seventh single \"One Heart\" appeared in three variations. It was once considered a two-track single in February in the Netherlands. Similarly, the song was released as a double single with \"Can You Feel It\", in some countries, as well as a three-single with \"Can You Feel It\" and \"Lay Down\" in April in the rest of Europe.

It appeared on 13 July on YouTube, and was viewed over two million times. The only commercial success was in the Netherlands. \"Hot Girl\" is one of their biggest club successes. In addition, the track marked their transition from reggae to house style.\n\n\n=== 2011: \"Sunshine\" and \"Turn This Club Around\" ===\n\nOn 11 February 2011, R.I.O. published \"Like I Love You\" as the first single and an announcement for their second studio album Sunshine.

The song debuted on number 48 in Germany, 51 in Switzerland and peaked at 33 on the Austrian chart.

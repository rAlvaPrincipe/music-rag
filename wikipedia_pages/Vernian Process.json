    "text": "Vernian Process is an American band formed in San Francisco in 2003.  Taking its name from the works of 19th century author Jules Verne, Vernian Process is a band that creates music themed around Victorian scientific romance and its modern counterpart steampunk. Their sound is a fusion of modern and old-world styles including gothic-rock darkwave, progressive rock, neoclassical, trip hop, ragtime, and other related genres.  The band consists of vocalist Joshua A. Pfeiffer, and multi-instrumentalists Martín Irigoyen, Steven Farrell, and Vincent Van Veen.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPfeiffer began working on music under the name Vernian Process in the winter of 2003. He released a number of downloadable albums over the next 4 years, including 2004's Discovery and  2006's The Forgotten Age, before being approached by Irigoyen about joining forces to work on Behold the Machine.  From that point forward, Vernian Process evolved beyond a solo project.  Throughout 2009, as work on the album progressed, Vernian Process sought out additional members in order to play shows to support the upcoming release of Behold the Machine, as well as record new material for future albums.\nBehold the Machine was released on October 1, 2010.\nOn November 11, 2010, they announced that their next album would be titled The Consequences Of Time Travel.\nOn June 27, 2011, Vernian Process released the first single from the new album, entitled \"Something Wicked (That Way Went).\"  The song was inspired by Ray Bradbury's similarly titled dark fantasy novel Something Wicked This Way Comes.  The song integrates tarantella and circus music styles with progressive rock and features a sampled calliope. It features Kyle Thomas and Unwoman as guest musicians.\nOn October 31, 2011, they released a special remix of \"Behold the Machine\" entitled \"Behold the Machine (Factory Floor Mix).\"  The remix incorporates EBM and industrial influences.\nIn October 2014, bassist Vincent Van Veen joined the project.\n\n\n== Press ==\nVernian Process has appeared in articles in media such as the UK publication Bizarre Magazine, and MTV during their coverage of the Steampunk genre.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nJoshua A.

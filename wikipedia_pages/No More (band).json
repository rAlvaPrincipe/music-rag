    "text": "No More is a German band from Kiel founded in 1979. Their music is rooted in early post-punk/no wave.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNo More was founded by Andy A. Schwarz (vocals, guitar, bass), Tina Sanudakura (synthesizers), Christian Darc (drums, vocals) and Thomas Welz (bass, vocals) in Kiel, a seaside town in the northern part of Germany.\nThe  7-inch EP  \"Too Late\" was the first release in 1980 and was recorded in a small laundry-room with a 4-track TEAC (the EP was reviewed in the German SOUNDS-magazine as \"strangely, archaic music, brute sound that seems to be recorded with a purposely damaged 4-track\").\nAfter the departure of  Thomas Welz at the end of 1980, No More worked as a trio until the end of 1983.\nThe song \"Suicide Commando\" (released in 1981 and not to be confused with the Belgian band Suicide Commando, who named themselves after that song) is the band's biggest success.  The New Musical Express described \"Suicide Commando\" as \"suitable German electro fashion\" but the song spread in the following years internationally regardless of genre and scene.  In the 1990s the song entered the Techno- and Electroscene, when it was remixed by DJ Hell and Echopark (Moguai & Torsten Stenzel).\nIn 1982 No More released the  mini-LP \"A Rose Is A Rose\" this time reviewed by the NME as \"made by a trio of young Germans who appear to have fallen out of Lou Reed´s 'Berlin' album\".  After the release of \"A Rose Is A Rose\" No More decided to change direction. The new style was a mixture of darkwave and oriental elements.\nIn 1984 Thorsten Hartung (bass) joined the band. In the slipstream of the \"Suicide Commando\" success No More started to tour Germany and the Netherlands but soon refused to play the song.  No More decided to go their separate ways at the end of 1986, shortly after finishing their album \"Hysteria\". Tina Sanudakura and Andy A. Schwarz formed the band Nijinsky Style.\nIn 2006 No More (condensed to the duo Tina Sanudakura and Andy A. Schwarz) released a new album called \"Remake/Remodel\". At the end of 2008 they started touring again and in January 2010 the single \"Sunday Mitternacht / A Rose Is A Rose\" was released. The album \"Midnight People & Lo-Life Stars\" was released in March 2010, followed by the 2012 album \"Sisyphus\".\nIn 2015 the band turned to a more Pop orientated sound with the release of the single \"Stardust Youth\" and the album \"Silence & Revolt\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums and singles ===\n1980: Too Late (7-inch Single, Too Late Records, Germany)\n1981: Suicide Commando (7-inch Single, Too Late Records, Germany)\n1982: A Rose Is A Rose (10-inch Mini-LP, Too Late Records, Germany)\n1984: Suicide Commando (12-inch Single, Roof Records / Wishbone Records, Germany)\n1984: Laughter In The Wings (12-inch Mini-LP, Wishbone Records, Germany)\n1985: Do You Dream Of Angels In This Big City?

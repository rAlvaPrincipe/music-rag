    "text": "Liquid are a British dance act, formed by Eamon Downes (a.k.a. Ame) and Shane Heneghan (a.k.a. DJ Model).\n\"Sweet Harmony\", Liquid's first and best-known track, layered the house music of CeCe Rogers' \"Someday\" over rolling breakbeats. Initially released in 1991 on the self-pressed white label Liquid EP of 500 copies, it was re-released to a wider audience on XL Recordings in the following year.\nThe \"Sweet Harmony\" single was followed by The Future Music EP which included \"Liquid Is Liquid\". Following Heneghan's departure from the group after the first two releases, Liquid's reputation for recording alternative dancefloor fillers was cemented with \"Time to Get Up\" and the flamenco guitars of \"One Love Family\" - both of which were Mixmag 'singles of the week'.\nThe first three EPs were recorded with producer Jezz Wright at Blockhouse.\nLiquid have achieved top 40 singles in the UK, and several European hits. The NME described the XL Recordings album Liquid Culture as \"sophisticated, soulful techno.\" Liquid has performed live in many countries over many years. December 2007 saw the re-release of \"Sweet Harmony\" on XL Recordings with remixes by James Talk, Dave Spoon and Streetlife DJs. A drum and bass remix of \"Sweet Harmony\" by Danny Byrd was released in early 2010.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nCulture (1995)\nEnergy Flows (2017)\nBack to Rave 1 (2018)\nSpacemonkey (2019)\nLethal (2021)\nBack to Rave 2 (2023)\nAtmospheric Rave (2023)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nLiquid EP (1991)\n\"Sweet Harmony\" (1992) - UK #15, BPI: Silver\nThe Future Music EP (1992) - UK #59\n\"Time to Get Up\" (1993) - UK #46\nLiquid Love EP (1994) - UK #93\n\"Sweet Harmony\"/\"One Love Family\" (1995) - UK #14\n\"Closer\" (1995) - UK #47\n\"Strong\" (1998) - UK #59\n\"Orlando Dawn\" (2000) - UK #53\n\"Sweet Harmony\" (2004) - UK #87\n\"Sweet Harmony\" (Danny Byrd featuring Liquid) (2010) - UK #64\n\"Toxic Drop\" (2019)\n\"Get Straight/Clout Chasing\" (with Fast Eddie) (2020)\n\"Dove Removal Machine\" (2021)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLiquid discography at Discogs"

The best musicians of Ukraine's former capital city Kharkiv were invited to join the orchestra conducted by Yakiv Rozenshteyn. The orchestra of 45 musicians was part of the radio theatre. Its first symphonic cycle featuring works by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky started soon after opening October 14 with his 5th symphony and 3rd orchestral suite.\nDue to political shifts and intern transitions the orchestra eventually moved to Ukraine's new capital Kiev and increased its number to 60 musicians. Soon becoming the only government supported symphony orchestra exclusively devoted to symphony music the orchestra continued in broadcasting, public concerts and recording for Ukraine and worldwide music labels. Especially its video-recordings proved to be highly commercially successful as the concerts being regarded national cultural highlights and added to the funds of Ukrainian Radio.\nThe orchestras achievements in preserving the musical tradition of Ukraine in particular and Eastern Europe in general, producing over 10.000 recordings of orchestral works have been met by getting awarded the title of Honored Collective and granted academic status for special merits in the development of musical art in Ukraine.\nThroughout the years the orchestra collaborated with world famous conductors such as Mykola Kolessa, Natan Rakhlin, Theodore Kuchar, Aram Gharabekian and several others – as well as toured all across Europe and Asia including Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Poland, South Korea, Iran and Algeria.\n\n\n== Conductors ==\nYakiv Rosenstein\nPeter Adler\nMykhailo Kannerstein\nPetro Polyakov\nKonstantin Simeonov\nVadym Gnedash\nVolodymyr Sirenko\nViatcheslav Blinov\nVolodymyr Sheiko\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHomepage of Ukrainian Radio Symphony Orchestra on the website of Ukrainian Radio\nOrchestra line-up"

    "text": "Mint Green is an emo-pop band from Boston, Massachusetts fronted by singer and guitarist Ronnica, with Daniel Huang on drums, and Tiffany Sammy on bass. \nIn 2023, Mint Green played Boston Calling Music Festival.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nGrowing up, Ronnica listened to Lauryn Hill and Billie Holiday in her dad’s car out of his custom speakers from his home island of Anguilla. Her mother was a singer who enjoyed soft rock and found herself at odds with Ronnica and her brother, as they loved louder groups like Korn and Linkin Park. As a teenager, Ronnica played in various rock bands. \nIn 2015, right after Ronnica graduated high school, she made a Craigslist posting seeking a drummer for a new project, which is where she found Huang. Mint Green was the first band Ronnica played in where she was lead vocalist and front-woman. The band was named for Ronnica’s favorite color which she has described as, “not too loud, not too soft” like their music.  \n\n\n== History ==\nIn November 2017, after just one EP release, the band was approached at a show by 6131 Records about a record deal. This caused two members of the band to drop out, realizing they weren’t prepared for this level of commitment to the project. \nMint Green released two independent self-funded EPs before being signed to Pure Noise Records and releasing their first full-length LP, All Girls Go to Heaven, in 2022. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References =="

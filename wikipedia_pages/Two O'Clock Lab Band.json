    "text": "The Two O'Clock Lab Band is the second highest level of nine big bands (see One O'Clock Lab Band) of the Jazz Studies Division at the University of North Texas College of Music, a comprehensive music school with the largest enrollment of any music institution accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music, and oldest (and first) in the world offering a degree in jazz studies.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhile the One O'Clock is the highest level of the nine Lab Bands; the Two O'Clock has, for several decades, held acclaim as a \"destination band\" at the University.  The Two O'Clock produces professionally engineered albums and, on concert tours, is well received.  The Band has a long list of successful alumni musicians who never played with the One O'Clock, some of whom are listed below.  \"Making\" the One O'Clock often is a matter of timing.  If, for example, several talented musicians are vying for a certain chair in the One O'Clock, and that chair is held by someone for two years, then a qualified student might likely complete his or her studies playing in another Lab Band.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1992, 1993, 1994, 2005, 2006 — Down Beat Magazine poll selected the UNT Two O'Clock Lab Band as \"Winner\" of the Annual Student Music Awards (James Riggs, director). The band has toured and performed at Walt Disney World.  National jazz radio programs, including Pandora, includes recordings from the Two O'Clock Lab Band as well as the One O'Clock.\n2005 — The Two O'Clock Lab Band was named Down Beat Magazine's best college band for 2005\n2010 — 33rd Downbeat Annual Student Music Awards: Large Jazz Ensemble, Graduate College Winner (Jay Saunders, Director)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Directed by Jim Riggs ===\n\n\n=== Directed Jay Saunders ===\n\n\n== Directors ==\nJim Riggs (retired 2008)\nJay Saunders (fall 2008 to spring 2014.

They found drummer Jeff Fabb and started the band as Dying Star. Unhappy with their musical direction, they changed their name to In This Moment and gained two band members, guitarist Blake Bunzel and bassist Josh Newell. In 2005, bassist Newell left the band and was replaced by Jesse Landry.\nTheir debut album, Beautiful Tragedy, was released in 2007. Their follow up, titled The Dream was released the following year debuting at number 73 on the Billboard 200.

They have also received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance. To date, the band has 5 singles and an album certified Platinum and Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nThe band's line-up has changed several times. Landry was replaced by Kyle Konkiel in 2009 and Konkiel was replaced by Travis Johnson in 2010. Jeff Fabb and Blake Bunzel left the band in 2011, and were replaced by Tom Hane and Randy Weitzel respectively. In March 2016, drummer Tom Hane announced his departure from the band and was replaced by Kent Diimmel, formerly of 3 By Design.\nThroughout their career, the band has performed on several notable tours and festivals including Ozzfest in 2007 and 2008; Warped Tour in 2009; Download Festival in 2009, 2013, and 2018; Mayhem Festival in 2010; Music as a Weapon V tour in 2011; Uproar Festival in 2012; Rock on the Range in 2012, 2013, and 2015; Carnival of Madness tour in 2013; Knotfest in 2014; Rockfest and Rocklahoma in 2015; Carolina Rebellion in 2018; Louder Than Life in 2017 and 2019; Aftershock in 2014, 2017, and 2021; Welcome to Rockville in 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019; and Knotfest in 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and Beautiful Tragedy (2004–2008) ===\n\nIn 2004, singer Maria Brink and guitarist Chris Howorth met through an audition. Howorth initially rejected Brink because she was a woman, but eventually accepted her as the singer of the band. Soon thereafter they enlisted the help of Los Angeles drummer Jeff Fabb and formed the band Dying Star. After two shows, Howorth departed from the band to focus on other projects. Brink encouraged Howorth to return to the band. Howorth returned and they agreed to try something new with the band. The band eventually changed their name to In This Moment. By mid-2005, the lineup included Brink, Howorth, Fabb, guitarist Blake Bunzel, and bassist Josh Newell. The band recorded demos and posted them on MySpace. In late 2005, Newell departed from the band to focus on his work in music production. Producer Pascual Romero was then the bassist for a time before a friend of the band Jesse Landry was eventually tapped to round out the band permanently. Rob \"Blasko\" Nicholson, the bassist for Ozzy Osbourne became the band's manager after discovering them through MySpace.\nBy the end of 2005, In This Moment had generated a fanbase through internet marketing and do-it-yourself touring. This sparked an interest from Century Media Records, and a worldwide record deal followed. The band released their debut album Beautiful Tragedy on March 20, 2007, backed by the singles \"Prayers\", and title track \"Beautiful Tragedy\". The album was produced by Eric Rachel and combined sounds of metalcore and hard rock while the lyrics drew from Brink's personal experiences about abandonment and tragedies. The vocals on the songs alternate between Brink singing and screaming. The band performed on several tours including The Hottest Chicks in Metal Tour 2007 with Lacuna Coil, Ozzfest in 2007 and 2008, Megadeth, and the Rob Zombie and Ozzy Osbourne tour. They recorded a cover of Lacuna Coil's \"Heaven's a Lie\" with the band Manntis as part of \"Century Media Records's Covering 20 Years of Extreme cover album.\n\n\n=== The Dream (2008–2009) ===\n\nIn This Moment released their second album named The Dream on September 30, 2008. The album received mostly positive reviews and marked the band's debut on the Billboard 200, debuting at number 73. The album was produced by Kevin Churko and featured a less heavy approach, with a bigger focus on clean vocals from Brink. The song \"Forever\" was released as the album's lead single. To support the release, the band went on tour with Five Finger Death Punch, Mudvayne, Papa Roach, and Filter. They also appeared on the Give It a Name tour in the UK and were on the 2009 Warped Tour line-up, playing on the Ernie Ball Stage. They also played at Download Festival 2009 on the second stage.

They also revealed that they were set to enter the studio on February 23 to begin recording their fifth studio album and follow up to Blood. Chris Howorth said, \"We have a bunch of ideas and the way we did Blood was different than we'd done any album before. We brought ideas and pieces and parts into the studio and wrote each song in the studio, one at a time. All the other albums we had the songs formatted and together already. So we're going to do the same thing again. We're gonna try to replicate the magic of Blood and try to take the style and sound we had for Blood and just do it bigger and better while still keeping true to that same vibe. That's our sound. We feel like we found something and want to stick the flag in the ground on top of that hill.\"\nThe first single, \"Sick Like Me\" from the band's album, Black Widow, was released on September 9, 2014.

    "text": "Caribbean Jazz Project was a Latin jazz band founded in 1993. The original group featured Dave Samuels, Paquito D'Rivera, and Andy Narell. After their second album, D'Rivera and Narell left the group, although both returned as guest stars. Under Samuels' leadership, the group explored different genres of latin jazz with a changing membership and numerous guest artists. The band released nine albums under the Caribbean Jazz Project name and one as the featured backing band for jazz singer Diane Schuur. The final album with Samuels, Afro Bop Alliance, featured the Maryland-based Afro Bop Alliance Big Band led by drummer Joe McCarthy and won the 2008 Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album.  McCarthy's latin jazz big band continues to record under its own name, and Samuels retains the group's name.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Caribbean Jazz Project (Heads Up, 1995)\nIsland Stories with Paquito D'Rivera (Heads Up, 1997)\nNew Horizons (Concord Picante, 2000)\nParaiso with Dave Samuels, Dave Valentin, Steve Khan (Concord, 2001)\nThe Gathering   (Concord Picante, 2002)\nBirds of a Feather with Dave Samuels (Concord Picante, 2003)\nSchuur Fire, Diane Schuur with Caribbean Jazz Project (Concord Picante 2005)\nHere and Now: Live in Concert (Concord 2005)\nMosaic with Dave Samuels (Concord Picante, 2006)\nAfro Bop Alliance with Dave Samuels (Heads Up, 2008)\n\n\n== Members ==\nSources:\n\nOscar Feldman - alto and soprano saxophone\nAndy Axelrad – alto saxophone\nJohn Benitez – bass\nRandy Brecker – trumpet\nCafé – percussion\nCaridad Canelon – backing vocals\nOscar Castro-Neves – guitar\nLuis Conte – congas, bongos, timbales, percussion\nNick Cooper – trumpet\nDan Drew – trombone\nDario Eskenazi – piano\nRichie Flores – congas, bongos, shakere\nLuis Hernandez – tenor saxophone\nConrad Herwig – trombone\nRob Holmes – baritone saxophone\nChristian Howes – violin\nSteve Khan – guitar\nBoris Kozlov – bass\nRomero Lubambo – guitar\nAlain Mallet – piano, organ\nJoe McCarthy – drums\nJim McFalls – trombone\nMark Morgan – trombone\nMax Murray – bass\nAndy Narell – steel pans\nVince Norman – tenor saxophone\nBen Patterson – trombone\nDafnis Prieto – timbales, drums\nLuisito Quintero – timbales, percussion\nPaquito D'Rivera – alto saxophone, clarinet\nRuben Rodriguez – bass\nPoncho Sanchez – congas\nDave Samuels – marimba, vibraphone\nPernell Saturnino – congas, percussion\nOscar Stagnaro – bass\nTim Stanley – trumpet\nDiego Urcola – trumpet, flugelhorn\nDave Valentin – flute\nRay Vega – flugelhorn, trumpet\nRobert Vilera – timbales, percussion\nMark Walker – drums\nChris Walter – trumpet\nSteve Williams – alto saxophone\nAlon Yavnai – piano\n\n\n== References =="

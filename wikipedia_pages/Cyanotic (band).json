    "text": "Cyanotic is a Chicago-based industrial rock collective fronted by Sean Payne that formed in 2002 and released its first full-length album in 2005. Cyanotic is known for its genre-blending work, which fuses traditional industrial beats and vocals with drum n bass, sampling and heavy metal to create a hard, aggressive sound. The band's lyrics contain many tongue-in-cheek references to transhumanism.\n\n\n== History ==\nFronted by Sean Payne, the project has appeared throughout North America and the United Kingdom live with the likes of Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Meat Beat Manifesto, Chemlab, 16 Volt, Andrew W.K., Acumen Nation, DJ? Acucrack, Rabbit Junk and many more.\nSean Payne formed Cyanotic in 2002 and released the Mutual Bonding Through Violation demo EP in 2003 via their own Glitch Mode Recordings label. Transhuman was released in mid-2005, and was Cyanotic's first full-length album, featuring 12 tracks and co-production by Jason Novak of Acumen Nation / DJ? Acucrack. A two-disc deluxe edition, Transhuman 2.0, and the \"Hail the Glitch 2k6\" summer tour followed soon after. The double album features the original Transhuman, digitally remastered by Chris Cozort of iammynewt, as well a second disc featuring new songs, alternate mixes, bonus tracks and guest appearances from members of Front Line Assembly, 16 Volt, Acumen Nation, DJ? Acucrack, mindfluxFuneral and fellow Glitch Mode Recordings cohorts Rabbit Junk. Transhuman 2.0 saw its release via WTII Records and BitRiot Records in association with\nThe band's second full-length album, The Medication Generation saw release in summer 2010. Musically, the band continued to mature, and the partnership for co-producing with Acumen Nation's Jamie Duffy saw the band's song-writing and production improve. Since the release of The Medication Generation, Cyanotic has toured the United States multiple times in support of the release.\nCyanotic had done remixes and production work for several artists, including Chemlab, Front Line Assembly, 16 Volt, Acumen Nation, Pigface, 3Teeth, Author & Punisher. Sean Payne stayed active in producing Cyanotic, doing production work for others and maintaining multiple collaborations. Robohop saw Cyanotic and members of The Glitch Mode Squad collaborating with Chicago drill / hip hop artists to create a rough, glitchy and gritty industrial – hip hop release. \"Prime Directives, 1-4\" was met with positive reception, both within the Chicago hip-hop community and industrial scene.\n\"Worst Case Scenario\", released September 9, 2014, was the band's final release with guitarist, Chris H, as well as co-producer Jamie Duffy following his death in July 2012. The band continued to rotate a live and studio secondary role during this time. Cyanotic performed live at The Cold Waves music festival in 2012, in honor of Jamie Duffy and has since reappeared twice (2014, 2017). Worst Case Scenario, vol. 1 was met with positive reviews for its continued path through various industrial influences.\nIn 2016, Cyanotic and guitarist Chris H separated, but a live act of Jordan Davis (Relic) on synthesizers, Dan Dickerscheid (Relic) on drums and Kevin Barron transitioning from live and studio synthesizer player to bass continued to perform live without guitars. The band completed a North American tour with iVardensphere, and performances with Tim Skold (KMFDM, Marilyn Manson) as a four piece. This heavily influenced the fourth studio album, Tech Noir. Audiences found immediate differences in Tech Noir for its almost complete lack of guitars, but the album received critical praise for its ability to communicate aggression without requiring guitars to do so. Tech Noir was re-released in 2018 with seven new tracks as T2.\nIn 2019, Sean Payne was joined in-studio and on stage by Glitch Mode Recordings label mates CONFORMCO drummer Jesse Hunt and Nuclear*Sun's Tal Kliger on guitar and synths.\nOn May 12, 2022, Drew Rosander died from an apparent suicide by overdose, aged 37.\n\n\n== Line-up ==\n\n\n=== Studio ===\nSean Payne – vocals, electronics (2002–present)\nBrad Huston – guitars, additional electronics (2019–present)\nJesse Hunt – drums (2019–present)\nConnor Eck – bass, additional synths (2019–present)\n\n\n=== Live ===\nSean Payne: vocals, programming\nBrad Huston: guitars, additional synths\nJesse Hunt: drums, additional percussion\nConnor Eck: synth\nDavid Kultgen: visuals/projection\n\n\n=== Former & sessional ===\nDrew Rosander – guitars, synths (2002–2010, 2014, 2017)\nChris Hryniewiecki – guitars (2005–2015)\nKevin Barron – live bass, production/programming (2010–2019)\nJordan Davis – live electronics, vocals (2012–present)\nDan Dickerscheid – live drums (2016–present)\nBrian Blake – bass (2002–2007)\nJairus Khan – additional programming (2005–2007)\nTom Hutchinson – live synths (2005–2007)\nOndrea Clarkson – live synths (2008)\nG.

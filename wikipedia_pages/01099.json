    "text": "01099 (German: [nʊl tseːn nɔyn ʊnt ˈnɔyntsɪç], i.e. zero ten ninety-nine) is a German rap group from Dresden. The name refers to the postal code of Äußere Neustadt (01099), the area of the city the rappers are from.\nThe group consists of four members: Dani, Gustav, Paul and Zachi.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe four members found each other partly as orchestra musicians and attended the St. Benno highschool together. They also knew each other before their highschool days, but they only formed as 01099 in 2018.\nIn autumn of 2019, they released their debut EP Skyr. The title is based on the Icelandic curd of the same name; the song can be understood as both an ode to curd and a parody of current hip-hop culture. According to the band themselves, the group understood their music at the time more as a parody and fun project.\nIn 2020, their debut album Morgensonne was released. On this album, the musicians somewhat distanced themselves from the parodic approach and tried their hand at being rappers who primarily want to convey an attitude to life. Accordingly, the album is also somewhat melancholic. Shortly after the release of the album, the group split up and the four members moved to different cities to study. Soon after this, however, Paul, Zachi and Gustav returned as the three main members of the group; in an interview with World Wide Wohnzimmer, Paul stated that he had given up his music studies after only two weeks in order to pursue a musical career. Dani, while still officially part of the group, has taken a back seat due to his formal horn studies.\n01099 gained further popularity through the single Frisch, which was released in December 2020, and through this were able to reach a wider audience, especially via the platform TikTok. On March 26, 2021, Frisch entered the German singles chart at number 78 and peaked at number 36. The crew was signed by Groove Attack in 2021.\nOn May 14, 2021, 01099 released their single Durstlöscher. This, like Frisch, is part of the EP Dachfenster which was released on July 2, 2021. In November 2021, the band completed their first tour, which was limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Another tour for the album Altbau followed in April 2022.\nSince the release of Frisch and Durstlöscher, the singles have amassed 7 million and 9.5 million views on YouTube, and 125.5 million and 125 million streams on the streaming platform Spotify (as of 24 October 2024).\nAfter the pandemic, 01099 played at the following festivals in 2022:\n\nSuperbloom 2022, dated September 3–4\nHeroes Festival 2022, dated September 9–10\nDockville 2022, dated August 19–21\nFM 4 Frequency Festival 2022, dated August 17–20\nSzene Open Air 2022, dated August 4–6\nSplash!

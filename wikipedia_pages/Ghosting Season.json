They also operate a small recording label, \"This is It Forever\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was started in early 2011 by Gavin Miller and Thomas Ragsdale, and was originally a spin off from the electronic group worriedaboutsatan, and plays similar music but with rhythms more suitable for dancing. The band initially self-released two EPs: 'Far End Of The Graveyard', and the  'Far End Of The Graveyard Remixes'.\nTheir debut album, 'The Very Last Of The Saints' was released in 2012 by Last Night On Earth, the imprint started by Sasha, to a generally positive critical response.\nThe singles 'Far End Of The Graveyard' and 'A Muffled Sound Of Voices' brought the band to a larger audience thanks to radio airplay. XFM DJ Mary Anne Hobbs later featured a guest mix from the band on her Saturday evening show\nThe band are particularly known for their live shows, as they use a mixture of more traditional instrumentation such as guitars and vocals, with electronic elements like laptops and Roland SPD-S drum pads.\nIn 2013, the band toured the UK, including a performance at the \"Sounds from the Other City\" concert in Salford.\nIn 2014, the band released a library of sound samples that it had created.\n\n\n== References =="

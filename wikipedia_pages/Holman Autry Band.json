The band has had the pleasure of playing venues all over the States of Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Florida and are always welcome where they perform. The band consists of 4 self-taught musicians. Brodye Brooks (Lead Guitar and Vocals), Casey King (Vocals and Bass Guitar), Josh Walker (Vocals and Rhythm Guitar), Brandon Myers (Drums) They had late night jam sessions as teenagers and complement each other in such a way that can only be present through learning to play together.\n\n\n== Sounds ==\nHolman Autry Band has a very distinct sound. This makes categorization into a particular genre very difficult. Holman Autry Band would most often fall into the Southern rock to Country rock category. However, Holman Autry Band and their fans prefer to consider their genre a new type of country music entitled “Black Label Country.” Some of their songs depict the “I’m not taking it anymore” attitude with songs like “Calling You Out” and “By Any Other Name.”  Holman Autry Band will also show you their exceptional musical talent with “Fruition”, along with their love for music with “Glory Days.”  They will also display fun-loving songs such as “Whiskey Wagon” and “Dark Haired Woman.”  With songs such as “Wildest Dreams,” “Summer Day” and “This One’s for you”, they will show their sensitive side as well; the latter being a tribute to their fans.\nHolman Autry Band is known for the way they do cover songs. They will take a song, no matter how popular or unpopular, and revive it. Exceptional cover songs such as the Allman Brothers’ “Midnight Rider” and \"Come and Go Blues” and David Allan Coe’s “The Ride” make it difficult to hear the song played in its original form after hearing it played with the incomparable stylings of the Holman Autry Band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHolman Autry Band (Self Titled)\nTracks\n1.

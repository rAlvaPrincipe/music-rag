Their debut studio album, Appetite for Disctruction, followed in 2000.\nIn 2004, the duo released a studio album, Disconnected. The music video for \"Chopping Heads\", directed by Keep Adding and Scott Pagano, was selected for the International Critic's Week at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.\nIn 2005, the duo released The Return to the Acid Planet, which consisted of remixes of old tracks they discovered while cleaning their studio.\nIn 2006, a statement was published on funkstorung.com, stating that the duo had officially broken up due to musical, personal and practical differences.

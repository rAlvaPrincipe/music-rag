    "text": "Heimatærde is a German electro-industrial band with a medieval motif. It was created as a studio project by Disc jockey Ashlar von Megalon (DJ Ash) in 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\nHeimatærde was founded in 2004, as a studio project by German DJ Ashlar von Megalon. After the first EP Ich hab die Nacht getræumet (tr. I Have Dreamed the Night), released in the same year by Infacted Recordings, the first album 'Gotteskrieger' was released in 2005. Outside Germany it is released from Metropolis Records. In the beginning, DJ Ash avoided acting on stage, because music should be in the fore.\nThe first performance of Heimatærde was 2007 at Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig. In January 2018, the new drummer, Brother Henry of Kent, was introduced. He has supported the band live before.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\tHeimatærde, Line-up live at Nocturnal Culture Night 2018 in Deutzen\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial site\nConcert history\n\n\n== Sources =="

The duo signed in 1993 to Paris's record label, Scarface Records, after passing him a demo tape at a club.  They released their first studio album, Ear to the Street.\nThe single and video release of their 1994 single,  \"Somethin' to Ride To (Fonky Expedition)\", helped TCD gain national recognition.  Soon after, they were signed by Priority/EMI Records and released their second album, Gamers. Many collaborations, projects and television appearances followed, most notably Rap City, MTV Jams, and Soul Train.\n\nTheir third album, The Nutcracker Suite, was released on Guerrilla Funk Records on February 10, 2009. In 2010, TCD severed their relationship with Guerrilla Funk Records, and in 2011 they signed a distribution deal with Phaseone/Sony.\nOn December 10, 2011, Smith was found dead at her home.  Initially, the cause of death was unknown, but it was eventually determined to be from complications associated with blood clots that reached her lungs.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nEar to the Street (1993)\nGamers (1996)\nThe Nutcracker Suite (2009)\n\n\n=== Solo projects ===\nCMG - The Jane of All Trades (2011)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Somethin' to Ride To (Fonky Expedition)\" (1993)\n\"We Roll Deep\" (1993)\n\"Sticky Situation\" (1993)\n\"Gamers\" (1996)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Conscious Daughters at AllMusic\nConscious Daughters | Hip Hop from Oakland, CA\nM.I.S.S.

    "text": "JBJ (Korean: 제이비제이) was a South Korean boy band consisting of six members who previously participated in Mnet's 2017 survival show Produce 101 Season 2. The group was managed by Fave Entertainment, while CJ E&M oversaw the group's release production. They officially debuted on October 18, 2017. They held their final concert on April 22, 2018, and disbanded on April 30, 2018.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut ===\nProduce 101 Season 2 premiered on Mnet in April 2017, where 101 male trainees from various South Korean entertainment companies competed to debut in an 11-member boy group that would promote exclusively for a year and a half under YMC Entertainment. The show ended on June 16, forming the project group Wanna One. On the same day, the show's fans had named Kenta Takada of Star Road Entertainment, Jin Longguo of Choon Entertainment, Kim Sang-gyun of Hunus Entertainment, and Kim Tae-dong of The Vibe Label (later known as Major Nine), as eliminated trainees whom they would like to debut together as a project group equivalent to Produce 101's I.B.I. The fans tentatively named the group \"JBJ\", which stands for the Korean phrase 정말 바람직한 조합, meaning \"A Really Desirable Combination\", and \"Just Be Joyful\". Later on, Roh Tae-hyun of Ardor & Able (later known as Star Crew Entertainment), Kim Dong-han of Oui Entertainment, and Kwon Hyun-bin of YGKPlus were soon added into the fan-imagined group after the Instagram photo that Taehyun posted had received positive feedback from fans.\nDiscussions to officially form and debut JBJ began around early July 2017 between the seven tentative members and their respective agencies. CJ E&M and LOEN Entertainment also participated in the discussions as the intended management companies of the group's releases and activities, respectively. Fave Entertainment, LOEN Entertainment's in-house label, was tasked to be the group's official agency. On July 25, the trainees and the companies had reached an agreement. It was reported that the group's contract would last seven months, but LOEN Entertainment expressed that they are open for any discussions to extend the group's contract. JBJ was tentatively scheduled for debut on September 10 with all seven members, but was later confirmed for debut on October 18 without Kim Tae-dong.\nKim Tae-dong's participation in the group was not confirmed because of an ongoing conflict with his agency, The Vibe Label.

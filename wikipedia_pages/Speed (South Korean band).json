The group was formerly Coed School's male unit until they became an independent group in 2013. In late 2015,  MBK Entertainment removed their profile page from the official website and it was reported that the group was disbanded.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2011–2012: Formation and debut ===\n\nIn 2011, Core Contents Media announced that they would be dividing Co-Ed School into two sub-units.

    "text": "Tha Alkaholiks, also known as Tha Liks, is an American hip hop trio from Los Angeles, California, United States. \nSince the early 1990s they have produced party music with a hardcore hip hop edge, powered by the beats of DJ and producer E-Swift (born Eric Brooks in Columbus, Georgia, raised in Toledo, Ohio) and the rhymes of J-Ro (born James Robinson in Los Angeles) and Tash (born Rico Smith in Cincinnati). \nThough commercial crossover success largely eluded the group, they maintained a dedicated following on their native West Coast, throughout the United States and worldwide. Three songs of Tha Alkaholiks were also featured on Loud Rocks.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n21 & Over (1993)\nCoast II Coast (1995)\nLikwidation (1997)\nX.O.

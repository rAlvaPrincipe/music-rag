In September 2012, they released the remix album Piercing the Quiet Remixed, which landed in the top 5 on the iTunes dance albums chart.\nAfter 100 episodes of their radio show Air Up There, they ended it with a sold out, live performance in their hometown of Austin, Texas. A new program called Tritonia aired on Sirius XM Electric Area, but now broadcasts Monday and Wednesday evenings from 11pm to midnight EST on Sirius XM BPM channel 51.\nIn 2013, Tritonal switched their style from trance to house, which was reflected in their 2013 and 2014 EP series entitled Metamorphic.

Also on April 16, 2013, Tritonal announced via social media that they would be joining Will Holland as co-owners and directors of Enhanced Music.

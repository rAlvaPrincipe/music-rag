    "text": "Envy is a Japanese rock band formed in Tokyo, in 1992. They are signed to Rock Action Records in Europe and Temporary Residence Limited in North America, though originally they worked with Level Plane Records. Initially influential in the post-hardcore and screamo scenes, Envy soon began to employ elements of post-rock in their work as well.\nThey have released 7 studio albums to date (with the most recent being Eunoia), as well as several EPs and splits, most notably with Jesu and American post-hardcore band Thursday. Original member and vocalist Tetsuya Fukagawa left Envy in 2016.\nOn February 6, 2018, Envy announced a new lineup consisting of Tsuyoshi Yoshitake, Yoshimitsu Taki, and Hiroki Watanabe. A Japanese press release added that two members had left the band, and founding guitarist and drummer Masahiro Tobita and Dairoku Seki were no longer listed as members on the band's Facebook page or website.\nOn April 1, 2018, Tetsuya Fukagawa surprise-rejoined Envy on stage for the first time in two and a half years, cementing his return to the band. This was subsequently confirmed via the band's official social media pages.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nFrom Here to Eternity (1998)\nAll the Footprints You've Ever Left and the Fear Expecting Ahead (2001)\nA Dead Sinking Story (2003)\nInsomniac Doze (2006)\nRecitation (2010)\nAtheist's Cornea (2015)\nThe Fallen Crimson (2020)\nEunoia (2024)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nBreathing and Dying in This Place (1996)\nAngel's Curse Whispered in the Edge of Despair (1999)\nThe Eyes of Single Eared Prophet (2000)\nBurning Out the Memories 10\" (2000)\nAbyssal (2007)\nAlnair in August (2018)\nDefinition of Impossibility (2019)\nSeimei (2022)\n\n\n=== Splits ===\nSplit 7\" with Sixpence (1997)\nSplit 7\" with Endeavor (1997)\nSplit 7\" with This Machine Kills (2000)\nSplit 10\" with Iscariote (2002)\nSplit CD with Yaphet Kotto and This Machine Kills (2003)\n\"Envy/Jesu\" (2008)\n\"Thursday / Envy\" (2008)\n\n\n=== 7\"s ===\nEyes of Final Proof (2000)\nLast Wish (2001)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"As Serenity Calls Your Name\" (2011)\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\nTransfovista DVD (2007)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nCompiled Fragments 1997-2003 (2005)\nInvariable Will, Recurring Ebbs and Flows (2013)\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent\nNobukata Kawai — guitar (1992–present)\nManabu Nakagawa — bass (1992–present)\nTetsuya Fukagawa — vocals, programming (1992-2016, 2018–present)\nTsuyoshi \"Yoshi\" Yoshitake — guitar (2018–present)\nYoshimitsu Taki — guitar (2018–present)\nHiroki Watanabe — drums (2018–present)\nPast\nMasahiro Tobita — guitar (1992–2018)\nDairoku Seki — drums (1992–2018)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nEnvy on Facebook\nEnvy on Instagram"

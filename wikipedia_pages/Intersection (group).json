    "text": "Intersection (stylized INTERSECTION) was a Japanese boy band formed by Avex in 2018. They disbanded on March 31, 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\nAvex created Intersection's concept in 2015 after scouting the members, forming the group on the basis of the group's members having mixed ancestry in an attempt to break into the international music market. Prior to debuting, Kazuma Mitchell was an exclusive model for Men's Non-no and a student at Harvard University, while William Aoyama was a Junior Olympic swimmer.\nIn October 2018, they released their digital debut single, \"Heart of Gold\", followed by \"Falling\" in November 2018, \"Body Language\" in December 2018, and \"You're the Reason\" in July 2019. In July 2019, Intersection was announced as the performer of the ending theme song to the 2019 anime adaptation of Fruits Basket with the song \"One Step Closer.\" Later, on August 21, 2019, they released their first album, Intersection, digitally, with the song \"You're the Reason\" as the promotional track. In January 2020, they were announced as the performers of the ending theme song to the third season of Black Clover with the song \"New Page.\"\nIn 2021, Kazuma, Caelan, and Mika participated in the Chinese reality survival program Produce Camp 2021.

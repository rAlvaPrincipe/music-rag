    "text": "Yat-Kha is a band from Tuva, led by vocalist/guitarist Albert Kuvezin. Their music is a mixture of Tuvan traditional music and rock, featuring Kuvezin's distinctive kargyraa throat singing style, the kanzat kargyraa.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nYat-Kha was founded in Moscow in 1991, as a collaborative project between Kuvezin and Russian avant-garde, electronic composer Ivan Sokolovsky. The project blended traditional Tuvan folk music with post-modern rhythms and electronic effects. Kuvezin and Sokolovsky toured and played festivals, and eventually took the name \"Yat-Kha\", which refers to a type of small, Central Asian zither similar to the Mongolian yatga and the Chinese guzheng, which Kuvezin plays in addition to the guitar. In 1993, they released a self-titled album on the General Records label.\nSince July 21 2001, they have been performing a live soundtrack to Vsevolod Pudovkin's 1928 silent film Storm Over Asia.\nTheir 1995 song \"Karangailyg Kara Hovaa (Dyngyldai)\" is featured in the Apple iPhone 15 \"Titanium\" commercial.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nAlbums:\n\nPriznak Gryadushchei Byedy (1991)\nKhanparty (1992)\nYat-Kha (1993)\nYenisei Punk (1995)\nTundra's Ghosts (1996/97) - remastered version of Yat-Kha released by Ivan Sokolovsky)\nDalai Beldiri (1999)\nAldyn Dashka (2000)\nBootleg (2001, live)\ntuva.rock (2003)\nRe-Covers (2005)\nBootleg 2005 (2005, live)\nPoets and Lighthouses (2010)\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nAlbert Kuvezin (vocals, Throat singing, Guitar, Bass guitar, Chanzy, Khomus, Yat-Kha)\nSholban Mongush (igil, vocal)\n\"Theodore Scipio\" (Bass guitar)\n\n\n=== Past ===\nEvgeny \"Zhenya\" Tkachov (drums, Percussion)\nRadik Tiuliush (vocals, Throat Singing, Morin Khuur, Igil)\nSailyk Ommun (vocals, Yat-Kha)\nMakhmud Skripaltschchikov (Bass guitar)\nAldyn-ool Sevek (vocals, Throat singing, Morin Khuur, Igil)\nAlexei Saaia (vocals, Morin khuur, Bass guitar)\nIvan Sokolovsky (Synthesizers, Percussion)\n\n\n=== Appearing on Poets and Lighthouses with Albert Kuvezin (Voice, Acoustic Guitar) ===\nSimon Edwards (Acoustic Bass guitar, Double Bass, Marimbula, Mbira, Appalachian Dulcimer)\nGiles Perring (Acoustic Guitar, Piano, Harmonium, Backing Vocals, Drums, Percussion)\nSarah Homer (Clarinet, Bass Clarinet, Recorder)\nMelanie Pappenheim (Backing Vocals)\nLu Edmonds (Cumbus)\nNeil Cameron (Scottish Small Pipes)\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1991 recognized by Brian Eno, one of the international judges at the first Voices of Asia Festival in Almaty, Kazakhstan\n1995 French RFI \"Decouvertes Est\" prize for Yenisei Punk\n1999 German Critic's Prize for Dalai Beldiri\n2002 BBC Radio 3 \"Award for World Music\"\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Russian site\nYat-Kha discography at Discogs\nYat-Kha discography at MusicBrainz\nIvan Sokolovsky\nReality Film: Storm over Asia\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Kukeiha Club (矩形波倶楽部, kukeiha kurabu, lit. \"Square Wave Club\", referring to the company's logo featuring two sharp-cornered waves), stylized as KuKeiHa CLUB, is a band that was formed by Motoaki Furukawa, a composer, arranger, and producer working for the game firm Konami, after his work on Gradius III back in 1990. It is often confused with コナミ矩形波倶楽部 (Konami Kukeiha Club), Konami's team of composers (music in Konami games are credited to Konami Kukeiha Club, not Kukeiha Club). It consists of members from Konami's music production department, mirroring similar bands at the time from other game companies such as Capcom's Alph Lyla and Sega's S.S.T. Band. The band has two \"original\" albums: A self-titled back in 1990 featuring five original songs and five cover tracks and a second album entitled Hope featuring 10 original tracks. In a few rare cases, other members of Kukeiha Club are known to perform live (such as in the 1991 Konami All Stars: The Sentryp-Bako Heisei 4 Nen Ban album). However, they are credited as \"Konami Kukeiha Club\".\n\n\n== Initial members ==\nJun Funahashi: keyboards\nMotoaki Furukawa: guitar, arrangement\nYukie Morimoto\n\n\n== Primary members ==\nMami Asano : Keyboards\nMotoaki Furukawa: All Guitars & Programming\nTappy (Tappi Iwase): Drums & Percussion\n\n\n== Guest musicians ==\nAkira Jimbo: drums (Kukeiha Club)\nKenichi Mitsuda: keyboards\nKenichiro Fukui: synthesizer (Hope / Kukeiha Club)\nKoichi Namiki: guitar (Kukeiha Club pro-fusion: Tokimeki Memorial)\nToyoyuki Tanaka: bass (Kukeiha Club pro-fusion: Salamander)\nMasato Honda: saxophone\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n古川もとあきStation: Motoaki Furukawa Official Web Site\nTappy Iwase Official Site"

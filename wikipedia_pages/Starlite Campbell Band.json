    "text": "Starlite & Campbell is a group based in Portugal. Formed in 2016, the band is led by married couple Suzy Starlite and Simon Campbell. Their debut album, Blueberry Pie was nominated for a European Blues Award in November 2017 and blends British blues, British rock, blues and British folk.\nIn 2023, following the transition album ‘’The Language of Curiosity’’ they decided to change musical direction and launched the multimedia, Art Rock project Starlite.One. Simultaneously, the band name was changed from the Starlite Campbell Band to Starlite & Campbell reflecting the new direction.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe duo had been recording, playing and touring independently in bands for many years until they met in 2012, when Starlite asked Campbell, who was British Blues Awards Nominee, to join her band as the guitar player. The love extended past each other's playing and the duo were wed in 2014 after a whirlwind romance, forming their new joint band, Starlite Campbell, in January 2016.\nAs prolific singer-songwriters, they started writing together immediately and built up a large collection of songs in a variety of styles, from Americana, folk music, electronic music, progressive rock to British blues. The art of the song is everything and they fly in the face of disposable music – writing, recording and producing their work and then releasing on their independent label Supertone Records.\nTheir first recorded collaboration was on Campbell's second solo album, The Knife where they jointly wrote and performed Do You Want Me with Campbell on acoustic guitar, Theremin and vocals and Starlite on Mellotron and vocals.\nStarlite is a regular contributor to Bass Musician.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\n\n\n=== Blueberry Pie ===\nThe couple wrote the material for their debut album Blueberry Pie over two weeks in April 2016 and started recording in July at the Supertone Records Studio in Valencia, Spain, with the album mixed and mastered in October 2016. It was produced and engineered by Campbell, co-produced by Starlite and mastered by Jon Astley who is known for his work with The Who and other rock luminaries. In addition to the band and session musicians Steve Gibson and Jonny Henderson, Valencian native Danny Boy Sanchez was co opted to play harmonica on track No. 5, \"Say What You Want\".\nThe album artwork is based on a picture taken by Starlite in the late 70's of her Grandmother Betty Higgs.\nBlueberry Pie was released on 1 February 2017 and has been extensively reviewed by publications in the UK, Europe, USA and Australia Blues Matters!, R2 (Rock'n'Reel), Classic Rock\nThe band made a festive release It Started Raining on 24 December 2017. The song was recorded live at Supertone Records studio in Valencia, Spain as part of the 'Blueberry Pie' sessions with a single guitar overdub. The cover image was taken by Isle of Man-based photographer Phil Kneen and features an old caravan featured in the song's lyric.\nOn 12 November 2018 the band simultaneously released their new single Heart of Stone along with a limited edition, gatefold, 180g double phonograph record (vinyl) of their album Blueberry Pie. The lacquers were cut by Miles Showell at Abbey Road Studios and the pressing supported by the Isle of Man Arts Council.\nRecorded as part of the original Blueberry Pie sessions, the track has a stinging, acidic lyric that complements the track's hypnotic rolling groove. It appears exclusively in physical form on side four of the record. The cover image was taken by Isle of Man-based photographer Phil Kneen featuring actor Rob Smith.\n\n\n=== The Language of Curiosity ===\nIn May 2019 Starlite and Campbell relocated their Supertone Records studio into the countryside near Hanover, Germany, where they started recording their second British blues / British rock music album, The Language of Curiosity moving again in October 2020 to Lisbon, Portugal where they continue work on the recordings. Five singles have been released from the album which was made its debut on November 5, 2021 and has been extensively reviewed by publications in the UK, Europe, USA and Australia including Blues Matters!, R2 (Rock'n'Reel), Classic Rock\nAgain, it is produced and engineered by Campbell, co-produced by Starlite and mastered by Astley. In addition to the band and session musicians Steve Gibson (drums), Gabriele De Vecchio (Grand / upright Piano, Wurlitzer and Hammond organ) and Jonny Henderson (Hammond Organ, Wurlitzer Electric piano, Vox Continental, Hohner Clavinet and Bechstein grand piano). Some of Henderson's keyboard parts were recorded at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, Wales. The cover photograph was taken by award-winning photographer Stuart Bebb depicting dancing in the streets of Oxford following the relaxation of the COVID-19 restrictions in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n=== Starlite Campbell Band Live! ===\nDuring the course of the band's career, several live recordings were made and in 2022 eight tracks were mixed and released digitally and on Compact Disc. The album features highly improvised and extended versions of tracks from Campbell's solo album ThirtySix plus the bands Language of Curiosity, Blueberry Pie and Procol Harum's A Whiter Shade Of Pale which was released as a single in June 2022. The album has attracted excellent reviews.\nThe band digitally released the accompanying album Starlite Campbell Band Live! 2 in October 2022.\n\n\n=== Starlite.One - the album ===\nIn July 2023 the couple completed recording an Art Rock album Starlite.One, which fuses electronic elements with traditional instrumentation.

    "text": "Agora Fidelio was a French alternative rock band (sometimes referred to as post rock).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in the late 1990s in the form of side-project of Psykup.\nThe band interprets simple acoustic covers.\nAfter some changes, the line up is stabilized in 2002. Mathieu MIEGEVILLE, vocals, is no longer the only member of the initial training. He also officiates since 2007 in My Own Private Alaska, a piano trio / battery / screams. Mathieu Sainty, said Akira, who takes the bass, was also a member of the Seaside Group. Julian Rouche, guitar, is a founding member of the Naive group, which released his first album in June 2009. He is also the only member of the electro Status Phantom project.\nIn 2002, the band released their first album Une histoire de chair.\nThe second album Altitude Zéro, was released in 2004.\nThe third album, Le troisième choix, was initially scheduled for February 2006, but was released 10 months later, in November 2006. To ward off the spell, the group released a 4 track EP called Finir à Paris. This EP offers two pieces of the future album, two remixes from Altitude Zero, and clip Finish in Paris.\nIn early 2007, Akira decided to leave band. He was replaced by Stéphane Bezzina (called Pelo and current bassist Psykup).\nThe band's fourth album Les Illusions d'une Route was structured as a triple album triptych.\nThe first issue Barcelone (lit. 'Barcelona'), was released in 2010, and the second issue Bagdad (lit. 'Baghdad') in 2012.\nThe band name has no special meaning. This is the concatenation of Agora is the name of the former studio of Psykup, Agora (managed by Yannick Tournier, former Psykup), who was also a place of life and meetings, and Fidelio, which is the Password orgiastic evening in the film Eyes Wide Shut (originally the name of the only opera Beethoven).\n\n\n== Members ==\nMatthieu Miègeville (aka MiLKa) : Vocals, ( Also vocalist of Psykup and My Own Private Alaska)\nJulien Rouche (aka Jouch) : Guitar ( Also singer and guitarist of Naïve)\nStéphane Bezzina (aka Pelo) : Bass ( Substitute of Akira, since February 2007) - Pelo also is bass in Psykup\nPierre-Marie Lesouple (aka Pim) : Drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nUne histoire de chair (2002)\nAltitude Zéro (2004)\nFinir à Paris (EP) (2006)\nLe troisième choix (2006)\nLes Illusions d'une Route : Barcelone (2010)\nLes Illusions d'une Route : Bagdad (2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nOfficial record label Archived 2008-11-20 at the Wayback Machine\nAudio interview about the launch of \"le Troisième choix\""

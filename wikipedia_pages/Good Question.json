Their only chart hit came in 1988, when they hit number one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart with \"Got a New Love\".  The song also reached the R&B and pop charts in the U.S., where it peaked at numbers 51 and 86, respectively. Another single, \"Listen to Your Heart\", and its self-titled album were released the same year on Prince's record label Paisley Park Records.\nThey have since re-grouped and currently perform in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1988: Good Question (Paisley Park Records)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one dance hits (United States)\nList of artists who reached number one on the U.S. dance chart\n\n\n== References =="

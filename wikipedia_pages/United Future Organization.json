    "text": "United Future Organization (also known as UFO) is a nu-jazz trio made up of Japanese-born Tadashi Yabe (矢部 直, Yabe Tadashi), Toshio Matsuura (松浦 俊夫, Matsuura Toshio) and Frenchman Raphael Sebbag (ラファエル セバーグ).  In 1994, the group appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation album, Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool.  The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African-American community, was heralded as \"Album of the Year\" by Time Magazine. One of the three original founding members, Toshio Matsuura, left the group in 2002 to work with Universal Japan on a remix album project. Yabe Tadashi died on 25 July 2024, at the age of 59.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nUnited Future Organization (Brownswood, 1993)\nNo Sound Is Too Taboo (Talkin' Loud, 1994)\n3rd Perspective (Talkin' Loud/Brownswood, 1996)\nBon Voyage (Brownswood, 1999)\nV(five) (Exceptional, 2001)\n\n\n=== Remix albums ===\nRemix (Brownswood, 1995)\nSpicy Remix (Brownswood, 1997)\nBon Voyage Les Remix (Brownswood, 2000)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nJazzin '91 - '92' (99, 1992)\nNow & Then: Years Of Lightning, Day Of Drums 1990-1997 (Brownswood, 1997)\nTres Amigos – This is Smooth Jazz, Vol. 3 (2001)\nSummertime (Remix) – Verve//Remixed (2002)\nGood Luck Shore (Joujouka TFPP Mix) – Mad Skipper Singles, Vol. 3 (2006)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"I Love My Baby (My Baby Loves Jazz)\" (1991)\n\"Loud Minority\" (1992)\n\"Insomnie\" (1992)\n\"United Future Airlines\" (1995)\n\"Cosmic Gypcy\" (1995)\n\"Flying Saucer\" (1999)\n\"Somewhere/Labyrinth\" (1999)\n\"Good Luck Shore\" (1999)\n\"Tres Amigos\" (1999)\n\"Listen Love\" (2002)\n\"Transworld\" (2002)\n\n\n=== Others ===\n\"Upa Neguinho (Supa Neg Mix)\" in V.A., Multidirection (Brownswood, 1993)[2LP]\n\"Stolen Moments\" in V.A., Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool (Impulse!, 1994)\nThe Planet Plan\nUFOs for Real Scene1 (2006)\nUFOs for Real Scene2 (2006)\nUFOs for Real Scene3 (2006)\nRebirth of the Cool – A Deeper Shade of Blues (1992)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUnited Future Organization – official site\nUnited Future Organization discography at Discogs \nUnited Future Organization DJ schedule\nTadashi Yabe at IMDb"

    "text": "Fol Chen is an American electronic band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2009. The band is signed to Asthmatic Kitty Records and has released three full-length albums.\n\n\n== Part I: John Shade, Your Fortune's Made ==\nThe band \"maintained utmost secrecy from the start\", working under aliases and disguising their faces during recorded shows, including KCRW radio's Morning Becomes Eclectic program and the 2009 South by Southwest festival.\nThe cover art for their first album, Part I: John Shade, Your Fortune's Made, release in 2009, features silhouettes, and music videos replace band members with actors and animation, such as the video of the song \"No Wedding Cake\" where band members appear as animals.\n\n\n== Part II: The New December ==\nIn 2010, the band released Part II: The New December, described by the Los Angeles Times as \"screwball pastiche pop [that] sounds like an algebra problem but feels like a come-on.\" Sinosa Loa joined the group at this time as keyboardist and vocalist, although the band favored group vocals and shared lead duties among most members. They toured throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe with other American bands, including Liars, !!!, and The Apples in Stereo.\n\n\n== The False Alarms (2013) ==\nThe band's third album was released March 19, 2013, on the Asthmatic Kitty label.  The music is in a style the band calls \"Opera-House\", which they describe as \"beat-driven electronica with grand, operatic gestures and lyrically-dense storytelling.\" In a departure from their previous use of multiple lead singers, Loa performs all ten tracks.\n\n\n== Other projects ==\nDuring a month-long residency at The Echo nightclub in Los Angeles, the band featured different shows each night –  one show invited guest singers found via Craigslist to perform with the band as a sort of live karaoke; another night saw metal band Viscera playing exclusively Fol Chen covers.\nIn November 2010, Goldman and Loa traveled to Saint Petersburg, Russia, to perform two long-form, constructivist-inspired reworkings of the two studio albums, followed by a workshop and recording session where they invited local musicians (and curious non-musicians) to join them in building a new Fol Chen song.\nOn July 28, 2011, Goldman and Loa held a workshop at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis to introduce the Fol Chen Verbal Algorithm Composer-Free Song Generator, produced with the Los Angeles–based arts organization Machine Project. The project allowed museum visitors to record their experience with a piece of art and have it converted into a song that they could take home.\nThe band collaborated with Monome, a computer-manufacturing company, in late 2011 to make the Tetrafol, a motion-sensitive pyramidal sound device. The Tetrafol came pre-loaded with Fol Chen samples but allowed users to apply their own sounds. The band released two singles made with the device and sold a limited run of 100 units.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Covers, remixes and collaborations ===\n\n\n=== Other contributions ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Asthmatic Kitty Records artists\nList of bands from Los Angeles\nList of synthpop artists\nMusic of Los Angeles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\ncargocollective.com/folchen, the band's official website\nFol Chen at AllMusic\nSXSW 2009 interview (video)"

    "text": "Modeselektor is a German electronic music duo consisting of Gernot Bronsert and Sebastian Szary.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group members met in 1992 in Berlin with group member Szary performing live acid house music at illegal underground parties, under the moniker Fundamental Knowledge. The group says, \"After the Wall came down, everywhere in Germany and especially East Germany there was a lot of chaos, anarchy.\" Both soon joined forces and began creating music as Modeselektor, a name taken from a function on the Roland Space Echo analog delay effects unit.\nIn 1999 Modeselektor signed its first remix contract and began working with Pfadfinderei, a Berlin-based VJ and design collective. In 2000 Modeselektor met Ellen Allien, making BPitch Control their home label. Modeselektor has also been involved in collaborative efforts; Moderat - a musical collaboration between Modeselektor and Apparat, Pfadselektor - a music/visual collaboration between Modeselektor and Pfadfinderei, and with Rhythm & Sound's Paul St. Hillaire. They have produced sound installations at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and lectured at the Merz Akademie in Stuttgart.\n\nModeselektor is a favourite group of Thom Yorke (frontman of Radiohead), who has recommended their albums in interviews and included the song \"Silikon\" (from their 2005 LP Hello Mom! and featuring vocalist Sasha Perera) in a publicly available iTunes playlist. Moderat (the collaboration between Modeselektor and Apparat) has also supported Radiohead on the band's concerts in Poznań, Poland and Prague, Czech Republic, in August 2009.\nThe follow-up to Hello Mom! was Happy Birthday!, which was released in 2007 with Paul St. Hilaire, TTC, Puppetmastaz,  Thom Yorke and Maxïmo Park as guest vocalists. Other collaborators included Otto von Schirach, Siriusmo, and Apparat. In an interview that same year, the group said regarding their sound: \"Happy metal, hard rap, country-ambient, Russian crunk. We don’t like it if people tag us as being a certain style or school or scene or whatever. We don’t really care about all that.\"\nIn March 2009, they released an album with Apparat under the name Moderat. They have collaborated previously on an EP named Auf Kosten der Gesundheit which was released as a limited 12\" on BPitch Control in 2002.\nModeselektor also appeared as the main characters in Amy Grill's 2009 electronic music documentary, Speaking in Code.\nModeselektor are said to be good friends with Siriusmo, and regularly remix and promote his material.\nIn September 2011 Modeselektor released their third LP, Monkeytown, in which various artists including Thom Yorke collaborated on. \nIn August 2013, Modeselektor released their second album in collaboration with Apparat under the name Moderat, entitled II. \nIn 2013, Modeselektor's label Monkeytown Records and Telekom Electronic Beats produced the documentary \"We Are Modeselektor\".\nIn March 2016, Modeselektor released their third album in collaboration with Apparat under the name Moderat, entitled III. \nIn April 2021, Modeselektor released their fourth LP, Extended. \nIn February 2022, a book on Modeselektor's album Happy Birthday! was published by Sean Nye for the 33 1/3 Europe series.\nIn May 2022, Modeselektor released their fourth album in collaboration with Apparat under the name Moderat, entitled More D4ta.\n\n\n== Monkeytown Records ==\nMonkeytown Records is a Berlin-based electronic music record label, owned by Sebastian Szary and Gernot Bronsert of Modeselektor.

    "text": "Brother Beyond were a British pop band who had success in the pop rock genre in the late 1980s.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nThe group's first four singles, \"I Should Have Lied\", \"How Many Times\", \"Chain-Gang Smile\" (produced by Don Was), and an early version of \"Can You Keep a Secret?\", were written by band members Eg White, and David Ben White in collaboration with Carl Fysh. The songs were also performed together by the band members, led by vocalist Nathan Moore. These early singles, released between 1986 and 1988, were minor chart successes in the UK Singles Chart.\nWhen the songwriters and producers Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman, known as Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW), auctioned off their services to charity, Brother Beyond and label EMI won the auction. The first song to be released from this session was \"The Harder I Try\", a UK No. 2 hit. The song was succeeded by the song \"He Ain't No Competition\", getting to No. 6 in the UK. The following releases from the Get Even album failed to make the UK Top Ten. All these singles were taken from the two different editions of their first album Get Even.\nAfter a brief hiatus, they returned with a brand new single in late 1989, \"Drive On\", which peaked at No. 39 in the UK, from their second album Trust. They then released a cover of the ballad by The Three Degrees, called \"When Will I See You Again?\", which peaked outside the UK top 40 at No. 43. The final release from their second album was the title track, \"Trust\", completely self-written, but only peaked at No. 53 in the UK.\nEMI America issued the album Trust in the USA mid-1990 adding two new songs which the group recorded in the USA and with a more American sound to break the US market. Both were released as singles there, with the lead single \"The Girl I Used to Know\" achieving success, peaking at No. 27 on the Billboard Hot 100. Nathan Moore has alleged the band were required to pay £100,000 to the mafia as part of a payola strategy to secure US airplay for the single.  \nThe follow-up single was \"Just a Heartbeat Away\", released commercially in Australia and as a promotional single in the US, which failed to chart. \"The Girl I Used to Know\" was released as a non-album single in Europe in early 1991 and peaked at No. 48 in the UK. The group disbanded that same year, with Moore joining another boyband, Worlds Apart.\nIn January 2011, an expanded edition of Get Even was released, featuring the original line up of the album, along with four bonus tracks. The bonus tracks are extended versions or remixes of \"I Should Have Lied\", \"The Harder I Try\", \"He Ain't No Competition\" and \"Be My Twin\".\n\n\n== Band members ==\nNathan Moore (vocals)  – born Nathan Marcellus Moore, 10 January 1965, Stamford Hill, London\nDavid White (guitar) - born David Benjamin White, 6 June 1965, Highbury, London\nCarl Fysh (keyboards) - born Carl Anthony Fysh, 25 January 1963, Oxford, Oxfordshire\nSteve Alexander (drums) – born Steven Alexander, 20 November 1962, Ystradgynlais, Powys\n\n\n== Former members ==\nEg White (bass) – born Francis Anthony White, 22 November 1966\n\n\n== Brother Beyond discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nGet Even (1988) – UK No. 9, AUS No. 89, GER No. 63\nTrust (1989) – UK No. 60\nThe Very Best of Brother Beyond (compilation, 2005)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== After the split ==\nLead singer Nathan Moore went on to sing with another boy band called Worlds Apart, successful in France in the mid-90s, and worked as a manager to such acts as Jessica Garlick.

Their production was critically acclaimed but a commercial failure, and none of their singles ever entered the UK Top 75. They released one album (which also didn't chart) for WEA in 1991, before Eg decided to go solo, covering the Jellyfish hit \"Stay Home\". Eg White won an Ivor Novello award for writing Will Young's \"Leave Right Now\", and has written songs for a variety of artists including Natalie Imbruglia, Joss Stone and Adele.\n\n\n== Eg and Alice discography ==\nAlbum\n24 Years of Hunger (1991)\nSingles\n\"Indian\" (1991)\n\"Doesn't Mean That Much to Me\" (1991)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPaul Gambaccini, Tim Rice, Jonathan Rice (1993), British Hit Singles, Guinness Publishing\nMoore Official: includes a detailed history and discography of Brother Beyond.\nMySpaceTV: short clip of Brother Beyond being interviewed in 1988.\nBrother Beyond discography at Discogs"

    "text": "Short Stack are an Australian pop punk band. The band consists of members Shaun Diviney (lead vocals, guitar), Andy Clemmensen (bass, backing vocals) and Bradie Webb (drums). Shannon Hotchkins was also a member of Short Stack before any song was performed or recorded. \nShort Stack were twice named Channel V Oz Artist of the Year, and produced two gold-selling albums, three top ten singles, a ARIA number one chart award and a platinum-selling single. \nThe group split in 2012, and their former label released Art Vandelay the following year without any promotion. In April 2014, the band announced their reformation and shortly released \"Television\". \"Amy\" was released as the lead single from third studio album Homecoming in August 2015. They disbanded shortly after in 2015. \nThey announced their return with a tour in 2020. They released their first song in six years \"Burn You Down\" in March 2021.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2002–2005: Formation of Short Stack ===\n\nShaun Diviney, Andy Clemmensen and Bradie Webb met on the train to the Hunter School of Performing Arts in Newcastle, New South Wales. Eventually, they decided to form a band and named it Short Stack. Originally, Shannon Hotchkins played drums, Webb played guitar, Clemmensen played bass and Diviney was the lead vocalist. However, after Hotchkins left, Diviney heard Webb playing on the drums and realised that he had the talent for drumming. Diviney became the lead vocalist and guitarist, Clemmensen stayed on bass, and Webb became the drummer.\n\n\n=== 2005–2009: Early years & Stack Is the New Black ===\nThree years after the band members met, they entered Youthrock, a competition for school-based bands. They failed to pass the first round in 2005, but were inspired to continue with their careers and made a limited-edition release of their first album, One Size Fits All, produced by Webb. They saved up money, and later released around 40 copies throughout local schools and the community.\nThey later returned to Youthrock in 2006, placing third. This was where they met Trevor Steel and Chris Johns of indie label Sunday Morning Records, who then signed the band in August 2007.\nIn 2008, Short Stack was awarded Channel V Oz Artist of the Year Award, beating other popular acts such as The Getaway Plan, The Living End, The Veronicas and Kisschasy.\nOn 14 August 2009, Short Stack released their debut album, Stack Is the New Black. The band has released four singles, \"Shimmy a Go Go\", \"Princess\", \"Sway, Sway Baby!\" and \"Ladies & Gentlemen\". \"Sway, Sway Baby!\" debuted at number 2 on the ARIA singles chart, making it the highest ranking debut on the week of its release; it dropped 25 places during the following week.\nShort Stack was awarded runner-up of the Oz Artist of the Year 2009, losing the award to Kisschasy.\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: This Is Bat Country ===\nOn 29 July 2010, Diviney announced that the first official single from their second album would be titled \"Planets\".\nOn 24 September, to coincide with the release of \"Planets\", Short Stack performed the song live at Federation Square in Melbourne. The event was televised live on Sunrise.\nIn an interview with The Music Network, the band revealed the new album was produced by Lee Groves and would be released in November. Shaun Diviney also announced a new orchestral sound, stating: \"We've been having fun looking backward through music rather than going down the electro-pop route which everybody seems to be doing now.\" Webb added: \"It's a lot more laid back. Less thrashy, more sexy.\"\nTheir second album, This Is Bat Country, was released on 12 November 2010..\nOn 18 October, Short Stack performed \"Planets\" live on The X Factor. On the same day, This Is Bat Country became available for pre-order, with a collector's limited edition pack including an action figure of the band and an exclusively signed poster.\nOn 2 November, Universal Music Australia confirmed that Short Stack would appear on the cover of issue #709 of the Australian edition of Rolling Stone magazine.

On 14 November, they performed \"Planets\" and \"We Dance to a Different Disco, Honey\" on Telethon. The third single from This Is Bat Country, \"Heartbreak Made Me a Killer\", was released as an EP on 25 March 2011.

They made the top 4 alongside 360, Guy Sebastian and New Empire.\nThe band also released their first documentary, The Story of Short Stack, based on their road to success. It was directed, produced and edited by Clemmensen. In the documentary, the name of the new album was released as Art Vandelay, as well as the track listing for that album.\nOn 30 March 2012, Short Stack announced via their Facebook page that they would no longer be making music together stating that \"even though we are no longer making music, we still remain the closest friends.\" Along with the announcement they released their last ever song and music video, \"S.O.U.L.\". This also halted the making of Art Vandelay and concluded Short Stack forever.\n\n\"Dear friends, As you may be aware, stack is no more. To everyone who has supported the band in any way, I cannot thank you enough. From the ones who told their friends about us to the ones who camped out before shows. For me, since the band started when I was 15, it's always been about the music I wrote and how it effected people. The greatest feeling was you singing my words back at a show, living with the albums and letting something I created be a part of your lives. These times will be some of the best of my life with the boys/the crew and we still remain the closest friends. But the show must go on. If you try to recapture yesterday you will only lose tomorrow. I am starting work on my next project which is honestly the best thing I have ever done. I'm falling in love with music all over again, feeling a fire I haven't in years. I'm heading over to LA / NY mid year to write and do music, working with artists I love & enjoying life but most importantly I feel it's time to START something again. See you on the road soon, Diviney.\"\n\n\n=== 2012–2013: Post-breakup ===\n\nDiviney has continued his music career, which he is enthusiastic about. He made a trip to Los Angeles in mid-2012 to write some more music for his solo career. Diviney also announced that Webb is likely to continue his career in producing music and that Clemmensen aims to pursue a future in film directing.\nOn 15 October 2012, it was announced that Clemmensen would make an appearance in the long-running soap opera Neighbours.

    "text": "Fine Young Cannibals (FYC) were an English pop rock band formed in Birmingham, England, in 1984 by former The Beat band bassist David Steele and guitarist Andy Cox with singer Roland Gift (formerly of the Akrylykz). Their self-titled 1985 debut album contained \"Johnny Come Home\" and a cover of \"Suspicious Minds\", two songs that were top 40 hits in the UK, Canada, Australia and Europe. Their 1989 album, The Raw & the Cooked, topped the UK, US, Australian and Canadian album charts, and contained their two Billboard Hot 100 number ones: \"She Drives Me Crazy\" and \"Good Thing\".\nIn 1990, the band won two Brit Awards: Best British Group and Best British Album (for The Raw & the Cooked).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was formed in 1984 after the dissolution of The Beat, with whom Cox and Steele previously played.  Their name came from the 1960 film All the Fine Young Cannibals starring Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood. The duo of Steele and Cox spent eight months listening to over 500 cassettes of potential singers before picking Gift. They had difficulty obtaining a record contract, but when a video of their song \"Johnny Come Home\" appeared on British TV show The Tube, recording contract offers flowed in immediately. The band's eponymous debut album was released in 1985, spawning two UK hit singles, \"Johnny Come Home\" and a cover of Elvis Presley's \"Suspicious Minds\" featuring additional vocals by Jimmy Somerville. The two songs also became hits internationally, charting in the top 40 in Europe, Canada, and Australia although they failed to make a significant impact on the US charts.\nFine Young Cannibals appeared as the house band in a nightclub in the 1987 comedy film Tin Men and also contributed songs to the film's soundtrack, including \"Good Thing\".\nIn the gap between their first and second albums, Steele and Cox released the instrumental house single \"Tired of Getting Pushed Around\" in 1987 as \"Two Men, a Drum Machine and a Trumpet\", which reached No. 18 in the UK Singles Chart and was popular on the U.S. dance chart. During this time, Gift appeared in the movie Sammy and Rosie Get Laid.\nThe band continued their international success with the singles \"She Drives Me Crazy\" and \"Good Thing\", from the 1989 album The Raw & the Cooked. Both songs reached #1 in the United States. \"She Drives Me Crazy\" also topped the Australian chart for three non-consecutive weeks and peaked at #5 in the UK, while \"Good Thing\" peaked at #7 in both countries. The Raw & the Cooked included three songs the band had recorded for Tin Men (including \"Good Thing\"), and their cover of the Buzzcocks' \"Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)\" recorded for the film Something Wild.\nIn 1990, the band contributed a version of Cole Porter's \"Love for Sale\" to the AIDS research benefit album Red Hot + Blue, produced by the Red Hot Organization.\nFine Young Cannibals disbanded in 1992, although they briefly returned to the studio in 1996 to record a new single, \"The Flame\", for the greatest hits compilation The Finest.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nAndy Cox – guitars, keyboards\nRoland Gift – vocals\nDavid Steele – bass, keyboards, drum machine\nSession and touring members\nMartin Parry – drums, percussion\nGraeme Hamilton – trumpet, piano\nNigel Darvill - Keyboards\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Remix albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Billboard number-one singles\nList of artists who reached number one in the United States\nList of Billboard number-one dance club songs\nList of artists who reached number one on the U.S. Dance Club Songs chart\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nFine Young Cannibals discography at Discogs"

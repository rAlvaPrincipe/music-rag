    "text": "Creaming Jesus were an English band, influenced by gothic rock, punk and thrash metal, who formed in London, England. Formed in 1987, their original line up was Andy (vocals) Lil (vocals) Tally (bass) Roy (drums) Lindy (drums) and Paul (guitar). Their original sound was a wall of percussive noise (two drummers and a drum machine), Slayer-influenced thrash metal guitarists and screamed vocals.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe band's first release was a track on the House of Dolls fanzine covermounted 7\" single.\nThey then self-released the 12\" EP Nailed Up For Nothing, before being signed to Jungle Records of London, who re-released the EP and put them in the studio to record two further EPs, Mug and Bark (which included a cover version of the Cure's 'A Forest')\nGuitarist Paul Scanlan left following the release of their first three 12\" EPs, and joined the Satanic metal band Akercocke\nThe group then recruited Richard and Mario as guitarists, and Des replaced Lindy on drums, to produce their most enduring line up.\nIn 1990, Creaming Jesus went on tour with Fields of the Nephilim to coincide with their debut album Too Fat To Run, Too Stupid To Hide. The band returned almost immediately to the studio to record two more singles, \"Deadtime\" and \"Ditchdweller V\". Their second album, Guilt By Association, produced by Brian Chuck New, remained in the indie charts for months, as they toured the country.\nFollowing the departure of Des, who was replaced by percussionist Roger, a further session yielded the original Headrush E.P. which coincided with a full four-week UK tour. They also toured extensively throughout Europe and Scandinavia, and were one of the first UK bands to play in the newly independent country of (what was) Czechoslovakia. Overseas demand led to their first three singles being compiled for an album It's Dance Magic.\nFor their third album, the band took time off from touring to prepare the new material and after much planning recorded with Dave Fridmann of Mercury Rev as producer in Sweetfish, an isolated converted barn in upstate New York. They had met when Creaming Jesus and Mercury Rev toured the UK and Europe together on Mercury Rev's first ever dates in Europe. The result of this session being the album Chaos for the Converted (1994), preceded by the single \"Hamburg\", their style evolving away from the relentless industrial gothic thrash of their previous releases to explore a more experimental psychedelic sound.\nThe band's final performance in 1994 was at the Venue in New Cross, South London, a gig which was recorded and later released by Jungle Records under the title End of an Error. By this time their sound was further augmented by the addition of violin player Ffion, who now plays in the band Pronghorn.\nThe track \"Reptile\" from the Guilt... album made an appearance in an episode of the TV series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\n\n\n== Related projects ==\nSinger Andy went on to play in extreme noise band, Ridiculous, with members of Headbutt and The Homage Freaks; releasing one track on the first Household Name records release. He then produced music under various pseudonyms including Armchair Generals, The Master (Hubcap Decorator Trilogy) and Filtrum (Sad Robot Happy Robot). He is now a member of Giant Paw and touring with comedian Andrew O'Neill with their steampunk band The Men That Will Not Be Blamed for Nothing.\nRoy and Roger went on to set up Noise Management and Noise Merchandise\nGuitarist Richard Corden went on the play with Star 69 who relocated to Los Angeles, California, US in 1995.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nNailed Up for Nothing EP (12\") Jungle Records 1989\nMug EP EP (12\") Jungle Records 1989\nBark EP EP (12\") Jungle Records 1990\nToo Fat to Run, Too Stupid to Hide (LP) Jungle Records 1990\nDead Time EP (12\") (CD, Maxi) Jungle Records 1991\nDitch Dweller V...The Story Continues (CD, Maxi) Jungle Records 1991\nGuilt by Association (CD, Album) Jungle Records 1992\nHeadrush (CD, EP) Jungle Records 1992\nHamburg EP (CD/EP)\nChaos for the Converted (LP) Jungle Records 1994\nEnd of an Error (LP) Jungle Records 1994\nTracks appear on:\n\nUntitled (7\") Jessie The God House of Dolls 1988\nNew Alternatives (LP) Hungerford Nightbreed Recordings 1990\nGothic Rock (CD) Reptile Jungle Records 1992\nGothic Rock (2xLP, Gat) Reptile Jungle Records 1992\nGothic Rock 1 (2xCD) Reptile Cleopatra 1993\nThe Whip (2xCD) Upside Down Jungle Records 1993\nGothic Rock 2 (3xLP, Gat) Celebrity Cannibalism ...

    "text": "The Cistercian Monks of Stift Heiligenkreuz is the artistic name of the Choralschola of Cistercian monks from the Lower Austrian abbey Heiligenkreuz who have so far recorded six CDs of Gregorian chant that have attracted the attention of European and world music public. The names of individual singers have never been specifically published because monks see themselves primarily as people dedicated to God who sing for religious and non-professional reasons.\nThe Cistercians of the Heiligenkreuz abbey founded in 2011 their own record label Obsculta Music and have received prestigious awards and recognitions for their public musical achievements. Their first music album Chant: Music for Paradise was released by Universal Music in 2008 (under this name the album was released in Europe, while in the rest of the world it was released under the title Chant: Music for the Soul). Just this album achieved several gold and platinum music recording certifications soon after its release and also won the German music award ECHO Klassik in the category \"Bestseller of the Year\" in 2009.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n2008 – Chant: Music for Paradise, UCJ Music / Universal Music, CD 4766774 / Chant: Music for the Soul, London – Decca, CD B0011489-02\n2008 – Chant: Music for Paradise, Universal Music / UCJ Music, 2xCD 4766977\n2010 – Best of Gregorian Chant (compilation album): Zisterzienser Mönche vom Stift Heiligenkreuz, Choralschola des Klosters Santo Domingo de Silos u.a., Deutsche Grammophon, CD 480 3408\n2011 – Chant: Amor et Passio, Obsculta Music / Preiser Records, CD 91200\n2011 – VESPERÆ.

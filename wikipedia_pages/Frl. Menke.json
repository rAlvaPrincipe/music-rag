    "text": "Franziska Menke (born 4 November 1960), known professionally as Frl. Menke, is a German singer. She was a star of the Neue Deutsche Welle genre of German popular music in the early 1980s. Menke is best known for her single \"Hohe Berge\" (\"High Mountains\"), which was a top 10 hit in the German charts in 1982 and has sold more than 2.5 million copies to date.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMenke is the daughter of the German songwriter, producer and publisher Joe Menke.

She sold more than three million records during 1982 and 1983.\nMenke gave birth to two children at the end of the 1980s and composed various jingles for radio stations and advertisement campaigns.

    "text": "MALIQ & D'Essentials is an Indonesian jazz and soul music band from Jakarta. Since their appearance in the Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival in 2005, Maliq & D'Essentials popularity has increased, especially among young people in Jakarta.\nThe combination of Indonesian and English in their songs has become one of the typical flagships of their music. Their work is considered to be distinctive among other Indonesian music.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMaliq & D'Essentials was conceived on 15 May 2002 with eight personnel under a genre they call organic music. The name MALIQ itself is an acronym for Music and Live Instrument Quality as the brainchild of brothers Angga & Widi Puradiredja (the group's vocalist and drummer, respectively; as well as producer, composer and arranger for the group). The completion of the band became full circle with the presence of Indah & Dimi (vocals), Ifa (keys), Jawa (bass), Satrio (guitars) and Amar (horns). The group started out performing soul and soul-inspired music at different lounges and cafes in Jakarta. The first two years they went through was a solidification process for the group; as well as a way to introduce soul and/or soulful-inspired music to the Indonesian public; as it is yet to be widely known at the time of the group's establishment.\n\n\n=== 2004-06: 1st ===\nCome 2004, Maliq & D'Essentials officially became part of the Indonesian music recording industry with the release of their premiere album, 1st, with the single \"Terdiam\". A second single, \"Untitled\", soon followed and became the hit song that put the group on the map. The third single from their premiere album, \"Sampai Kapan\", is a collaboration with Malaysian singer Camelia. The fourth and final single from 1st Maliq & D'Essentials is entitled \"Kangen\". By 2006, the group released a repackaged version of their premiere album entitled 1st Maliq & D'Essentials Special Edition with a hit single entitled \"The One\". At the same time, Dimi one of the vocalists decided to leave the band to pursue a solo career. The group's first record had not only given them a name for themselves in the Indonesian music industry, but also gave way to their rise to fame in neighboring countries of Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam.\nBy this time, the group were nominated for and/or won many awards such as MTV Indonesia Music Awards, Anugerah Planet Muzik, AMI Awards, & MTV Asia Awards.\n\n\n=== 2007-08: Free Your Mind ===\nIn early 2007, Maliq & D'Essentials released their sophomore record, Free Your Mind with a hit single entitled \"Heaven\"; followed by \"Beri Cinta Waktu\" as a second single not long after. Two more noteworthy achievements happened during this particular time. The first was being awarded Best Jazz Album for Free Your Mind in the 2008 AMI Awards. The second was a soundtrack for a major motion picture. Thus, two singles from Free Your Mind (Repackaged) (released in early 2008) \"Dia\" and \"Kau Yang Bisa\", became the original soundtrack for the movie Claudia/Jasmine. In August 2008, they also performed a concert at Brisbane, Australia to entertain Indonesian students who are in the country.\n\n\n=== 2009: Mata Hati Telinga ===\nAround this time, the group went through another change in their core personnel. After Dimi's departure around 2006; Satrio, the group's guitarist decided to leave and was quickly replaced by Arya Aditya Ramadhya, more widely known as \"Lale\". By 2009, the group released their newest record entitled Mata Hati Telinga. Now the youngest member of Maliq & D'Essentials, Lale with his rock background had added another color to the group's unique sound. The pop-rock up-tempo song \"Pilihanku\" was chosen as the first single from the third album. It was somewhat different from what the public would know of Maliq & D'Essentials; although the group's color never faded away from the newly explored influences. Along with second single \"Coba Katakan\", Maliq & D'Essentials was able to broaden the horizon of their listeners and/or fans. The third album Mata Hati Telinga also received the title as the \"Best Album 2009\" by Rolling Stone Indonesia magazine.\nAnother milestone for the group; along with the release of Mata Hati Telinga album was the introduction of The One Management and Organic Records. It was created to accommodate the group with a comprehensive, open, secure, proper and prestigious management; along with a record company that would give them as much freedom to explore their music. In addition through Organic Records, Maliq & D'Essentials assumed the role of executive producers for great new talents such as Twentyfirst Night, Boogiemen, Soulvibe, Renita, Djemima, Sir Dandy, Rock n Roll Mafia and The Upstairs.\nIn March 2009, Maliq & D'Essentials performed for the fourth time at the 5th annual Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival, after being absent the previous year. The performance featured The Organic All-Stars which included Twentyfirst Night, Boogiemen and Renita. Recorded live at the Jakarta Convention Centre, the performance became an addition to the group's discography as a DVD distributed by early 2010.\nOver the years of the group's existence, they have developed a following of loyal fans, eventually named D'Essentials. By early 2009, a few months before the group's 7th Anniversary, a formal D'Essentials Team was established. As a result, a premiere (and not to mention quite successful) collaboration between The One Management/Organic Records and D'Essentials happened at Maliq & D'Essentials \"7th Year Celebration\" to celebrate the group's 7th Anniversary; as well as a form of appreciation to all D'Essentials who had been supporting them.\n\n\n=== 2010-11: The Beginning of a Beautiful Life ===\nTheir fourth album, The Beginning of a Beautiful Life, was released to the market in June 2010, with the song \"Terlalu\" as the first single, followed by \"Menari\" and \"Penasaran\" as a second single and third single.

The first single from this album is \"Setapak Sriwedari\" and followed by the second single with a dangdut genre, \"Drama Romantika\". The third single of this album is \"Dunia Sekitar\".

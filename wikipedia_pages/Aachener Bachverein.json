    "text": "Aachener Bachverein (often abbreviated as ABV) is a German oratorio choir of the Evangelical Church in the Rhineland in the city of Aachen that was founded in 1913 by Heinrich Boell. Although the chorus sings a varied repertoire that encompasses music from all historical periods to new compositions, the ensemble is particularly known for their historically informed performances of baroque and classical period music that are often made in conjunction with internationally renowned instrumental ensembles and orchestras. The choir frequently tours, has had several of their performances broadcast on German radio, and has recorded a number of cantatas by J.S. Bach.\n\n\n== List of directors ==\nHeinrich Boell (1913–1924)\nRudolf Mauersberger (1924–1925)\nErhard Mauersberger (1925–1928)\nHans Klotz (1928-1942)\nHans Hulverscheidt (1956–1974)\nJohannes Geffert (1974–1979)\nHeribert Breuer (1979–1983)\nWolfgang Karius (1983–2008)\nGeorg Hage (2008–present)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Aachen: Aachener Bachverein: Passion der besonderen Art\".

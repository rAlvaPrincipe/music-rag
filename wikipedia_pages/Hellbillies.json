    "text": "Hellbillies is a Norwegian rock band, formed in 1990 in Ål, a town located in Hallingdal.\n\n\n== Profile and history ==\nHellbellies are among Norway's most popular recording artists. As of 2012, they have released 13 albums—including a compilation and two live albums—as well as three live concert DVDs. Their lyrics are written and sung in the dialect of the Hallingdal area of Norway, and there is evidence of influence from traditional (folk) Norwegian music, giving a distinctive \"Norwegian\" flavor to their country music.\nTheir early albums often included songs originally recorded by country music artists from the US with Hellbillies writing new lyrics in the Ål dialect of Norwegian, with the settings of the lyrics differing sharply from the source songs. Examples include Ei krasafaren steinbu (Past the Point of Rescue by Hal Ketchum) and Pela stein (Against the Grain by Garth Brooks).\nLater efforts have included much more original material that reflect contemporary Norwegian people and Norwegian life and issues. They have also gradually changed their musical style from country to rock.\nThey have collaborated with musicians from the US. For example, Rob Hajacos from Nashville, who plays the fiddle on most Garth Brooks albums, Rob plays on three of Hellbillies’ albums.\nIn 2013 Hellbillies appeared at the Kongsberg Jazz Festival performing together with Jazz guests the Violin virtuoso Ola Kvernberg and the super trumpeter Mathias Eick. In 2013 they also contributed to the book Think Like a Rockstar (Tenk som en rockestjerne, written by Ståle Økland.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\nCurrent members\n\nAslag Haugen – lead vocals, electric and acoustic guitars (1990–present)\nLars Håvard Haugen – electric guitars, harmony and lead vocals (1990–present)\nBjørn Gunnar Sando – drums (1990–present)\nLive and studio members\n\nEgil Stemkens – bass, harmony vocals (2016–present)\nLars Christian Narum – piano and organ (2003–present)\nFormer members\n\nArne Moslåtten – accordion, flute, acoustic guitar, percussion (1990-2013), lyrics (1990-today)\nArne Henry Sandum – bass (1990-2016)\nLasse Hafreager – piano and organ (1993-2000)\nTrond Nagell Dahl – piano and organ (2001-2003)\n\n\n== Honors ==\n1993: Spellemannprisen in the class Country-rock awarded for the album Pela Stein\n2007: Spellemannprisen awarded 'This year's spellemann for the album Spissrotgang\n2022: Spellemannprisen awarded the honorary award for their long running career.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nSylvspente Boots (1992)\nPela Stein (1993)\nLakafant (1995)\nDrag (1996)\nSol Over Livet (1999)\nUrban Twang (2001)\nNiende (2004)\nSpissrotgang (2007)\nLeite etter Lykka (2010)\nTretten (2012)\nSøvnlaus (2016)\nBlå dag (2021)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nLive Laga (1997)\nCoolTur (2002)\nLevande Live (2014)\n30 år på vegen: Live 20-21 (2024)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n\"Hallo Telenor\" (2007)\n\"Den finast eg veit (2013)\" (2013)\n\"Dirkefri Live\" (2014)\n\"I eksil på sundrehall\" (2020)\n\"Blå dag\" (2020)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website"

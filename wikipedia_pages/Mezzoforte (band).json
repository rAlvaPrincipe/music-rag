    "text": "Mezzoforte is an instrumental jazz-funk fusion band from Iceland, formed in 1977.\nThey signed a record deal with Icelandic label Steinar. Their biggest hit single was \"Garden Party\" (1983), taken from their fourth album (second international release) Surprise Surprise. It peaked at number 17 in the UK Singles Chart. The solo that takes place two minutes into \"Garden Party\", was created and played on the flugelhorn by English trumpeter, Stephen Dawson. \"Garden Party\" was later covered by Herb Alpert, at a slower speed than the original, apparently as he had learned the track from the single played at the wrong speed. Another single, \"Rockall\" spent one week at number 75 in the same listing in June that year, and was used as a signature tune by several European radio chart shows.\nThe band was named after the traditional musical term mezzo forte, an instruction to play literally \"moderately loud\".\n\n\n== Band members ==\nOriginal line-up from 1977:\n\nEyþór Gunnarsson  – keyboards\nJóhann Ásmundsson – bass\nGunnlaugur Briem-Gulli Briem (Gulli) – drums\nFriðrik Karlsson (Frissi) – guitars\nOther members, present and past:\n\nBruno Müller – guitars (2005–present)\nSebastian Studnitzky – trumpet & keyboards (2005–present)\nThomas Dyani – percussion (2004–present)\nJonas Wall – saxophones (2013–present)\nAri Bragi Karason – trumpet\nStaffan William-Olsson – guitars (2003–2004)\nJoel Palsson – saxophones (2003)\nGuðmundur Pétursson – guitars (2003)\nÓskar Guðjónsson – saxophones (1996–2003, 2005–2013)\nKåre Kolve – saxophones (1991–1994)\nBjörn Thorarensen – synthesizers (1980–1982)\nKristinn Svavarsson – saxophones (1982–1985)\nDavid O'Higgins – saxophones (1985–1989, 2002–2004)\nJeroen De Rijk – percussion (1984–1986)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n==== Compilation albums ====\n\n\n==== Video albums ====\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nmezzoforte.com  (official site)\nMezzoforte at AllMusic\nMezzoforte discography at Discogs\ngullibriem.com  (Gulli Briem's site)\nthefeelgoodcollection.com (Fridrik Karlsson's site)\nbruno-mueller-music.de (Bruno Müller's site)\nstudnitzky.de (Sebastian Studnitzky's site)\njookraus.de (Joo Kraus' site)"

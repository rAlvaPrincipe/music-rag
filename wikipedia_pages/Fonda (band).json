    "text": "Fonda is an American indie pop band from Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band formed in 1994 when singer/keyboardist Emily Cook and guitarist David Klotz met while both working for the same film production company.  With the addition of drummer Aaron Ryder, the group played its first live dates at area clubs like Spaceland and Cafe Bleu, and in 1998 issued their debut EP Music for Beginners on the Top Quality label, with the cut \"Crazy Love\" becoming a staple on L.A. radio station KROQ.\nTheir debut album, The Invisible Girl, peaked at No. 39 on CMJ's Radio 200 Chart in December, 1999.  Dave Newton, guitarist for the British band The Mighty Lemon Drops was an active member of Fonda between 1998 and 2003.  \nIn 2001, Fonda wrote and performed the theme song to the Miramax/Dimension film, Spy Kids.  \"Spy Kids (Save The World)\" was released as a CD/DVD single in Europe on Gold Circle Records.  The song received regular airplay on Radio Disney and the accompanying music video was shown on the Nickelodeon TV Channel.   Fonda has since released two full-length albums for the Parasol Records imprint label Hidden Agenda Records. Actor Ted Raimi directed the music video for Fonda's song \"Close To Home\".\nFonda released their fourth album in January 2013.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Invisible Girl (1999, Top Quality Records)\nThe Strange and The Familiar (2001, Parasol/Hidden Agenda Records)\nCatching Up To The Future (2003, Parasol/Hidden Agenda Records)\nSell Your Memories (2013, Minty Fresh)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nThe Music For Beginners (1998, Top Quality Records)\nBetter Days (2011, Fonda Music, Inc.)\nBetter Days (Expanded Vinyl Edition - 2011, Minty Fresh)\n\n\n=== Singles (7\" vinyl) ===\n\"Summer Land\" / \"People and Stars\" (2000, Planting Seeds Records)\n\n\n== External links ==\nFonda's website\nFonda on Twitter\nFonda on FaceBook\nFonda on Apple Music\nDavid Klotz on YouTube\n\n\n== References =="

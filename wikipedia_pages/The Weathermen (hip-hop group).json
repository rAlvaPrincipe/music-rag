The group took its name from the revolutionary organization Weather Underground (who were originally called The Weathermen), and its debut album was to be called The New Left.\n\n\n== History ==\nAmerican rapper Cage formed The Weathermen, a hip hop collective alongside Camu Tao, El-P, Copywrite, Yak Ballz, Tame One, Breeze Brewin, Jakki tha Motamouth and Vast Aire. The Weathermen released a mixtape in 2003 titled The Conspiracy, on Eastern Conference Records. The Conspiracy was to be the last work Cage would record for Eastern Conference, leaving the label over alleged non-payment. In the summer of 2010, Cage announced on his Facebook page the beginning of a collaboration between himself and Aesop Rock called \"Two of Every Animal\", along with the news that there would be no new Weathermen without Camu Tao.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nMixtapes\nThe Conspiracy (2003)\nSingles\n\"The Only WEATHERMEN Song\" (2001)\n\"Same As It Never Was\"/\"Sneak Preview\" 12\" split with Mr. Lif & Murs (2001)\n\"5 Left In the Clip\"/\"Tame As It Ever Was\" 12\" split with Tame One (2003)\n\"5 Left in the Clip\" Original b/w RJD2 Remix 12\" (2003)\nAlbum appearances\n\"Same As It Never Was\" from Definitive Jux Presents II (2001)\n\"Gut You\" from Eastern Conference Records (sampler) (2001)\n\"5 Left In The Clip\" & \"Gut You\" from Eastern Conference All Stars III (2002)\n\"Dead Disnee\" from Cage's The Purple Rain Mix CD Vol. 1 (2003)\n\"Weatherwhatevermen\" & \"Let The Games Begin\" from Eastern Conference All Stars IV (2004)\n\"Reports Of A Possible Kidnapping\" from Definitive Jux Presents IV (2009)\n\"The Only Weathermen Song\" from Copywrite's The Rarities (2010)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeathermen Myspace Page\nRemembering Camu Tao"

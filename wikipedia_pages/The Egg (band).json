    "text": "The Egg are a British electronic dance music band, consisting of Ned Scott (keyboards), Maff Scott (drums), Paul Marshall (bass) and Matt White (lead guitar).\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in the early 1990s in Oxford, England, the Egg released its first EP Shopping (1995) on the independent record label, Cup of Tea Records. Having been signed by China Records, in 1996 the band released the album Albumen in the United States on Discovery Records in 1997. In 1998, the follow-up album, Travelator, was released, produced by Tim Holmes of Death in Vegas. In 2000, the group recorded the theme tune to the ITV series, At Home with the Braithwaites.\nFollowing Travelator, the Egg began exploring the new directions. Following their Mellowmania EP in 2002, they were signed by Bar de Lune Records, a subsidiary of Beechwood Music. Beechwood folded the following year just before a return with their new album, Forwards, (produced by Benji Vaughan) and subsequently released on Squarepeg Records in 2004.\nThe single \"Walking Away\" (featuring Sophie Barker of Zero 7 fame) was released in 2005, and further remixes commissioned by licensees. This became a crossover hit, and spawned the bootleg by David Guetta, \"Love Don't Let Me Go (Walking Away)\", to reach #3 in the UK Singles Chart in August 2006.\nIn 2006, the Egg played at The Big Chill, Bestival, Glastonbury, and other venues across Europe. The following year saw more UK music festivals appearances.\nIn 2007 the band toured Australia and Brazil for the first time playing most major cities in each.\nIn 2008 the Egg contributed the song \"Trails and Tribulations\" to the Songs for Survival Survival International charity album, and later in the year they played at Camp Bisco 7 in Mariaville, NY. They also toured the U.S. extensively in 2008, 2009, and 2010.\nContinued live performances have seen the Egg play at venues and festivals across the UK and the globe and as Glastonbury stalwarts, 2023 saw the Egg headline the Glade stage on the Saturday night of the festival.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nNed Scott (keyboards, vocals)\nMaff Scott (drums)\nPaul Marshall (bass)\nMatt White (guitars)\n\n\n=== Touring members ===\nTodd Graft / Max Hattler (visuals)\nShaun Hunter (sound engineer) (Programmer/co-writer)\nChris Mitchell (guitar)\n\n\n=== Former touring members ===\nDrew Thane (2009, US tour only)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n1996 Albumen\n1998 Travelator – UK #126\n1999 Get Some Mixes Together\n2004 Forwards\n2006 Forwards Special Edition\n2012 Something to Do\n2018 Galactic Love Machine\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n2008 Live at Cargo\n2009 Live at Camp Bisco\n2009 Live in Saint Louis (video)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n1995 Get Some Money Together featuring remix by Fila Brazillia, Heights of Abraham, Statik Sound System\n1995 Shopping EP\n2003 Mellowmania\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1997 \"Bend\" – Fila Brazillia mixes etc.\n1997 \"Get Some Money to Get Her\" (Discovery USA)\n1999 \"Getting Away with It\" – mixes by Rollo Armstrong, streetlife originals – #58 UK\n1999 \"Hey Charlie\" – mixes by Next men\n2006 \"Walking Away\" – mixes by Grand National, Dusty Kid Pop and Tocadisco – UK #56\n2006 \"Love Don't Let Me Go (Walking Away)\" vs. David Guetta – #3 UK\n2007 \"Nothing\" – mixes by Cicada, Dusty Kid Pop and Plimsol\n2012 \"Catch\" – mixes by Psychemagik, The C90s, Hurukan and Tom Laroye\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Egg – Official website\nSquarepeg Records – label website\nThe Egg's Photographer"

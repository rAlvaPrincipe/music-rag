    "text": "The Summit format is used in jazz to bring together performers on a particular musical instrument. Though these recordings often feature other musicians (notably a rhythm section), the main instrument is focused upon in a celebratory way.\nThe saxophone quartet has since become a somewhat common format, and to a lesser extent the bass clarinet quartet.  Additionally, all-percussion ensembles and a cappella groups are common and focus upon a single instrument in a similar way.\nGerman MPS Records produced several albums of this type, including New Violin Summit, Alto Summit, Vibes Summit, The Gypsy Jazz Violin Summit, The String Summit, Trombone Summit and\nYou Better Fly Away by Clarinet Summit.\n\n\n== Clarinet ==\n\n\n== Saxophones ==\nSaxophone Summit\n2008: Joshua Redman, Michael Brecker, Dave Liebman, Joe Lovano, George Garzone\n\nSoprano Summit(World Jazz WJCD-5/13)\n1974: Kenny Davern, Dick Hyman, Bucky Pizzarelli, Bob Wilber, Marty Grosz, George Duvivier, Bobby Rosengarden, Milt Hinton, Tommy Benford\n\nAlto Summit\n1968: Alto Summit (MPS) by Lee Konitz, Pony Poindexter, Phil Woods and Leo Wright (with pianist Steve Kuhn, bassist Palle Danielsson and drummer Jon Christensen)   (MPS Records)\n1996: Phil Woods, Vincent Herring, Antonio Hart, (with Carl Allen on drums, Anthony Wonsey on piano, and Reuben Rogers on bass) (Milestone Records)\n\nBaritone\nBaritone Madness is a 1978 album from saxophonist Nick Brignola, featuring Pepper Adams, Ted Curson, Derek Smith, Dave Holland, Roy Haynes (Bee Hive Records).\n\n\n== Flute ==\nFlute Summit\n1974: Jeremy Steig, James Moody, Sahib Shihab, Chris Hinze (Atlantic)\n\n\n== Percussion ==\nPercussion Summit\n1984: Urszula Dudziak, Johnny Dyani, Okay Temiz, Gunter Sommer, Ed Thigpen, Mariusz Maurycy (tambourine), John Purcell (Moers Music)\n\n\n== Vocal ==\nVocal Summit\nLauren Newton, Urszula Dudziak, Jeanne Lee, Jay Clayton, Bobby McFerrin, Bob Stoloff\n\n\n== Trombone ==\nTrombone Summit\n1980: Albert Mangelsdorff, Bill Watrous, Jiggs Whigham, Kai Winding (MPS)\n\nTrombone Workshop\n1980: Albert Mangelsdorff, Bill Watrous, Jiggs Whigham, Kai Winding, with Allan Ganley, Horace Parlan, Mads Vinding (Pausa Records)\n\n\n== Trumpet ==\nTrumpet Summit\nDizzy Gillespie, Clark Terry and Freddie Hubbard recorded in 1980 an album called The Trumpet Summit Meets the Oscar Peterson Big 4, also featuring Oscar Peterson, Joe Pass, Ray Brown and Bobby Durham.

    "text": "Crow and the Canyon is a bluegrass band from Portland, Oregon. The band formed in 2014.\nIn March, 2018, the band made a tour of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and Zambia sponsored by the U.S. Department of State to introduce bluegrass music to Africans by conducting workshops and performances. A Country Standard Time review of their 2015 album Leaving Soon said it was a \"gentle folk-pop\" sound, with notable harmonization of lead singers Ben Larsen and Leigh Jones. Larsen went on to create a solo album in 2021.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nYoungblood, Steven (March 17, 2018). \"Bluegrass concert in Ethiopia underscores wisdom of cultural exchanges\".

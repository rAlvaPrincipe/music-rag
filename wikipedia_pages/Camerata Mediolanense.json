    "text": "Camerata Mediolanense is an ensemble of musicians established in Milan, Italy in 1994. Their music can be classified as darkwave/neoclassical, with folk elements.\nThe head of the project is diplomated classical composer Elena Previdi, other members come from different training and musical experiences: percussionist and singer Trevor and percussionist Manuel Aroldi come from the post-punk scene, while former lead singer Daniela Bedeski has a past in folk music.\nCamerata Mediolanense literally means \"group of chamber musicians from Milan\" (\"Mediolanense\" means \"from Mediolanum\", the Ancient Roman name for Milan). Their music is composed according to the traditions and history of Italy and Europe's classical and folk music, using martial percussions, sublime voices, keyboards, and electronic devices.\nThe band was in 2008 attacked by a far-left commando in a bar of Fribourg.

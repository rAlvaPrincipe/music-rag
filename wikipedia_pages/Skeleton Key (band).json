    "text": "Skeleton Key is an American rock band based in New York City, United States. The band originated in 1994 by bassist and singer Erik Sanko, the only constant member of the band.  His vision was to create a sound \"luxurious, yet affordable,\" using antique microphones, primitive guitars, and unconventional percussion.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band’s first release was the Human Pin Cushion single with Dedicated Records.  In 1996 the band released an eponymous EP on Motel Records that Rolling Stone said \"shows how pop culture and high culture can bring everyone to the same place.\"\nThe following year saw the band release their first full-length album, Fantastic Spikes Through Balloon, on Capitol Records.  The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1998 for its Stefan Sagmeister-designed artwork, which featured holes punched through the booklet of liner notes and, for promotional copies, a steel spike housed within the spine enclosure of the CD jewel case.\nIn early 2011 the band successfully raised over $9,000 on the online crowdfunding website Kickstarter, used to finish production of their next album.  Later that year, they signed with Arctic Rodeo Recordings and announced an upcoming release.  On March 7, 2012, a promotional video of the band in the studio was released via Visions Magazin.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nErik Sanko – Bass guitar, vocals\nCraig LeBlang – Guitar\nBenjamin Clapp – \"Junk\" percussion\nBob Vaccarelli – Drum kit\n\n\n=== Former ===\nChris Maxwell – Guitar\nRick Lee – \"Junk\" percussion\nMatthias Bossi – Drum kit\nSean Sankey – Drum kit\nNic Brown - Drums\nTim Keiper – \"Junk\" percussion\nSteve Calhoon - Drum kit/Junk percussion\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHuman Pin Cushion Single (1995, Dedicated Records)\nSkeleton Key EP (1996, Motel Records)\nFantastic Spikes Through Balloon (1997, Capitol Records)\nAn Ellipse (2001, Exquisite Corpse Records)\nObtainium (2002, Ipecac Recordings)\nLive at Metro (2004, Re:Live)\nThe Lyons Quintette EP (2005, Do Tell Records)\nGravity is the Enemy (2012, Arctic Rodeo Recordings)\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIndependent Music Awards 2013: Gravity is the Enemy - Best Eclectic Album\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site\nThe Unofficial Site\nSK on MySpace"

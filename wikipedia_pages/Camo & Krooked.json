    "text": "Camo & Krooked are an electronic music duo from Vienna, Austria with their musical roots embedded in drum and bass, consisting of Reinhard \"Camo\" Rietsch (born 12 November 1983 in Salzburg) and Markus \"Krooked\" Wagner (born 31 July 1989 in Lilienfeld).\n\n\n== History ==\nBoth Rietsch and Wagner have been producing music since 2002. They met at one of Rietsch's gigs and collaborated to form Camo & Krooked in 2007. Their first collaboration was the track \"Play It\" from Camo's 2007 single Drop It.\n\n\n=== 2008–10: Above & Beyond ===\nThe duo has been releasing songs on various labels throughout 2008 to 2010, including Future Prophecies's Berzerk and Body & Soul's Nasca. More frequently, they've released multiple singles through fellow Austrian drum and bass producer and promoter DisasZt's label Mainframe Recordings. On 12 February 2010, the duo had released their debut studio album Above & Beyond through the label. The fourteen-track album includes a Mainframe Recordings compilation mix composed by DJ DisasZt himself. Camo & Krooked had then released the Edge of Mind EP on John B's label Beta Recordings ten days later. It had received DJ support from many of the biggest names in drum and bass, including Pendulum, Grooverider, DJ Fresh, Adam F, London Elektricity, Matrix & Futurebound, Shimon, Concord Dawn, and DJ SS.\nDue to Camo & Krooked's success with Above & Beyond, they won Best Newcomer DJs at the 2010 Drum & Bass Arena Awards, and put out two mixes for BBC Radio 1's Annie Nightingale, Fabio & Grooverider. Grooverider later quoted that Camo & Krooked are \"one of the biggest talents in Drum & Bass\". Both of these mixes bring to the table Camo & Krooked's usual varying subgenres of drum and bass. They have released successful remixes of drum and bass tracks such as Future Prophecies's \"September\", John B's \"Numbers\" and DJ Fresh's \"Talkbox\". They have also produced remixes for songs by English rapper Professor Green twice: one for \"Just Be Good to Green\" and another for \"Monster\". The latter remix was their first venture into the realms of dubstep, a new genre for them.\nIn April 2010, Camo & Krooked released \"Turn Up (The Music)\", featuring the vocals of Pat Fulgoni, through Hospital Records as part of the compilation album Sick Music 2. The song contains lyrics based on the song \"Turn on the Music\" by Roger Sanchez. The track was originally released on a double A-side joint single backed with Netsky's \"Memory Lane\". Their first individual single release on Hospital was \"Climax\", released on 28 June 2010. In October 2010, drum and bass producer and Shogun Audio owner DJ Friction had teamed up with Camo & Krooked to create the collaborative effort of \"Stand Up!\", featuring added vocals from Dynamite MC. Friction had also made a drum and bass remix of the Doctor P track \"Sweet Shop\" alongside the two.\nCamo & Krooked were eventually signed to Hospital Records on 4 December 2010 to join the likes of Netsky, High Contrast and Danny Byrd. By the end of 2010, they've made a huge impact on the world of drum and bass in a short period of time with releases on labels including Viper Recordings, Technique, Breakbeat Kaos, Audio Porn, Renegade Hardware, Urban Takeover and Uprising Records.\n\n\n=== 2011–12: Cross the Line and other projects ===\nRietsch and Wagner had experimented with minimal techno and house music under the alias Chrome. The duo had released the Paranoia EP, which featured six of their unreleased tracks, as a free download. In 2011, they have decided to discontinue the side-project to focus on producing drum and bass as Camo & Krooked.\nCamo & Krooked open 2011 with their two-part Pulse of Time EP released through Viper Recordings. It met the support of acts such as DJ Hype, Andy C, Danny Byrd, High Contrast, ShockOne, Netsky, Sub Focus, Chase & Status, Metrik, and Crissy Criss.\nOn 3 June 2011, Camo & Krooked released the first single from their upcoming Hospital Records debut album, \"All Fall Down\" / \"Breezeblock\". \"All Fall Down\" features the vocals of Shaz Sparks. The song is another one of their dubstep productions. It reached number 196 on the UK Singles Chart, making it Camo & Krooked's first ever charting single. It has also charted at number 40 in the UK Dance Chart and number 20 in the UK Indie Chart, and it is one of their most commercially successful singles to date.

They've performed at the Relentless Nass festival, and also at the Global Gathering festival, both in July 2011. In addition, they also headlined the Strongbow stage at the V Festival in August 2011.\nThe second single off of Camo & Krooked's untitled second album, \"Make The Call\", featuring the vocals of Bristol-based drum and bass musician TC, was released on 12 September 2011, accompanied by the AA-side track \"In the Future\" featuring Jenna G and Futurebound. \"Make the Call\" was one of their few songs produced in the style of electro house music.

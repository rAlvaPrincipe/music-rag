    "text": "JUTAUN (pronounced zha-t√°wn) is a band that began as a multi-cultural R&B male vocal group of high school friends from Monroe Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey. Brothers Jake and James Evans teamed with Anthony \"Brian\" Lewis, Peter Garcia, and Samoeun Cheng in early 1999. The father of Jake and James Evans, Jake Evans Jr., served as the group's vocal coach and mentor. He incorporated their sound with influences of classic R&B acts like The Temptations, Take 6, and Earth, Wind & Fire. As the band grew, Jake, James, and Samoeun recruited current members Stephen Honsberger, Carter Fox, Jordan Damiani, and Michael Walker.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJUTAUN got their start by performing at talent shows and shopping malls in the Philadelphia and South Jersey area. In 2003 the group members quit their day jobs to pursue music full-time. They signed with friend and manager David Still and formed Climax Entertainment which is still based in Camden, NJ. The group began developing their business in diners and parking lots, but were soon able to acquire a full office space equipped with studios and rehearsal space. JUTAUN built up a fanbase organically by performing at waterfront venues, festivals and shopping centers. They followed every major concert tour, and performed outside the venues. Through their grassroots approach, they sold over 100,000 of their self-produced CD's. Their efforts gave them some attention, and soon promoters began booking them to open for established artists. Their earliest promotional appearances include the Ebony Family Reunion concerts, Crest Latin Shows, and the Pantene Total You Tour 2006.\nMany of JUTAUN's radio singles including \"Go Slow\", \"Let Me In\", \"Beautiful\", and remake of Enchantment's \"Sunshine\" charted on internet and non-commercial stations, generating interests of mainstream audiences. JUTAUN was booked on the national BET Black College tour in the Summer and Fall of 2008 in support of educational outreach to minority students.\nIn mid-2009 JUTAUN appeared at B.B. Kings Blues Club & Grill in New York City and won \"Best Male R&B Group\" at the Underground Music Awards.

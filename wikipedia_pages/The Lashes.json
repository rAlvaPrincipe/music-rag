Goodmanson also produced their debut album, Get It, released by Columbia Records in 2006. \nOn May 5, 2007, Lashes guitarist Eric Howk fell into a 12-foot-deep (3.7 m) hole at a construction site near a friend's house and broke several vertebrae and severed his spine.  The accident left him paralyzed from the waist down. On May 17, 2007, the McLeod Residence hosted a benefit for Howk. Donations collected at the event raised money to help cover his medical bills.\nThe band continued to perform and played at Bumbershoot 2007 that September.\nThe band self-released Thank You Side A on January 1, 2008.  It was released exclusively at Sonic Boom Records and produced by John Goodmanson.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Stupid Stupid (EP) (Lookout!

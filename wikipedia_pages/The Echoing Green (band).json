    "text": "The Echoing Green is an electronic music and synthpop band. It began as a duo between Joey Belville and Aaron Bowman in 1992, and has since released eleven major albums.\n\n\n== History ==\nBelville, a devout Christian, created the band with a focus on faith and self-funding rather than having label. Their lyrics are infused with a strong element of faith and biblical themes. Christian artists also make occasional appearances. For instance, Riki Michele provided vocals on \"Defend Your Joy\", though she was uncredited for the part.  Supernova managed to gain a label and recognition, the band mostly works with word of mouth.\nA remix of the song \"Oxygen\" from Hope Springs Eternal appeared on the Sci-Fi Channel's show First Wave.\nOn February 21, 2011, the band announced their completion of mastering on In Scarlet and Vile, which later went to release on March 11, 2011.\nBelville has produced and mixed other bands such as Leiahdorus and System22.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nDefend Your Joy (1994)\nHope Springs Eternal (1997)\nThe Echoing Green / The W's Split EP (1998)\nThe Echoing Green (1998)\nSupernova (2000)\nMusic from the Ocean Picture (2001)\nThe Winter of Our Discontent (2003)\nIn Scarlet and Vile (2011)\n\n\n=== Remix albums ===\nAurora 7.2 (1995)\nScience Fiction (1996) (re-issued in 2001)\nThe Evergreen Annex - Remix Addendum (2002)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nGlimmer of Hope (1999) (Recorded Live At TOM Fest '98)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nElectronica (1998)\nOceanaria v1.0 (2000)\nThe Evergreen Collection (2002)\nSongs of Innocence and Experience - Hope and Science (2006 reissue of Hope Springs Eternal and Science Fiction)\nThe Echoing Green - Violent Whispers- Songs & Secrets from The Echoing Green (Compilation, best-of album 2020)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"If I Could...\" (1999)\n\"She's Gone Tragic\" (2000)\n\"Fall Awake\" (2003)\n\"The Story of Our Lives\" (2004)\n\"Suffer\" (2007)\n\"Sanctuary\" (2008)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Echoing Green discography at MusicBrainz"

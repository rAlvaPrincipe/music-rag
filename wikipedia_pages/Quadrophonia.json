    "text": "Quadrophonia were a Dutch/Belgian electronic music collective, formed by Olivier Abbeloos (also known as part of T99) and Lucien Foort in the late 1980s, with several of their tracks performed by Marvin D (Marvin Tholen).  \nThey had two top 40 hits in the United Kingdom. \"Quadrophonia\", which reached #14 in April 1991, followed by \"The Wave of the Future\", which charted at number 40 in July of the same year. Three of their other singles were \"Find the Time (Part 1)\", \"Schizofrenia – The Worst Day of My Life\" and \"The Man with the Masterplan\", all three of which were not successful. Later in the year the group released their only album, Cozmic Jam. Following their work in 1991 and 1992, Quadrophonia went on to release three more singles in 1993. They were \"Intergalactic Crosstalk (Amazonia)\", \"Moondance\" and \"Warp Factor One\"; as well as a couple of remix singles in 1997 and 1998,  called \"Quadrophonia '97 (Remixes Part 1)\" and \"Quadrophonia '98 (Remixes Part 2)\".\nQuadrophonia also recorded under the aliases CMOS, Holographic Hallucination, and Warp Factor 1 (as well as Orion on one white label release).\nMarvin D ultimately introduced his friend Ray Slijngaard to Phil Wilde and Jean-Paul de Coster, who together with Anita Doth later formed 2 Unlimited.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Charted singles ===\n\n\n=== Other singles ===\n\"Schizofrenia – The Worst Day of My Life\" (1991)\n\"The Man with the Master Mixes\" (\"The Man With the Masterplan\") (1992)\n\"Intergalactic Crosstalk (Amazonia)\" (1993)\n\"Moondance\" (1993)\n\"Warp Factor One\" (1993)\n\"Encounters of the Underground\" (1993) – released as Holographic Hallucination\n\"Dark Tales of X-Perimental Madness\" (1993) – released as Holographic Hallucination\n\"Hypno\" (1994) – released as Holographic Hallucination\n\"Care 4 Me\" (1994) – released as Warp Factor 1\n\"People (Don't Make Me Wait)\" (1994) – Released as Warp Factor 1\n\"Warp Factor One\" (1995) – released as CMOS (note: This is a different single from the previous \"Warp Factor One\" single the group released under their Quadrophonia name)\n\"Quadrophonia '97 (Remixes Part 1)\" (1997)\n\"Quadrophonia '98 (Remixes Part 2)\" (1998)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nQuadrophonia at Discogs\nOlivier Abbeloos' Official Website\nLucien Foort's Official Website\nOlivier Abbeloos on Soundcloud"

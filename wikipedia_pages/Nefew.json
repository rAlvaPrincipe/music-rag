    "text": "Nefew (stylised as NEFEW) is a multicultural hip hop group currently based in Switzerland. It consists of Polemikk (MC, producer) and PA-Double (DJ, producer). Nefew is an acronym which stands for New Enlightenment From Every Word. Q Magazine describes Nefew as one of the most promising hip hop acts from Europe. The duo is represented by independent label On Our Feet Ent. and Puma.\nNEFEW's musical style is often compared to artists such as Common, Kanye West, 9th Wonder, Kenn Starr and Talib Kweli. Many of the group's productions contain soulful samples, as well as jazz keys and string arrangements.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2007–2010: First album and Puma deal ===\nAfter changing their name to NEFEW, the group took their first big step in 2007, releasing their debut studio album called Off the Cuff, which contains the track Admit It, a collaboration with Brooklyn rappers Wordsworth and Masta Ace. The album received mixed reviews from music critics. musicOMH gave it 2 out of 5 stars, while UK Hip Hop calls it a \"well-intentioned if unsurprising slice of underground rap\".\nIn December 2009, Puma began to support NEFEW in the matter of promotion. This allowed the independent duo to reach a much higher number of fans. Nefew are the first hip hop act to be endorsed by the company.\nAlso, Nefew revealed in several interviews that they were negotiating with two major labels. Yet, no record deal is official.\nWith Puma supporting the group, however, NEFEW released an EP. It was available only on iTunes Music Store. The track Biko features R&B singer Chanj and former GOOD Music signee Consequence, and held number two position in the US College Radio Charts.\n\n\n=== 2010–2014: Antihero trilogy ===\nAntihero Begins came out in April 2010 as a free mixtape. The record had considerable success, not least of all because it was published on highly respected hip hop blog 2dopeboyz.com. Also, Antihero Begins received general acclaim from music critics. Okayplayer gave it 89 out of 100 points:\n\nThe title track, the albums curtain call, is an appropriately optimistic celebration of the journey thus far. It is self-celebratory testimony to the group’s determination and initiative. This open-ended finale observes all the attributes that make the groups journey alluring and heroic. And it is the perfect ending for a sequel, something I am excited to hear.\nAfter Antihero Begins DJ Green Lantern took notice of the groups work and came up with the idea of a collaboration. In January 2011, Man Vs Many, which is hosted by DJ Green Lantern, was released. Among others, the mixtape features soul singer Dwele and Rapper Nottz. The album was later re-released as a digital album. In October 2011, Nefew released the EP Transitions with German producer 7inch. The EP \"For Hip Hop\", a collaboration with Nottz and Shakes, followed in 2012.\nThe most recent studio album is called Rise of the Antihero (released in November 2014). It features various notable artists such as BJ the Chicago Kid, Jared Evan and STS Gold. The album peaked at No. 37 on the Swiss album charts. Nefew intends to release another studio album (The Antihero), concluding the Antihero trilogy.\n\n\n=== 2015–present: Empire deal ===\nNefew joined forces with record label Empire in 2016. Shortly thereafter, Slides EP was released.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nNefew on SoundCloud"

However, judge Louis Walsh suggested that they re-audition, with the group originally containing member Sisi Jghalef. After reaching the judges' homes stage and being told that they had made it through to the top twelve, it emerged that Jghalef had an outstanding criminal conviction. This went against the rules of the competition and the show's producers asked her to leave the group. On 3, 17 and 24 November, they were in the bottom two but were saved by the judges on the first two occasions, and by the public vote on the other (due to the result going to deadlock). Hope were eliminated in the quarter-final by public vote.\n\n\n== After The X Factor ==\nSince leaving the show, Hope have performed at various events around the UK including The Birmingham Clothes Show and have booked their first international date in Dubai.

She performs with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\"Emerald Tiger\" is a composition by Riverdance's Whelan, an Irish/Asian fusion. \"Raga's Dance\", by Indian Composer A. R. Rahman, is a piece that mixes Carnatic instruments and vocals to a large symphonic orchestration. \"Bolero for Violin and Orchestra\" is a tribute to Ravel's Boléro, and features a darbuka. \"Tribal Gathering\" is a minimalist composition in the vein of John Adams but with a live Afro percussion rhythm beneath. \"Bolero\", \"Tango de los Exilados\", and \"Tribal Gathering\" were composed by the European composer Walter Taieb (The Alchemist's Symphony).

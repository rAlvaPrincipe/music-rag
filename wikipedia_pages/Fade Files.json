    "text": "Fade Files is a Welsh electronic pop group based in Cardiff, Wales. Its members are Richard Griffiths (from Cardiff), Stefan Schmid (from Fribourg, Switzerland) and producer Mark Hopgood, from London. The group started in 2012 when Richard and Stefan began to demo songs together in Switzerland and Wales. Inspired initially by The Postal Serviceâ€™s method of working from different parts of the country, their collaboration continued over the Internet. Mark joined in 2014, and the group writes and produces their music together in Switzerland, London or Wales, or sometimes by swapping files online. Their first single \"Byth yn Dod Lawr\" was produced in collaboration with Kris Jenkins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2016: Single - Byth Yn Dod Lawr ===\nRelease date: 17 May 2016\nA Side - Byth Yn Dod Lawr\nB Side - Let It Come Down (free download)\nByth Yn Dod Lawr was awarded \"Trac Yr Wythnos\" ( track of the week ) by BBC Radio Cymru on the week commencing 6 June 2016.\nLink: BBC Radio Cymru Playlist\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nRichard Griffiths: Vocals, keyboards\nMark Hopgood: Keyboards, harmonies\nStefan Schmid: Vocals, keyboards\n\n\n=== Occasional additional members ===\nAndy Taylor: Guitars\nOncle Gilbert: Samples\nDavid K.

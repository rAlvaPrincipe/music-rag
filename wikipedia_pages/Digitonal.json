    "text": "Digitonal is a British electronica duo composed of clarinettist and composer Andy Dobson and violinist Samy Bishai, who formed the band in London in the late 1990s.\nReviewing their 2010 retrospective album Be Still My Bleeping Heart, BBC's Mike Diver agrees with the band's description of their own style as \"neo classical ambient electronica\", adding that, although at times predictable, their music is \"extremely accessible, and incredibly pretty\", \"designed primarily to calm, despite occasionally boisterous beat-work.\" The Skinny described the duo's sound as akin to Philip Glass and The Orb.\nBen Weisz from musicOMH summarises Digitonal's work by saying that \"while the rest of the world spent the noughties lurching from one musical fad to the next, Digitonal quietly created some of the most beautifully-constructed art of the decade. Alex Macpherson, from The Guardian, describes their music as \"suited to accompanying a book, a dinner or a hangover [...] Very much atmosphere over action, but not necessarily a bad thing.\"\nIn 2016 Andrew Dobson was interviewed by the Data.Wave webzine.\nThe group announced an indefinite hiatus on their website in 2023.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n23 Things Fall Apart (2002) \nThe Centre Cannot Hold EP (2004)\nLive At The Oxygen Bar (2005)\nSave Your Light For Darker Days (2008)\nBe Still My Bleeping Heart (2010)\nBeautiful Broken (2015)\nSet The Weather Fair (2020)\n\n\n== References =="

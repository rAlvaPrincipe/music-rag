    "text": "Netto Houz or Netto is a Berlin-based house music project formed by Ralf Zimmermann and Markus Wegner in 1994.\nIn the second half of the 1990s Netto Houz appeared alongside projects like Whirlpool Productions on Ladomat 2000, the dance and electronic music department of L'Age D'Or, which was one of the record labels that had evolved from the Hamburg indie music scene known as Hamburger Schule.\nAt first, Netto Houz was heavily influenced by the tracky sound of Chicago labels like Relief Records or Dance Mania, but developed a deeper musical style over the years. Because of the strong Disco and Deep House references of their 1998 Album Room 7107 the duo helped to pave the way for the revival of these genres in the Berlin club scene of the 2000s.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Album ===\nNetto Houz: Room 7107.

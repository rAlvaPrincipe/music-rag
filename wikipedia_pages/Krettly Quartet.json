    "text": "The Krettly Quartet was a French string quartet musical ensemble active during the 1920s and 1930s. Its repertoire included avant-garde and modern works, and the group made early recordings of some of these.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n1st violin\n\nRobert Krettly\n2nd violin\n\nRené Costard (retired 1935)\nviola\n\nGeorges Taine (active 1925)\nFrançois Broos (active 1931-35)\n'cello\n\nPierre Fournier (before 1929)\nAndré Navarra (1929–1935)\n\n\n== Origins and activities ==\nThe quartet took its name from the leader, the violinist Robert Krettly (b. 1891), who was the brother of the cellist Odette Krettly (one of the teachers of Pierre Fournier (1906–1986)).\nRobert Krettly took part in the premiere of the Gabriel Fauré Pianoforte Trio in D minor op 120, in Paris on May 12, 1923, with Jacques Patté (cello) and Tatiana Sanzévitch (piano). The quartet was in existence in March 1925, with Fournier as its cellist aged 19, when they premiered the string quartet by Catherine Murphy Urner at the Salle Pleyel, Paris. This formation therefore preceded the appearance of Robert Krettly as second violin, with Jacques Thibaud (1st violin), Maurice Vieux (1884–1951) (viola) and André Hekking (cello), in the premiere of the Gabriel Fauré string quartet (in E minor, op 121) at the Société Nationale de Musique in Paris on 12 June 1925. Fournier had also studied with André Hekking, and with Lucien Capet.\nIn 1929 Andre Navarra (1911–1988) replaced Pierre Fournier as cellist, and by 1931 François Broos had replaced Georges Taine at the viola desk. Navarra made his debut as a soloist in 1931, at the Concerts Colonne in Paris. Both Navarra and René Costard retired from the group in 1935, and in that year Costard established the French branch of Foldex maps.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nThe Krettly Quartet made some significant recordings before 1936, including principally:\n\nGabriel Fauré, String Quartet in E minor op 121,\nMaurice Ravel, String Quartet in F major,\nArthur Honegger, String Quartet,\nDarius Milhaud, String Quartet no 2 (Atonal),\nAlexander Borodin, String Quartet no 3, Notturno\nIgor Strawinsky, Trois piéces pour quatuor a cordes\n\n\n== Notes and references =="

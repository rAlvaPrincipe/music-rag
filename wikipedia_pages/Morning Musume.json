    "text": "Morning Musume '24 (モーニング娘。 '24, Mōningu Musume Two-Four.), formerly and commonly known as Morning Musume (モーニング娘。, Mōningu Musume.) and colloquially referred to as Momusu (モー娘。, Mōmusu.), is a Japanese girl group, holding the second highest overall single sales (of a female group) on the Oricon charts as of February 2012, with the Oricon record of most top-ten singles, having 64 of them.\nMorning Musume was formed in 1997 by rock singer-songwriter turned record producer Tsunku, who later composed the vast majority of the group's songs over the decade. They are the lead group of Hello! Project that specialises in upbeat, pop-oriented music coupled with dance performance. The group produced several splinter groups, and often collaborates with other Hello! Project acts, including Country Musume, Berryz Kobo, Cute, Melon Kinenbi, and V-u-den. The group's name can be translated as \"Morning Girls\" or \"Morning Daughters\"; it consists of members mostly in their late adolescence and early 20s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1997-1998: Formation and beginnings ===\nJapanese producer Tsunku started the group in 1997 through an audition for a female rock vocalist for his band Sharam Q. The audition was held on the Japanese TV show Asayan. The winner was Michiyo Heike, later to become a soloist under what would eventually become known as Hello! Project. Tsunku decided to form a girl group consisting of five of the runners-up: Natsumi Abe, Yuko Nakazawa, Kaori Iida, Asuka Fukuda, and Aya Ishiguro. They were issued a challenge to sell 50,000 copies of their demo single, \"Ai no Tane\", with just five days of promotion events. They managed the feat in four promotion days (spread out over November 1997) in a very grassroots manner, and Tsunku began his mission to create the most famous all-girl group in Japan.\nIn early 1998, the girls were ready with their first official single, \"Morning Coffee\". The success of this single (hitting number six on the Japanese pop charts) brought them three new members known as the second generation: Kei Yasuda, Mari Yaguchi, and Sayaka Ichii, bringing the total member count to eight. The second single, \"Summer Night Town\", was the first single of the new lineup—a mature pop tune about unsuccessfully attempting to hide one's true feelings. Their third single, \"Daite Hold on Me!\", continued in the same vein musically as Summer Night Town, and managed to hit number one on the charts. Leader Nakazawa also started her solo career.\n\"First Time\" was released in July 1998, featuring the singles \"Ai no Tane\", \"Morning Coffee\" and \"Summer Night Town\".\nThat year, Tsunku also formed Tanpopo, the first subgroup of Morning Musume, with Kaori Iida, Aya Ishiguro, and Mari Yaguchi. Tanpopo touted slower, more mature songs.\nWhen \"Morning Coffee\" was released, however, Morning Musume's label Zetima went by a different name, One Up Music (One Up is a combination of Warner Music Japan (the label that distributed One Up Music's catalog) and Up-Front Group (One Up Music's parent company)). However, in April 1998, one month before the release of \"Summer Night Town\", One Up Music ended its distribution deal with Warner, and was rebranded as Zetima when it merged with Y.J. Sounds (another former Up-Front Group-affiliated label). Distribution rights would be given to Sony Music Japan's sub label Epic Records for \"Summer Night Town\", \"First Time\", and all of Zetima's subsequent releases.\n\n\n=== 1999: Commercial success with \"Love Machine\" and the 3rd Generation ===\nThe group released its fourth single \"Memory Seishun no Hikari\" in early 1999, reaching number two on Oricon, second to Glay's \"Winter, Again\" which had first week sales of 955,780 copies.\nThe song features rap passages by L The Headtoucha and intense vocal harmonization by the group's members. This was Asuka Fukuda's last single with Morning Musume; Asuka claimed that she was leaving in order to focus on her studies, only to drop out of school soon after.\n\"Manatsu no Kōsen\" was released in May and went to number three on the charts. Their sixth single, \"Furusato\", was released in July.\nSecond Morning was released in July 1999, and contained the singles \"Daite Hold on Me!\", \"Memory Seishun no Hikari\", \"Manatsu no Kōsen\", and \"Furusato\". \"Daite Hold on Me!\" and \"Manatsu no Kōsen\" were remixed.\nTsunku held auditions for the third generation of Morning Musume, and Maki Goto was added. Goto was 13, the youngest member of Morning Musume at the time. The group's seventh single, \"Love Machine\", sold 1,760,000 copies, making it a major hit; it is still their highest-selling single as of 2012. It was Maki Goto's first single and Aya Ishiguro's last.\nGoto was paired with Kei Yasuda and Sayaka Ichii to form the subgroup Petitmoni (also known as Pucchi Moni). Petitmoni's first single, \"Chokotto Love\", sold over 1,123,610 copies.\n\n\n=== 2000: Koi no Dance Site, continued commercial success and the 4th Generation ===\n\"Koi no Dance Site\" was released in early 2000, reaching number two and selling over a million copies—400,000 away from reaching \"Love Machine\"'s success. The single had the highest 1st week sales than any other Morning Musume's singles, an enormous amount of 600,860 copies. Even with this large number, the single did not reach number one because Southern All Stars's biggest hit single, Tsunami, which sold total of 2.93 million copies, was released at the same date as Koi no Dance Site. Aya Ishiguro left the group before the single was released in order to marry Shinya, drummer of visual kei rock band Luna Sea, leaving the group with seven members.\nThe second event of 2000 was the creation of \"shuffle units\", in which all members of Tsunku's then 16-member family, Hello! Project, were shuffled around to form three one-time groups: Akagumi 4, Kiiro 5, and Aoiro 7. The idea was to battle for the highest single sales. This was achieved by Akagumi 4 which boasted Maki Goto as the lead vocals.\nIn March, their third studio album, 3rd: Love Paradise was released. Despite having \"Love Machine\" and \"Koi no Dance Site\" on its track list, it did not manage to claim the number one spot, but did sell more than 800,000 copies, making it Morning Musume's highest-selling studio album to date.\nThis year also brought a new generation search. The fourth generation consisted of Rika Ishikawa, Hitomi Yoshizawa, Nozomi Tsuji, and Ai Kago, lending a completely different feel to the group by adding the 12-year-old duo of Tsuji and Kago. After their debut single, \"Happy Summer Wedding\", (continuing the legacy of number one hits with 1,370,000 copies sold,) Sayaka Ichii left to pursue her own music career. She became the vocalist of Japanese group Cubic Cross and later married fellow member Naoki Yoshizawa (no relation to Hitomi Yoshizawa).\nWith Ishiguro and Ichii gone, both Tanpopo and Petitmoni revised their lineups—Hitomi Yoshizawa joined Petitmoni, and Ai Kago and Rika Ishikawa were added to Tanpopo. Meanwhile, Mari Yaguchi had started performing informally with Ai Kago and Nozomi Tsuji in concerts as Mini Moni, a group tailored towards younger audiences with all the members being less than 150 cm (about 5 ft) tall. Mika Todd of Coconuts Musume was later added into the group and Tsunku made them official. Their debut single, \"Minimoni Jankenpyon!\", was a number one hit on the Oricon.\nAs an idol group, they were extremely successful, drawing comparisons to the popularity of former girl idol group Speed. \"I Wish\" and \"Renai Revolution 21\" (Yuko Nakazawa's last single) continued the trend of happy pop songs becoming staple hits for the group. Morning Musume also began their tradition of performing in musicals each year, breaking new ground as idols with their musical Love Century: Yume wa Minakerya Hajimaranai.\n\n\n=== 2001: \"The Peace\" and the 5th Generation ===\nIn April 2001, group leader Yuko Nakazawa left to focus on her solo career (stating her age as a factor as well—she felt it was limiting her ability to meet the physical demands of the group's activities) making Kaori Iida and Kei Yasuda Morning Musume's co-leaders. During this time, Rika Ishikawa was \"lent\" out to the rather inactive group, Country Musume. She did not officially join, but participated as a feature singers in number of their singles.\nBy July 2001 the string of number one hits had yet to be broken with the release of the single \"The Peace!\". The Peace! features a distinctive call and response chants, with Rika Ishikawa as the center focus.\nBritish newspaper The Guardian described the promotional video echoed the song's \"strangeness\" by placing the group in the middle of what appeared to be a gigantic public bathroom, displaying the girls dancing amongst the urinals and posing for photographs in the stalls; supposedly as a response to hidden camera footage of the members that had recently surfaced, filmed from a toilet in their production offices.\nAt the end of January 2001, the best selling Hello! Project album to date was released: Best! Morning Musume 1. It sold 2,259,510 copies. It featured 15 tracks, the only original song being \"Say Yeah! -Motto Miracle Night-\".\nAt the end of 2001, four new members joined the group as the fifth generation through the audition \"Love Audition 21:\" Ai Takahashi, Asami Konno, Makoto Ogawa, and Risa Niigaki, bringing the roster to 13 girls. Their first single \"Mr. Moonlight: Ai no Big Band\", (done in the style of big band) featured fourth generation member Hitomi Yoshizawa as the central focus and main vocalist of the song.\n\n\n=== 2002 : Maki Goto's departure and massive re-structuring of the sub-units ===\nIn February, \"Sōda! We're Alive\", another hit, was released. It featured many different styles combined into one song, centered on Mari Yaguchi.\nIn July 2002, \"Do It! Now\" was released. This single finally broke the line of number one hits and came in at number three—a surprising fact to many, considering it was Maki Goto's last single.\nMorning Musume's fourth studio album, 4th Ikimasshoi! was released in March 2002 after a two-year wait. It is the first studio album from the group to reach number one on Oricon. It featured the singles \"Renai Revolution 21\", (rerecorded with the current 13-person formation,) \"The Peace!\", (in a 'full', longer version,) \"Mr. Moonlight: Ai no Big Band\", (with added dialog at the beginning,) and \"Sōda! We're Alive\".\nLate 2002 was marked by the graduation of Maki Goto and a mass re-shuffle of the sub-units. Tsunku removed Kaori Iida, Mari Yaguchi, and Ai Kago from Tanpopo, adding in Asami Konno, Risa Niigaki, and Ayumi Shibata of Melon Kinenbi to join Rika Ishikawa. Tanpopo only released one single with this lineup before the group was put on an indefinite hiatus status. Makoto Ogawa and Ayaka Kimura of Coconuts Musume joined Hitomi Yoshizawa in Petitmoni to replace Kei Yasuda and Maki Goto, but the group did not even release a single, only performing in concerts. Their song \"Wow Wow Wow\" was later released on the Hello! Project's compilation CD Petit Best 4. In Mini Moni, Mari Yaguchi was replaced by Ai Takahashi and the new lineup went on to put out several singles and a second album until member Mika Todd left in May 2004, adding Mini Moni to the list of \"indefinite hiatus\" subgroups.\nIn October \"Koko ni Iruzee!\" was released, a fast-paced, feel-good song about making the most of life and music's ability to unite the world. It was number one on Oricon.\n\n\n=== 2003: 6th Generation debut and sub-groups ===\nThe unique childlike tune \"Morning Musume no Hyokkori Hyōtanjima\" was released in February 2003 as the group's seventeenth single. It is significant because it was a cover song, marking the first time Tsunku did not write a single's lyrics.\nApril brought the notably successful single \"As for One Day\"—a synthesizer-driven song about lost love—which sold 129,893 copies and hit number one in Oricon charts, and was the last time a Morning Musume single hit number one until \"Aruiteru\" (released late 2006). This single was the last for Kei Yasuda.\nBefore the auditions for the sixth generation were held, the group released the album No. 5. It was unique in a few ways. It was the last studio album to feature Kei Yasuda and Natsumi Abe as full members of the group. It was also the first Morning Musume studio album to feature a former member, as Maki Goto guests on \"Megami (Mousse na Yasashisa)\" and \"Ganbacchae!\". It only featured two singles: \"Do It! Now\" and \"Koko ni Iruzee!\".\nIn mid-2003, four new girls were added as the sixth generation: Miki Fujimoto, Eri Kamei, Sayumi Michishige, and Reina Tanaka. Eri Kamei, Sayumi Michishige, and Reina Tanaka successfully passed the traditional auditions; however, Miki Fujimoto was a solo singer in Hello!Project at the time. After appearing on the New Year's music program \"Kōhaku Uta Gassen\" with several Morning Musume members dancing as backup, Tsunku added her as part of the sixth generation.\nThe sixth generation's first single was \"Shabondama\", which featured \"break-up\" lyrics, a seemingly spontaneous dance routine, and rolled \"r\"s.\nMari Yaguchi became Morning Musume's sub-leader after Kei's departure and was also put in charge of training and assisting the trainee group of Hello! Project Kids, eventually forming a group with five of them, known as ZYX.\nLater in 2003, Morning Musume was split into two subgroups so that it could tour more cities (especially smaller cities that could not support a 15-member troupe). Morning Musume Sakuragumi, which focused on slower and more traditional love songs, included Natsumi Abe, Mari Yaguchi, Hitomi Yoshizawa, Ai Kago, Ai Takahashi, Risa Niigaki, Asami Konno and Eri Kamei. Morning Musume Otomegumi, which had more upbeat pop songs with a slight rock flavor, featured Kaori Iida, Rika Ishikawa, Nozomi Tsuji, Makoto Ogawa, Miki Fujimoto, Sayumi Michishige, and Reina Tanaka. Sakuragumi released two singles: \"Hare Ame Nochi Suki\" and \"Sakura Mankai\", and Otomegumi released two singles as well: \"Ai no Sono: Touch My Heart!\" and \"Yūjō: Kokoro no Busu ni wa Naranee!\".\nThe last single of Morning Musume in 2003 to feature the entire group was \"Go Girl: Koi no Victory\", which had the members girlishly proclaiming the victory of their love.\n\n\n=== 2004: Nozomi Tsuji and Ai Kago's graduation ===\nIn January 2004, Natsumi Abe (known as \"the face of Morning Musume\" to the general public) left to pursue a soloist career. Her last single was \"Ai Araba It's All Right\", Morning Musume's last song to sell more than 100,000 copies until 'One Two Three / The Matenrou Show'. \"Ai Araba It's All Right\" had uplifting lyrics and a cheery dance sequence.\nThe group soon released another single, \"Roman: My Dear Boy\". The song showcased an almost rock flavor and centered its lyrics around offering \"a dance\" to a boy. This was followed by their twenty-third single, \"Joshi Kashimashi Monogatari\", which is unique in that it was actually about the Morning Musume girls themselves—each member got a verse about their personality. This song would later be remade several times as \"Joshi Kashimashi Monogatari 2\" and \"Joshi Kashimashi Monogatari 3\", included in their sixth and seventh album respectively. This single also marked the leaving of fourth-generation members Nozomi Tsuji and Ai Kago in August, to focus on \"W\", their new duo group.\nIn April 2004, Rika Ishikawa was caught in a rare scandal, as an audio recording revealed her saying of the group's fans at a show, \"look at them. Grownups screaming like that! I can't believe it. So stupid!\" \nIn mid-2004, Morning Musume's second best-of album, Best! Morning Musume 2 was released and featured \"Yah! Aishitai\" as the only new track. It had a lukewarm reception at best, compared to their first best-of compilation.\nAuditions for the seventh generation (named \"Lucky 7\" to commemorate the seventh generation, the seventh year of Morning Musume, and seven audition sites across Japan) were held in various Japan cities in late 2004, resulting in six finalists. However, on January 9, 2005, Tsunku surprised everyone by announcing that no one in the Lucky 7 audition would be added to Morning Musume, citing that he had set his expectations extra-high this year in hopes of finding an \"ace\". This was the first time an audition had ended with no new members.\nIn November 2004, Morning Musume released \"Namida ga Tomaranai Hōkago\", a ballad that featured Asami Konno, Miki Fujimoto, Sayumi Michishige, and Rika Ishikawa.\nFollowing this single Morning Musume Early Single Box was released. It was a 9-CD set containing their first eight singles with a bonus track on each one, as well as a karaoke CD of some of their more popular tunes from the early years.\nFinally, at the end of 2004, the group's yearly album was released. Their sixth studio album, named Ai no Dai 6 Kan, hit stores in December. It contained three singles: \"Roman: My Dear Boy\", \"Joshi Kashimashi Monogatari\", and \"Namida ga Tomaranai Hōkago\". This was Ai Kago, Nozomi Tsuji, Kaori Iida, Mari Yaguchi, and Rika Ishikawa's last credited studio album.\n\n\n=== 2005: 7th Generation \"Miracle\" Member, Mari Yaguchi's dismissal and Kaori Iida's and Rika Ishikawa's graduation ===\nOn January 30, 2005, then-leader and the last member from the first generation Kaori Iida left to pursue a solo singer/artist career, with Mari Yaguchi taking on leadership role with Hitomi Yoshizawa as subleader. Her last single was \"The Manpower!!!\", which sung about the abilities of the human race and was also the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles theme song. The beginning of 2005 also saw the beginning of Musume Document 2005, which covered behind-the-scenes material, historical footage, and interviews.\nIn February 2005, Tsunku started another audition for Morning Musume's seventh generation. He noted that he was still intent on finding an \"ace\". This audition resulted with Koharu Kusumi finally being chosen as the sole \"miracle\" member of the new generation.\nOn April 10, 2005, photos were taken of Mari Yaguchi with Shun Oguri (scheduled to be published in a gossip magazine Friday! on the 15th). On April 14, 2005, Yaguchi announced that she would \"retire\" from Morning Musume and would continue on with solo activities. In her public statement, Yaguchi said that due to the scandal and its publicity, she could no longer sustain an \"idol\" image befitting of Morning Musume. Because of the nature of her departure, Yaguchi did not receive a leaving concert. Sub-leader Hitomi Yoshizawa took over as the leader of Morning Musume, and Miki Fujimoto became sub-leader as of July 15, 2005.\nJust days after Yaguchi resigned, on April 27, 2005, the group's twenty-sixth single, \"Osaka Koi no Uta\" was released. The final version featured Yaguchi still, presumably because they did not have enough time to rerecord and remix it. The lyrics are in an Osaka dialect. This single was also Rika Ishikawa's last. She left on May 7, 2005, to assume full-time leadership of the Hello! Project trio known as v-u-den.\nKusumi's first single with Morning Musume was July's \"Iroppoi Jirettai\", a flamenco styled song, which was considered to be the biggest hit of the year—selling around 20,000 more copies than anything else. A 3 city handshake event was organized for the promotion of this single.\nMorning Musume's last single of 2005 was \"Chokkan 2: Nogashita Sakana wa Ōkiizo!\", which was a remake of a previous album-only song about the importance of using your intuition and not taking good things for granted. \"Koi wa Hassō Do The Hustle!\" was going to be the title track for the single, but due to poor preview results, became the coupling track instead.\nOn December 31, 2005, former Morning Musume members Mari Yaguchi, Kaori Iida, Natsumi Abe, Yuko Nakazawa, Ai Kago, Nozomi Tsuji, Rika Ishikawa, Maki Goto, and Kei Yasuda joined the current lineup of Morning Musume to perform the group's signature hit \"Love Machine\" on the 2005/2006 edition of Kōhaku Uta Gassen. The performance was Yaguchi's first since leaving Morning Musume eight and a half months earlier.\n\n\n=== 2006: Asami Konno and Makoto Ogawa's graduation ===\nOn January 16, 2006, it was announced that Morning Musume had won a Kanagawa Image Up Award in recognition of Hello! Project's support of an anti-pollution campaign. Yoshizawa, Fujimoto, and Takahashi represented the group to accept the award.\nIn February, the group released their seventh studio album, Rainbow 7. It was the first album for Kusumi and the last for Konno and Ogawa. The album features \"The Manpower!!!\", \"Osaka Koi no Uta\", \"Iroppoi Jirettai\", and \"Chokkan 2: Nogashita Sakana wa Ōkiizo!\" (in a remixed form). Kaori Iida, Rika Ishikawa and Mari Yaguchi are not credited anywhere in the liner notes although their vocals appear. Three of the songs on the album are performed by smaller clusters of several group members, and are credited in the liner notes to the featured members involved, rather than to the entire group.\nIn March 2006, \"Sexy Boy: Soyokaze ni Yorisotte\" was released. It featured an easy-to-learn dance and a parapara style. It was considered to be a relative success.\nOn April 28, 2006, it was announced by Tsunku from his official website that fifth-generation members Asami Konno and Makoto Ogawa would be leaving the group. Konno graduated on July 23, 2006, to attend University and Ogawa left on August 27, 2006, to study English abroad. Both left Morning Musume, but only Konno left Hello! Project entirely; Ogawa intended to return after completing her studies. However, as of 2007, Konno returned to Hello! Project to join the new group Ongaku Gatas, making it the first time ever that a girl who left Hello! Project actually returned. Ogawa, on the other hand, returned in June 2008 by appearing on an episode of Morning Musume's television show Haromoni@.\nKonno and Ogawa's last single was \"Ambitious! Yashinteki de Ii Jan\", which, yet again, featured a parapara type arrangement, with a rock 'n' roll flair. It was the group's 30th single, and a limited-edition CD of all past 30 singles mixed into a thirteen-minute track was included on the first pressing. Unfortunately, sales did not meet the hype, and Ambitious! clocked in as Morning Musume's lowest-selling single yet.\nIn mid-2006, the group performed the musical Ribbon no Kishi. Ai Takahashi took the main role; the secondary role was played by alternating members. There was also a mini-concert at the end of each performance, which served as Ogawa's real \"leaving concert\"—the Wonderful Hearts 2006 concert was initially intended for Konno's departure only, although Ogawa wore a special outfit and read her leaving comments as well. As for Ribbon no Kishi, an album with a selection of songs was released: Ribbon no Kishi The Musical Song Selection.\nIn mid-2006, Tsunku announced the audition for the eighth generation, called Morning Musume Happy 8 Audition. The audition started on August 27, 2006, and ended in Tokyo on October 22, 2006. On December 10, 2006's Hello! Morning, it was announced that the only new member was Aika Mitsui. The show had a piece of audition footage each week leading up to December 10, 2006.\nThe last single release in 2006 was \"Aruiteru\", which was a huge hit. It was the first single at the number one spot after 3½ years (their last number one hit being \"As for One Day\".) The song's lyrics were credited for its success, with lines like \"walking, you're not alone because everyone's here with you, praying for peace\". It was a bit of a turn from the hyperactive singles the group had been releasing. Tsunku's group, Sharan Q, also made a rock cover of this song.\nTheir first mini-album, 7.5 Fuyu Fuyu Morning Musume Mini!, was released in December. It featured five tracks by solo and/or smaller combinations of group members. It also featured the single \"Aruiteru\".\n\n\n=== 2007: 8th Generation debut, Hitomi Yoshizawa's graduation and Miki Fujimoto's dismissal ===\nIn early 2007, Morning Musume Tanjō 10nen Kinentai, a unit consisting of Kaori Iida, Natsumi Abe, Maki Goto, Risa Niigaki, and Koharu Kusumi, was created to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Morning Musume. They released a commemorative single called \"Bokura ga Ikiru My Asia\". The members chosen symbolize the beginning of the group; how they had five members ranging in age from 14 to 24. Additionally, each member was from an odd-numbered generation (Kaori Iida and Natsumi Abe from the first generation, Maki Goto from the third, Risa Niigaki from the fifth, and Koharu Kusumi from the seventh).\nOn January 2, 2007, an announcement was made during Hello! Project's 2007 Winter concert that the group's leader at the time Hitomi Yoshizawa would leave Morning Musume on May 6, 2007, the last day of Morning Musume's 2007 spring tour. The concert would take place at the Saitama Super Arena in Yoshizawa's hometown.\nIn February, the first single with the eighth generation member Aika Mitsui was released, \"Egao Yes Nude\". This was the first PV of Morning Musume to appear on the Dohhh!Up site (a streaming website of Hello! Project media). The single went up against tougher competition than \"Aruiteru\" had, only landing them a number four spot, although it sold relatively the same number of copies. The song has a funky, disco feel, and is highly reminiscent of some of the older songs of Morning Musume, most notably Summer Night Town.\nOn the March 11, 2007, edition of the weekly TV show Hello! Morning, producer Tsunku revealed he would make an important announcement in the following episode. Several days later, on March 15, he announced that two other eighth generation members would be joining the group—Li Chun and Qian Lin, both Chinese nationals, were to join as \"exchange students\". Tsunku stated the two new members would be an important key for their group's planned expansion into Asia and gave them the stage names \"Jun Jun\" and \"Lin Lin\" respectively. The two made their stage debut on May 6, at Saitama Super Arena. They were the first non-Japanese members of the group. On March 21, 2007, the group's eighth studio album, Sexy 8 Beat, was released. It was the first album for Aika Mitsui and the last album for Hitomi Yoshizawa and Miki Fujimoto. It featured the singles \"Aruiteru\", \"Egao Yes Nude\", \"Sexy Boy: Soyokaze ni Yorisotte\", and \"Ambitious! Yashinteki de Ii Jan\".\nOn April 25, 2007, Morning Musume released their 33rd single, \"Kanashimi Twilight\". The song style was a huge departure from almost anything Morning Musume had released prior to it, displaying a loud, rock arrangement and the angriest lyrics since Shabondama. This would be the group's last single with members Hitomi Yoshizawa and Miki Fujimoto.\nWith the success of Kanashimi Twilight, on May 1, 2007, Morning Musume became the \"best single selling female group in Japan\" with 11,085,000 copies sold—their fifth Oricon record. The achievement surpasses the previous record set by Pink Lady of 11,037,000 copies sold.\nOn May 6, 2007, Hitomi Yoshizawa left. Miki Fujimoto took her place as leader and Ai Takahashi replaced Fujimoto as sub-leader.\nAs of June 1, 2007, Miki Fujimoto resigned from Morning Musume, due to the tabloid magazine Friday running an article depicting Fujimoto and comedian Tomoharu Shoji in a relationship. Ai Takahashi replaced Fujimoto as leader (a position the latter occupied for the briefest period in the group's history—26 days), and Risa Niigaki became subleader.\nMorning Musume's 34th single, \"Onna ni Sachi Are\", a song with a beatmania style was released on July 25, 2007. It features the debut of new eighth generation members from China, Jun Jun and Lin Lin. The single reached number two on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, with sales of 43,364 copies.\nOn October 26, 2007, Ai Takahashi, Risa Niigaki, and Koharu Kusumi visited Korea to promote their singles collection album Morning Musume All Singles Complete: 10th Anniversary, which was released on October 24, 2007. Also, Takahashi and Niigaki appeared as special guests in a Korean radio show called Maybee's Turn Up the Volume (메이비의 볼륨을 높여요). Later that same month, on October 29, 2007, all nine members traveled to Taiwan for three days to promote the album. This was the first time Morning Musume held a non-Fan Club promotional event as a group outside Japan. During their visit, they attended press conferences, appeared for radio and TV show recordings, and held the first-ever public handshaking event outside Japan.\nOn November 21, 2007, marked the release of Morning Musume's 35th single, \"Mikan\". Initial sales were poor for the song. It became the group's lowest-selling single (even lower than the initial indies release of \"Ai no Tane\", which sold 50,000 copies), both in terms of first week sales and absolute sales figures. As a result, unlike all previous singles, Mikan failed to appear on Oricon's Top 5 Chart, breaking the group's previously held record.\nOn December 31, 2007, Morning Musume performed in the 58th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen with a remixed version of their song \"Love Machine\" along with Cute and Berryz Kobo. Similar to the previous Kōhaku, the red team (females) lost to the white team (males) after attaining votes from the viewers and judges.\n\n\n=== 2008–2010: Platinum Era and stable line-up ===\nAi Takahashi, Eri Kamei, Sayumi Michishige, and Reina Tanaka participated in the musical Ojigi 30 Degrees at the Shinjuku Theater from February 26 to March 2. Morning Musume's 36th music single, \"Resonant Blue\", had been announced for release on March 5, 2008, but was postponed until April 16, 2008, because of the busy schedule in the winter/early spring season.

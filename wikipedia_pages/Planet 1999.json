    "text": "Planet 1999 is a French synth-pop and shoegaze band based in London. The group consists of members Caro, Alex, and Charles, who also operate as solo acts under the names caro♡, DJ Kit (formerly City Links), and Ultralove, respectively. They were the first band to be signed to the record label PC Music. They also occasionally act as songwriters and record producers for other artists.\nAlex described the defining characteristics of their music as a \"minimalistic shoegaze loop with over-processed vocals on top of it.\" The band has cited many shoegaze and krautrock artists as their inspirations. Often featured in Planet 1999's visuals is a mascot named Zippy which was designed by artist Leomi Sadler.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlex and Charles are brothers and previously have made music together. Caro was born in Marseille but grew up further east along the coast and made music mostly on her own. They met after Caro attended a psychedelic rock concert in Paris and found a flyer from Charles and Alex saying they were looking for a singer. Together they formed the now defunct Dead Sea group with Julien Moreno. They were signed to PIAS Recordings, and released a handful of singles, as well as an EP titled Colorate in May 2018.\nIn late 2018, Caro, Alex and Charles emailed A. G. Cook, head of record label PC Music, and after meeting with him were eventually signed to the label.\nCook introduced Charli XCX to Planet 1999's music which led to them co-producing Charli XCX's song \"February 2017\" and Nasty Cherry's \"What Do You Like In Me?\". Planet 1999 also composed the score to the Netflix series about Nasty Cherry's come up.\nPlanet 1999 released their debut single \"Spell\" in September 2019. In November 2019, they performed at fellow PC Music artist Hannah Diamond's concert in Paris during The Invisible Tour. In early 2020, Planet 1999 released two more singles, \"Party\" and \"Replay\", \"Party\" was accompanied by a video featuring their mascot Zippy. Later in the year they released their EP \"Devotion\" in March 2020. The group has named artists Cocteau Twins, Hannah Diamond, Frank Ocean, Croatian Amor, and Uli K as some of the biggest inspirations for the project. In January 2021, they released a deluxe version of the EP, featuring 3 new remixes. This came with a CD release.\nIn August 2020, the band was featured on the song \"Everyday, Everynight\" by Anamanaguchi.\nIn November 2020, Caro began releasing solo material under the moniker caro♡. She released her debut album Heartbeats/Heartbreaks in September 2021. It was released alongside a Bandcamp exclusive bonus demo album titled the lost logic files vol.1.

    "text": "The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Marching Band Association (PIMBA) is a nonprofit organization that provides competitive adjudications for high school marching bands in southwestern Pennsylvania. Founded in 1996 (replacing the now-defunct PFCJ marching band circuit), PIMBA coordinates with local high schools to host band competitions throughout the fall, culminating in the PIMBA Championships. \n\n\n== Background ==\nPIMBA events provide both healthy competition and constructive feedback for performing bands.  Directors pay membership dues in order for their ensemble to be classified as a member of the circuit.  Classifications are broken down by the number of performing students in an ensemble.  The current classifications are as follows:\n\nClass A: 1–54 members\nClass AA: 55– 74 members\nClass AAA: 75–99 members\nClass AAAA: 100+ members\nDirectors may also choose to have their ensemble perform in judged exhibition or Festival Class.  These bands will not be placed but will still receive judges' commentary and an individual score.  From 1997 to 2012, PIMBA also featured a National Class– qualifications for this class included placing in the top five at BOA Regional competitions for two consecutive years or by special request of the director.  The final competition to take place for each season is the PIMBA Championships.  At the championships, bands receive final scoring in their respective classes with the top scoring band from each class being crowned a PIMBA Class Champion.  The championships has historically been held at the following locations:\n\nElizabeth Forward High School– 3 times (2003, 2005, 2007)\nGateway High School– 8 times (2008, 2009, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021, 2024)\nMoon Area High School– 3 times (2016, 2018, and 2023)\nNorth Allegheny Senior High School– 1 time (1996)\nNorwin High School– 5 times (2000, 2002, 2006, 2011, and 2022)\nPenn-Trafford High School– 6 times (1999, 2001, 2004, 2010, 2012, and 2014)\nSouth Park High School– 1 time (1998)\nScoring is based upon the same system used by Bands of America, featuring a Musical Performance category (worth 20 points), a Visual Performance category (worth 20 points), and a General Effect category (worth 60 points).  Unlike BOA, the raw total from these three categories is divided by two and raised by 50 to establish an ensemble's final score. \n\n\n== PIMBA Championship Results: 1996-2024 ==\nThroughout PIMBA's history, there have been 28 Championship competitions.  Several historical caveats should be noted:\n\n1996: AAAA was referred to as Open Class\n1997-2012: National Class was introduced and lasted for 15 seasons\n1999: No Class AAA, AAAA, or National Class Champions (Field Washout)\n2019: No Class AAA or AAAA Champions (Weather Cancellation)\n2020: No PIMBA Festivals or Championships (COVID-19)\nBelow is a historical catalogue of each class champion band, including their respective scores and show titles if known.  Next to the name of the champion in parentheses is the # of times that band has been crowned a class champion.  Additional Note: the current scoring system for PIMBA was introduced in the 2004 season with revisions also being made for the 2013 and 2018 seasons, respectively.\n\nThe five winningest class champion bands include Mars Area High School (15 times; AA/AAA), Gateway High School (15 times; AA/AAA/AAAA), Kiski Area High School (14 times; AAAA/National), Norwin Senior High School (12 times; AAAA/National), and Trinity High School (10 times; AAA/AAAA).  Kiski Area is the most winningest overall champion (regardless of class) with 14 titles.\n\n\n== References =="

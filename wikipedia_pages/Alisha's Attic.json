    "text": "Alisha's Attic were an English pop duo of the 1990s and early 2000s. The two members were sisters Shelly and Karen Poole, born in Barking and Chadwell Heath respectively. Their father is Brian Poole of 1960s group Brian Poole and the Tremeloes.\n\n\n== History ==\nKaren and Shelly released their first single, \"Sugar Daddy\", as Keren & Chelle [sic] in 1988, but it failed to chart in the top 100, reaching No.167. Their chart career began with the release of their debut single \"I Am, I Feel\", which quickly became a radio and chart hit in the UK. This was followed in November 1996 by their entirely self-written debut album Alisha Rules the World. The platinum-selling album was produced by Dave Stewart of Eurythmics, and it spawned four top 15 UK hits and earned them substantial success in Europe and Japan.\nThey were nominated for a 1997 Brit Award for Best Newcomer, and also nominated that year for an Ivor Novello Award for the best lyrical and melodic composition. In July 1997, the band played at the first Lilith Fair festival.\nThey also toured with INXS and supported Jon Bon Jovi, as well as performing on their own headline tours throughout the late 1990s.\nAlisha's Attic went on to release two more albums, Illumina (silver in the UK) which produced the singles \"The Incidentals\", \"Wish I Were You\" and \"Barbarella\", and the critically acclaimed album The House We Built, a mostly live album recorded with Bill Bottrell in Mendocino, USA. The two singles from this album were \"Pretender Got My Heart\" (which was featured in the film Bridget Jones's Diary) and \"Push It All Aside\". Both of these singles featured videos made by Sophie Muller. The group released one more album in Japan – Japanese Dream – before they went their separate ways in 2004.\nBoth members went on to become successful songwriters, writing for artists such as Kylie Minogue, Dannii Minogue, Will Young, and Sugababes. Shelly is also in the band Red Sky July.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Other songs ===\nA cover version of Suede's \"Still Life\" for the 1996 charity album by ChildLine.\nA cover of The Crystals' \"He's a Rebel\" for the 1997 film Bean.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Alisha's Attic website (offline)\nAlisha's Attic discography at MusicBrainz"

    "text": "Haze'evot (Hebrew: הזאבות, translation: The She-Wolves) is an Israeli rock band. The band members are Yifat Balassiano, Talia Ishai, Or Zigelbaum, Hen Yair and Nofar Tom. The band's songs dub the female point of view on different social issues such as relationships, sexual harassment and sex, a voice uncommon which is seldom heard in the mostly male-dominated Israeli music scene.\nHaze'evot is mainly influenced by sounds from the 1990s and plays original material both in Hebrew and English. It has noted Placebo, The Pixies, Radiohead, David Bowie, The Beatles, The Kooks, Sonic Youth, The Killers and Blur as their musical influences.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nIn the 2000s, the four original members of the band met in highschool in the town of Holon, Israel and began to play music together. Their early rehearsals took place at the conservatory in Holon after hours. The custodian, Ze'ev, promised to keep it a secret, under the condition that the band would be named after him.\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\nIn 2012, Haze'evot released its first mini-album under the musical production of Yehu Yaron. In 2015, the band went back to the studio with musical producer Nadav Perser and recorded its second album which was released in May of that year.\nHaze'evot toured Israel non-stop and in October 2016 went on their first European tour and performed at the Waves festival in Vienna. Also in 2016, the management at Bar-Ilan University informed the band that they cannot sing during a Holocaust Memorial Day ceremony.\n\n\n=== 2020s ===\nOn January 30, 2021, Haze'evot officially announced the departure of original member Moran Saranga, also known as Moris, and welcomed Or Zigelbaum who replaced her on guitar.\nIn June 2023 it released their first song from the second album. During July 2023 the band played 11 shows around Germany and the Czech Republic, including the Waldstock festival in Pegnitz, and Colours of Ostrova.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Adamot Yeveshot - 1st EP ===\n\n\n=== Haze'evot - 2nd EP ===\n\n\n=== Haaretz HaShtucha (The Flat Earth) - Studio Album ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nHaze'evot's channel on YouTube\nHaze'evot on SoundCloud \nHaze'evot on Bandcamp"

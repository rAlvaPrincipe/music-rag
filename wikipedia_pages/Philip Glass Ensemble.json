    "text": "The Philip Glass Ensemble is an American musical group founded by composer Philip Glass in 1968 to serve as a performance outlet for his experimental minimalist music. The ensemble continues to perform and record to this day, under the musical direction of keyboardist Michael Riesman.\nThe Ensemble's instrumentation became a hallmark of Glass's early minimalist style. While the ensemble's instrumentation has varied over the years, it has generally consisted of amplified woodwinds (typically saxophones, flutes, and bass clarinet), keyboard synthesizers, and solo soprano voice (singing solfeggio). \nAfter Glass wrote his first opera, Einstein on the Beach, for the ensemble in 1976, he began to compose for other instrumentation more frequently, but he still retains the core ensemble instrumentation. \nIn 2011, individuals from the ensemble performed a series of concerts in an installation at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the Temple of Dendur exhibit. From 2012 until late 2015 the ensemble has presented, along with many other performers, a revival of Einstein on the Beach which opened in Montpellier, France in 2012. \nIn 2013 the ensemble began to perform Glass's opera, La Belle et la Bête again.  The opera is set to the visuals of the 1946 Jean Cocteau film, with the help of four vocalists. In early September 2014 the ensemble performed with Steve Reich and other musicians at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's \"Next Wave Festival.\" It had been over thirty years since Glass and Reich had shared a stage.\nIn February 2018, the ensemble performed with the San Francisco Girls Chorus at Carnegie Hall. They performed the ninety-minute Music With Changing Parts, the work's debut performance with women's chorus and an extremely important concert as this piece is considered to have changed music in the 1970s. Glass has also collaborated with them on their most recent album, Final Answer, and many of his works are featured in performance by SFGC (artistically directed by Ensemble vocalist and keyboardist Lisa Bielawa).\n\n\n== Members ==\nMichael Riesman, keyboards\nPhilip Glass, keyboards\nDan Dryden, audio engineer\nEleanor Sandresky, keyboards\nNelson Padgett, keyboards\nTed Baker, keyboards\nLisa Bielawa, voice\nAndrew Sterman, woodwinds\nMick Rossi, percussion, keyboards\nFrank Cassara, percussion\nPeter Hess, woodwinds\nDan Bora, audio engineer\nRyan Kelly, onstage audio engineer\n\n\n=== Featured vocalists in La Belle et la Bête ===\nGregory Purnhagen, baritone\nPeter Stewart, bass\nMarie Mascari, soprano\nHai-Ting Chin, mezzo-soprano\nAlexandra Montano, mezzo-soprano (deceased)\nJanice Felty, mezzo-soprano (still active in the opera world)\nAnna-Maria Martinez, soprano (still active in the opera world)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nStephen Erb, audio engineer\nMartin Goldray, keyboards\nJon Gibson, woodwinds\nBob Telson, keyboards\nSteve Reich, keyboards\nArt Murphy, keyboards\nSteve Chambers, keyboards\nJames Tenney, keyboards\nRobert Prado, trumpet, flute, and keyboards\nRichard Peck, woodwinds\nJack Kripl, woodwinds\nRichard Landry, woodwinds\nDavid Crowell, woodwinds\nJoan La Barbara, voice and keyboards\nIris Hiskey, voice and keyboards\nDora Ohrenstein, voice and keyboards\nBarbara Benary, violin and voice\nDavid Behrman, viola\nBeverly Lauridsen, cello\nSeymour Barab, cello\nKurt Munkacsi, audio engineer (now a studio producer)\n\n\n== Films ==\n1982 –  Koyaanisqatsi.

    "text": "Grauzone (German for \"grey area\", [ˈɡraʊ̯.tsoːnə]) was a band from Bern, Switzerland, that was active and disbanded in the early 1980s. The band is most famous for their 1981 hit \"Eisbär\" (\"Polar Bear\"). The single charted at number 12 in Germany and number 6 in Austria. In addition to \"Eisbär\", they had some success with the singles \"Film 2\" and \"Wütendes Glas\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nAt the end of 1979, Marco Repetto (drums) and GT (bass) left the punk band Glueams to form a new band called Grauzone with Martin Eicher (guitar, vocals, synthesizer). Martin had already supported Glueams on their single '\"Mental\". \nGrauzone's  first concert was in March 1980 at club Spex in Bern. Martin's brother Stephan Eicher (guitar, synthesizer), Max Kleiner and Claudine Chirac (saxophone) supplemented the group temporarily in live appearances and recordings.\nThe band found some commercial success to their resentment, their first single Eisbär charting well in Germany and Austria.\nAfter ten concerts, four singles and an album the group split up at the end of 1982.\n\n\n=== After Grauzone ===\nGT and Marco Repetto formed a new band Missing Link, later Eigernordwand, with the former Glueams guitarist Martin Pavlinec and the drummer Dominique Uldry. GT supplemented the futurism oriented  performance group \"Red Catholic Orthodox Jewish Chorus\" around performance artist Edy Marconi, in which occasionally Marco Repetto also played. Later the group changed their name to I Suonatori.\nStephan Eicher started a successful solo career.\nIn 1988, Martin Eicher published his solo-EP Spellbound Lovers. In 1989, Marco Repetto started a new career as a Techno and Ambient DJ, musician and producer (a.o. mittageisen v2).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n1981 – Grauzone (D No. 37)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n1998 – Die Sunrise Tapes\n2010 – Grauzone 1980–1982 (double album – remastered)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1981 – \"Eisbär/Ich lieb sie\" (D No. 12, A No. 6)\n1981 – \"Moskau/Ein Tanz mit dem Tod/Ich lieb sie\"\n1982 – \"Träume mit mir/Wütendes Glas\"\n1983 – \"Moskau/Film 2\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial band-website at the indie-label mital-U\nGrauzone at AllMusic"

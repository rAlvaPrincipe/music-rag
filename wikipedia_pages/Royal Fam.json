Timbo King is the leader and founding member of the group and Y-Kim The Ill Figure was initially their main producer. Other group members are Mighty Jarrett, Dark Denim, Dreddy Kruger and Sharecka (Stoneface).\nRoyal Fam is one of the first crew connected directly with Wu-Tang Clan, much like Killarmy and Sunz of Man. They are part of Wu-Tang Killa Beez and United Kingdom (Population Clik), a collective consisting of Royal Fam, Sunz of Man, Brooklyn Zu, C.O.I.N.S., Black Rose Kartel, The Beggaz Clan, Makeba Mooncycle and Popa Wu.\nTheir official debut studio album, \"Black Castle\", was recorded in 1995 and 1996 for Capitol Records and produced by Y-Kim The Ill Figure; it was scheduled to be released twice and shelved as many times. They also shot a video for Black Castle's debut single \"Something Gots To Give\". In 2020, Back2DaSource Records finally released the album, in its original format, completely how it was meant to be issued including unreleased and unknown material.\nIn 1997, Royal Fam featured with Prodigal Sunn on \"La Saga\" of IAM's album L'Ã‰cole du micro d'argent, winning a France Music Award for the song. Then they appeared with Killa Sin, Shyheim and Tekitha on Soul in the Hole (soundtrack).

However, in 2021, the original version of the album was officially released thru De Rap Winkel Records.

    "text": "Sinnamon was an American female R&B vocal trio, consisting of Connecticut natives Barbara Fowler, Marsha Carter, and Melissa Bell from New York City. The group went through an abrupt development from a minimalist contemporary R&B sound of post-disco which was dropped after a third release, moving towards mild freestyle and radio-friendly house music but still preserving their R&B affiliation. Bell is currently a writer, living in New York City.\n\n\n== History ==\nTheir greatest success occurred in 1982 when their song \"Thanks to You\" spent two weeks at number one on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in Billboard. The song also reached number 44 on the US Billboard R&B chart. Their song \"I Need You Now\" features uncredited guest vocals by Bernard Fowler from the Peech Boys.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one dance hits (United States)\nList of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chart\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSinnamon discography at Discogs"

    "text": "The 15th Field Regiment (RCA) Band is one of five Reserve Force bands in the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, located at Bessborough Armoury in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is a brass and reed band that is part of the RCA's 15th Field Artillery Regiment. All 45 members of the band are reservists while being trained as soldiers and musicians. The Band plays for a variety of events including military funerals, ceremonies, parades and Mess events. The band maintains a full marching and concert band as well as other musical ensembles that include jazz combos and rock bands.\nThe band's Director of Music is the unit's principal conductor and is responsible for the band's creative direction. The band was formed in 1934, 20 years after the regiment's establishment and just after it moved into its current base. Since 1994, the band has been the only reserve band on the mainland British Columbia. In 2000, the band outgrew its facilities in the Bessborough Armoury and relocated to the Garrison Headquarters building near Jericho Beach on English Bay. The Band then moved to the newly built Hoffmeister Building near the Burrard Street Bridge in 2019. Although still under the command and control of the home regiment, the band functions largely independently as a self-contained subunit and performs more than one hundred engagements annually.\n\n\n== Directors of Music ==\nThe following is a list of directors of music since 1933:\n\nWill Edmunds (1934-1937)\nChief Warrant Officer Al Sweet (1953-1969)\nMajor Peter Erwin (1969-1984)\nCaptain Richard Van Slyke (1984-2004)\nCaptain James Tempest (2004-2017)\nCaptain Cheryl McHugh (2017-2022)\nWarrant Officer Nathaniel Senff (2022-2023)\nLieutenant Eric Wong (2023-Present)\n\n\n== Role ==\n\n  \nThe band is a part of 39 Canadian Brigade Group, and supports all types of activities in the brigade.

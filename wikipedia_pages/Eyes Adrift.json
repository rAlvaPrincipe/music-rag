    "text": "Eyes Adrift (known in Australia as Bud, Curt & Krist) was a three-piece rock supergroup consisting of Krist Novoselic (bass guitar, formerly of Nirvana), Curt Kirkwood (guitar and lead vocals, of Meat Puppets),  and Bud Gaugh (drums, formerly of Sublime and Long Beach Dub Allstars). They released a self-titled album in 2002, which was a mixture of punk, grunge, and country, taking all of their previous backgrounds and putting them together. They toured the United States in mid-2002. They later broke up in 2003, after their debut album flopped. Kirkwood and Gaugh went on to form the supergroup band known as Volcano. The album is currently out of print. Novoselic went on to become a political activist in Seattle, Washington, before forming Giants in the Trees.\nIn Australia, there was another group called \"Eyes Adrift\", and rather than pay to license that name, the trio called the band and album \"Bud, Curt & Krist\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Self-titled album ===\n\nEyes Adrift (Bud, Curt & Krist in Australia), the band's only album, was released on September 24, 2002. \"Alaska\" was the album's only single, released on March 3, 2003 in the UK.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Sleight of Hand\" – 4:11\n\"Alaska\" – 2:51\n\"Inquiring Minds\" – 2:46\n\"Untried\" – 3:56\n\"Blind Me\" – 4:01\n\"Dottie Dawn & Julie Jewel\" – 3:04\n\"Solid\" – 3:37\n\"Pyramids\" – 5:13\n\"Telescope\" – 4:06\n\"Slow Race\" – 5:00\n\"What I Said\" – 4:34\n\"Pasted\" – 15:33\n\"Inquiring Minds\" is dedicated to JonBenét Ramsey.\nThe Japanese edition of the album, released on January 29, 2003 includes two additional tracks; \"Son of Pasted\" (also known as \"The Jerk\") and \"The Cup & The Lip\".\n\n\n=== \"Alaska\" single ===\nThe CD single to \"Alaska\", released on December 2, 2003 includes the tracks: \"The Jerk\" and \"The Cup & the Lip\".\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nKrist Novoselic – bass guitar, lead vocals on \"Inquiring Minds\", \"Dottie Dawn & Julie Jewel\" and \"Pasted\"\nCurt Kirkwood – guitar, lead vocals on \"Sleight Of Hand\", \"Alaska\", \"Untried\", \"Blind Me\", \"Solid\", \"Pyramids\", \"Telescope\", \"Slow Race\" and \"What I Said\"\nBud Gaugh – drums, percussion, synthesizer\nJimmy Shortell – trumpet on \"Sleight of Hand\"\nJohn Plymale - Mix Engineer\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMeat Puppets collection at the Internet Archive's live music archive\nMeat Puppets Live Repository"

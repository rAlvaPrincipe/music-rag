The album showcases Arashi's ambitious challenging spirit and continuous evolution. The lead track \"Kokoro no Sora\" was composed by Tomoyasu Hotei, who is based in London, with the theme \"Japan seen from the outside\" in mind. Described as a \"passionate and manly song\", Arashi sings to a fast-paced Hotei sound, where a battle between Arashi, Hotei, and Japanese instruments take place. The album includes a cover of Shonentai's \"Nihon Yoitoko Maka Fushigi\".\nJaponism includes two of the group's previously released singles: \"Sakura\" and \"Aozora no Shita, Kimi no Tonari\". This album also includes fourteen new songs plus five of each member's solo songs. It also includes their previously unreleased song \"Furusato\" which they have sung regularly since 2010.\n\"Sakura\" was used as the theme song for the drama Ouroborous, starring actors Toma Ikuta and Shun Oguri. This is the first time Arashi has provided a theme song for a drama that did not star one of its members. \"Aozora no Shita, Kimi no Tonari\" was used as the theme song for the drama Yokoso, Wagaya E, which stars Arashi member Masaki Aiba.\n\n\n== Promotion ==\nTo support their new album, Arashi performed a live tour, ARASHI LIVE TOUR 2015 Japonism, performing at all the major dome stadiums in Japan.

    "text": "Styles of Beyond was an American underground hip hop group from the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, California. The group consists of MCs Ryan Patrick Maginn (Ryu) and Takbir Bashir (Tak), Colton Raisin Fisher (DJ Cheapshot), and producer Jason Rabinowitz (Vin Skully). They have released two LPs, one mixtape and were heavily featured on Mike Shinoda's Fort Minor project in 2005. At one point they were also signed to Shinoda's Machine Shop Recordings label, although they left the label in late 2008. They are also heavily associated with the underground rap group Demigodz which features similar underground artists such as Apathy, Celph Titled, and 7L & Esoteric.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1994–2004) ===\n\nAfter making some pre-Ryu demos on a 4-track cassette recorder, Styles of Beyond started making appearances on Sway & King Tech's The Wake Up Show, a hip hop radio program featuring established and up-and-coming rappers. In the late 1990s, the group met longtime collaborator and friend Mike Shinoda, who would later become the co-creator and co-vocalist of Linkin Park. The group eventually released two independent studio albums, 2000 Fold (1998), and Megadef (2003).\n\n\n=== Machine Shop/Warner Bros. era (2005–2008) ===\nStyles of Beyond was later announced by Shinoda to feature on his solo hip hop record under the name Fort Minor, The Rising Tied, which was released on November 22, 2005. The group appeared on seven songs on the album, and appeared on the album's singles \"Remember the Name\" and \"Believe Me\". The group joined Fort Minor on tour in promotion of the album. After touring for The Rising Tied, Styles of Beyond was signed onto Shinoda's label Machine Shop Recordings, as well as its parent label Warner Bros. Records, their first major label. The group was later added to the lineup of Linkin Park's 2007 Projekt Revolution tour, featured on the Revolution Stage.\nStyles of Beyond released a mixtape on July 31, 2007, entitled Razor Tag, presented and mixed by DJ Green Lantern. Razor Tag was the group's first release under Machine Shop and Warner Bros. The group completed their third studio album, Reseda Beach, with announced guest rappers RZA, Apathy, Celph Titled, Sixx John, and Mike Shinoda. The album was produced by the group, as well as Shinoda, J Dilla and Scoop DeVille. One of the album's songs, \"Second to None\", which features Shinoda, was included in the soundtrack of the 2007 film Transformers. \"Second to None\" was also featured in promos for the television shows Prison Break and K-Ville, as well as the trailer for the 2008 film You Don't Mess with the Zohan. The group also made a cameo appearance in the music video for \"We Made It\" by Busta Rhymes and Linkin Park, which was released on April 29, 2008.\n\n\n=== Departure from Machine Shop, hiatus and solo projects (2008–2011) ===\nOn September 25, 2008, Styles of Beyond released their contract with Machine Shop Recordings with full ownership of their Reseda Beach record, which they plan to release under Dirty Version Records, which was manned by close friends and Demigodz members Apathy and Celph Titled. Reseda Beach served as the first release of Dirty Version. Since 2008, Ryu, Apathy and Scoop DeVille formed a new rap group by the name of the \"Get Busy Committee\". they released their first album \"Uzi Does It\" on October 27, 2009. Tak has also formed a solo group along with singer Josy B called \"Ribkat\" (which is \"Takbir\" spelled backwards, Takbir Bashir being Tak's real name). They plan on releasing an album entitled Theory of Addicts in December 2009.\nRyu stated recently in an interview with LPLive that the current status of Styles of Beyond is unknown. in the interview he stated \"The Warner thing I think mentally exhausted everybody, I think it was just time to do something fresh and new. Business wise and creatively. The status of the group is unknown at this point. It just felt like we were beating a dead horse after a while.\"\n\n\n=== Reseda Beach and inactivity (2012–present) ===\nRecently, during a fan chat, Ryu revealed that a completed version of Reseda Beach exists. The first track from Reseda Beach leaked in early September 2012, named \"Damn\" and featuring guest vocals from fellow Warner Bros. recording artist Michael Bublé. Reseda Beach was eventually available for pre-order on the Demigodz store in the same month, including the track \"The Pirate Song\" on SoundCloud. The album was released on October 23, 2012.\nIn November 2014, Ryu tweeted that Styles of Beyond is still active and, along with Divine Styler, will be undertaking a Canadian tour.\nIn 2015, Fort Minor released a new single entitled \"Welcome\" in which Ryu has a cameo appearance in the music video.\nIn November 2017, Ryu tweeted a screenshot of a conversation with Tak with the duo planning another album.

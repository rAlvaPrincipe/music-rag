    "text": "V-U-den (美勇伝, Biyūden, stylized in lowercase, lit. \"beautiful brave legends\") was a Japanese idol girl group associated with Hello! Project. The group was formed in August 2004 and consists of members Rika Ishikawa (Morning Musume), Erika Miyoshi, and Yui Okada, with Ishikawa being the leader. The group officially disbanded on June 29, 2008, after their last concert during their v-u-densetsu 5 tour.\n\n\n== Members ==\nRika Ishikawa\nErika Miyoshi\nYui Okada\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nIn 2009, V-U-den was revived as a Hello! Project Shuffle Unit under the name Zoku V-U-den (続・美勇伝). The new line-up consisted of Morning Musume members Sayumi Michishige and Jun Jun; and Berryz Kobo member Risako Sugaya. The group released songs for Hello! Project's compilation album Champloo 1: Happy Marriage Song Cover Shū. They also performed as a concert-only unit until 2011. In 2013, Zoku V-U-den reappeared with Rika Ishikawa to perform \"Koisuru Angel Heart\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums (first generation) ===\n\n\n=== Singles (first generation) ===\n\n* Though the romanization of this song would imply the translation would be \"Ice Cream and My Pudding\", \"Aisu\" is written with the kanji \"Ai (愛)\" for \"love\", thus making it \"Love Cream and My Pudding\".  Also, in the PV for the song, there is a two-second screen that translates it as \"Ice Cream and My Pudding\", therefore it is a play on words.\n\n\n=== Singles (second generation) ===\n\n\"ONLY YOU\" is released on the compilation \"Champloo 1 ~Happy Marriage Song Cover Shuu~ (チャンプル1 ~ハッピーマリッジソングカバー集~)\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Hello!

    "text": "Allstars (stylised allSTARS*) were a British pop group, who were active between 2001 and 2002, achieving some chart success in the UK. Consisting of Sam Bloom, Thaila Zucchi, Ashley Taylor Dawson, Rebecca Hunter and Sandi Lee Hughes (the initial letters of the band members' names making up the \"stars\" of in the name of their group), they were probably best noted for having their own television show, STARStreet*, on CITV between 2001 and 2002.\n\n\n== Formation and split ==\nThe group managed to score four Top 20 singles in a year. The first was \"Best Friends\", which peaked at No. 20 in June 2001. The second was a double A-side of their own track, Things That Go Bump in the Night, and a cover of Duran Duran's \"Is There Something I Should Know?\", the former track later appearing on the soundtrack to the first Scooby-Doo movie. It reached No. 12 in September 2001.\nTheir third single, released in January 2002, was another cover, this time of Bucks Fizz's \"The Land of Make Believe\", and it gave them their first and only top 10 hit, reaching No. 9. Their fourth single, released in late April 2002, was another double A-side, but this time both were original tracks, \"Back When\" and \"Going All the Way\", the latter appearing on the soundtrack to the movie Thunderpants. This however reached No. 19, and when their self-titled debut album only managed to peak at No. 43 â€“ spending only 2 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, the band parted ways with their record company, Island, and split up soon after, in June 2002. The album was re-released with a bonus remix CD.\nThe band appeared in their own television programme STARStreet* which aired on ITV1's CITV block where they played fictionalised versions of themselves living inside a supernatural house. The show's theme tune was \"Best Friends\" and in each episode the band would perform one of their songs. The first season aired in early 2001 and was often repeated on CITV throughout the year and the second season aired in Spring 2002. The series ended when the band split up. STARStreet* has also aired in Canada on Vrak.tv as S.T.A.R.S in french.\nBefore the band split up, there was a soundtrack album from STARStreet*, which was going to be released however, due to the band splitting up, the album titled STARStreet: The Music was cancelled.\n\n\n== After the band ==\nThaila Zucchi did some presenting work in the Meridian region of ITV, which included announcing the regional results for Record of the Year in 2003.

    "text": "Balmorhea (pronounced bal-mə-ray) is a six-piece minimalist instrumental ensemble from Austin, Texas, that was formed in 2006 by Rob Lowe and Michael Muller. Balmorhea were influenced by William Ackerman, The Six Parts Seven, Tortoise, Rachel's, Gillian Welch, Max Richter, Arvo Pärt and John Cage.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe band self-released their first album, Balmorhea, in April 2007, and their second album, Rivers Arms, in February 2008, and released a limited EP in the fall of 2008. The group released their third full-length album, All is Wild, All is Silent, on Western Vinyl Records. Their fourth full-length album, Constellations, was released in February 2010 on Western Vinyl, and their fifth, Stranger, was released late October 2012. The band released the \"Heir\" 7\" in 2014 as a companion to the re-release of their 2007 eponymous debut. \nThe song \"Bowsprit,\" from the album Constellations, was used as the opening theme for the SundanceTV television series Rectify, and the song \"Remembrance\" from the album All Is Wild, All Is Silent was used within the 2015 Turkish film Delibal.\nBalmorhea, called \"an exemplary experiment in restraint\" by The New Yorker, has toured the US and Europe eight times each, including shows with Tortoise, Thurston Moore, Fleet Foxes, Mono, CocoRosie, Sharon Van Etten, Damien Jurado, Efterklang, This Will Destroy You, and others.

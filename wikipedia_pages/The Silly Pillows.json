    "text": "The Silly Pillows were an American indie pop band formed by Jonathan Caws-Elwitt. They began as a home-recorded duo of Jonathan and his wife Hilary Caws-Elwitt, sharing tapes through the cassette underground. In the 1990s the band evolved into a studio-recorded full lineup, which dissolved in 2000. From 2005 to 2008, Jonathan and Hilary revived their home-recording career as \"The Original Silly Pillows.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 1980s, Jonathan had been part of punk/psych/experimental group The Killer Asparagus (in the Boston area) and punk pop band The Degrads (in Rochester, NY, along with his brother Sam Elwitt). Jonathan started recording cassettes at home in 1984, and in 1986 he asked his wife Hilary Caws-Elwitt to join him on vocals, with the duo recording as the Silly Pillows.\nThe first Silly Pillows recordings were circulated on cassette through the growing network of home tapers, spurred by positive reviews in the magazines Option and Sound Choice (who said that \"their whole catalog is essential listening\"). In 1992, Hilary decided to stop singing, but by then their cassettes had attracted some attention in Europe. The tracks on the Silly Pillows' first vinyl release, \"When She Gets Home,\" were home-recorded. In 1993, Jonathan assembled a group of friends for the Silly Pillows' first studio recordings, which were released as the \"Equilibrium\" EP on Norway's Perfect Pop label. The first studio lineup included Jonathan, Sam, Cheryl De Luke, and Christopher Earl of Squires of the Subterrain. Over the next few years, more studio recordings were released on vinyl and CD by Perfect Pop and the German label Little Teddy, bringing the band notice such places as Chickfactor (\"It just bubbles over with vintage ambience and playfulness.... and it's more than just slightly pretty\") and The Village Voice (making Elisabeth Vincentelli's \"Pazz & Jop\" top-10 list in 1996).\nIn 1996, the possibility of a Japanese tour led Jonathan to assemble a lineup that could perform live: Jonathan (vocals), Sam (guitar), Michael E. Fiato (bass), Dave Joachim (drums; later a best-selling cookbook author), singer-songwriter/artist Linda Smith (vocals), and Charlie Zayleskie (keyboards). Although the tour never happened, the Silly Pillows performed in New York and a few other locations, opening for some well-known acts like The Magnetic Fields. Belinda Miller of the kids' radio show Greasy Kid Stuff later became the female co-vocalist; Time Out New York likened the Caws-Elwitt–Miller stage presence to \"Mexican jumping beans.\"\nIn Japan, where a split single (with Citrus) on Rover Records had reached No. 3 on the domestic singles chart, enthusiasm was high enough that a subsidiary of major Japanese label Teichiku Records released a \"best-of\" compilation, Pillow Paw Prints, in 1997. New Affections, released in 1998, was the Pillows' last full-length label recording. In 2000, the band set up a temporary studio at the Caws-Elwitt home in Friendsville, Pennsylvania, to record a new project, but soon after the lineup dissolved. The five song EP that had been recorded was released online as Tomorrow Is Yesterday.\nAfter a hiatus, Jonathan began recording at home again. He and Hilary began making new recordings as the \"Original Silly Pillows.\" In 2007, Jonathan, Charlie, and Hilary made two pop-festival appearances as \"Silly Piano Pillows.\"\nIn 2010, an instrumental rendition of a 1990 Silly Pillows track was released by Nada Surf as part of their covers album If I Had a Hi-Fi.\n\n\n== Style ==\nStylistically, the band's music has been described as \"gems replete with incisive hooks, mindblowing harmonies and solos, and varied multilayered instrumentation with creative stylistic unpredictability and arresting rhythms.\" Jonathan has stated that his goal is to achieve \"exuberance, sincerity, and beauty without sadness.\"\n\n\n== Other projects ==\nJonathan and Hilary have collaborated with home-tapers Dreamgirl Stephanie Ashlyn and Ken Clinger.\nHilary's brother, Matthew Caws, is the singer/guitarist in Nada Surf. Sam played bass for Matthew's first band, The Cost of Living. Jonathan co-wrote a song with Matthew for Because Because Because, a short-lived band between The Cost of Living and Nada Surf, and Matthew later sang backing vocals on the Silly Pillows track \"Katy Tongue in Cheek.\"\nJonathan co-wrote songs for The Neos, a Binghamton, NY studio project featuring Charlie.\nJonathan wrote a song for the Norwegian band The Tables.\nJonathan co-produced \"My Picasso Girlfriend\" for The Dupont Circles.\nCharlie's song \"Space Pilot Astrud Star\" (from the Starflower compilation) was co-written by Jonathan and featured performances by Dave and Sam.\nSam is The Nutley Brass and was a member of Sea Monkeys. He wrote and performed music for the Queer Duck cartoons, and has produced two Miriam Linna albums. A 1990s solo project, The Hazeltones, featured some songs co-written with Jonathan.\nCharlie was part of Stew's Passing Strange show during its developmental phase.\nMichael went on to play with Destroy the Planet.\nDeco Pillow was a techno/dance side project of the Original Silly Pillows.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n(The Silly Pillows self-released many cassette-only albums from 1988 to 1993.)\n\nLook!

In 2013 they released their second album Almost Famous including their hit single, \"Jersey Strong\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThey formed in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States, in 2006, although various members have played together in other bands for over 10 years. The band currently divides it's time between New Jersey and Nashville, Tennessee, but perform shows all over the country. They play a large repertoire of their own material written mainly by head songwriter Strevens, but also include collaborations with Kelly. 2010 saw the independent release of their debut album \"Hillbilly Clubhouse\" to criticâ€™s raves with the title track receiving airplay both nationally and internationally.

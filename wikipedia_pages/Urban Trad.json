    "text": "Urban Trad is a Belgian folk music group, consisting of both Flemish and French speaking people and a close connection with Galicia.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nYves Barbieux: flutes and Galician bagpipe\nVeronica Codesal: vocals\nSoetkin Collier: vocals\nSophie Cavez (replaced Didier Laloy): diatonic accordion\nPhilip Masure: acoustic guitar\nMichel Morvan: drums (died 3 July 2010)\nDirk Naessens: violin\nMarie-Sophie Talbot: vocals, piano and percussions (no longer with the band)\nBo Waterschoot: bass\nJill Delien: bass (since 2014)\nNicolas Scalliet: drums (since 2014)\n\n\n== Eurovision Song Contest ==\nUrban Trad participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, where they ended second with the song \"Sanomi\", a modern folk song with vocals in an imaginary language. A few months before the contest, the selectors dropped singer Soetkin Collier on the advice of the Belgian security services, who claimed that she'd had extreme right sympathies in the past. Collier vigorously denied the claims, and later that year after an investigation it was concluded that the accusations were exaggerated and based on outdated information.\nAs a result of this, two versions of the song exist on record.  One was the standard album version (4:08) and another version was released on single and on the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 collaboration album. Often known as the Eurovision edit, it cut down to 3:01 and it had Soetkin Collier's vocals removed.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nOne o Four (2001)\n1. Subway Call\n2. Avreel\n3. La Belle Jig\n4.

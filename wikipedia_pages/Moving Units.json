    "text": "Moving Units is an American dance-punk band from Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 2001 by Blake Miller (formerly of Spectacle) Johan Boegli and Chris Hathwell after Miller invited Boegli and Hathwell to jam songs from an early demo he self-produced. They released their debut EP, Moving Units, on Three One G in early 2002. Their touring experience includes opening slots for Hot Hot Heat, Pixies, Blur and Nine Inch Nails.  Their debut full-length album, Dangerous Dreams, was released on October 12, 2004, by Palm Pictures.\nMoving Units released their second studio album, Hexes for Exes in 2007 on Metropolis Records. The first single, \"Pink Thoughts\", was released through the band's MySpace page. So Sweet released a one-off limited edition 7 inch vinyl single \"Crash N Burn Victims\" in the UK coupled with a remix of the same track by Felix Cartal in November 2007.\nThe band released an EP titled Tension War on February 14, 2011. Moving Units chose to self-release the new EP in conjunction with their management firm, Post Modern. Moving Units also played at Coachella 2011 in support of their latest release.\nOn March 31, 2012, Moving Units announced via their Facebook page that Blake Miller had left the band by mutual decision.\nIn late 2012, Blake Miller had performed shows with the band name \"Moving Units\" without approval of the original members, causing a mild dispute. The issue being resolved later, the original band members reached an agreement where Miller was given permission to use the band's name \"Moving Units\" with new members and continue the project under the same moniker.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nDangerous Dreams (2004, Palm Pictures)\nHexes for Exes (2007, Metropolis)\nNeurotic Exotic (2013, Metropolis)\nDamage with Care (2016, Metropolis / Kitty Play)\nA Tribute to Joy Division: Collision With Joy Division (2017, Flowers of Romance)\nThis is Six (2018, Metropolis)\nEPs\n\nMoving Units (2002, Palm Pictures)\nTension War (2011, Moving Units Recordings / Post Modern Records / Cobra Music)\nSingles\n\n\"Available\" (2003, Palm Pictures)\n\"Crash 'n' Burn Victims\" (7-inch vinyl) (2007, So Sweet)\n\n\n== Related links ==\nThe Smell\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site"

    "text": "Final is a project of English musician Justin Broadrick, creator of the band Godflesh, which he started when he was 13 years old.  Unlike Godflesh, Final is primarily electronic in nature, taking on a space-like, dark ambient sound.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally project was formed in 1982 as a power electronics/industrial duo of Justin Broadrick and Andy Swan (who Broadrick met at the city's Rag Market and both shared an interest in power electronics and industrial bands such as Throbbing Gristle, Ramleh and Whitehouse) under name Atrocity Exhibition. The duo released cassettes on Post Mortem Rekordings, Justin Broadrick's own cassette label (started in 1982 and ended in 1986). Later in 1983, the duo changed their name to Smear Campaign, and first performed live on 7 July 1984 in The Mermaid Pub in Birmingham, using Broadrick’s stepfather's shortwave radio and distortion pedals. The played at the pub alongside Con-Dom and Family Patrol Group and was briefly signed on The Grey Wolves's label, changing their name to Final after this show.\nBeginning in 1982, Broadrick released over fifty tapes through his Post Mortem Rekordings label until 1986, many of which were Final tapes. Other contributors during this period included Guy Pearce, Nicholas Bullen (of Scum fame), Kevin Johnson, and Paul Neville. The music from this period is expected to receive a boxset reissue on Hospital Productions. In 1986, Final went on hiatus while Justin Broadrick played in Napalm Death and Head of David and later co-founded Godflesh. Andy Swan would later go on to form the bands Iroha and Khost, both of which Broadrick has remixed songs for.\nFinal was revived in 1993 as an experimental ambient solo project of Justin Broadrick meant to \"explore beat-less spaces\" and focus on textures, now expanding its influences to the likes of Brian Eno and Maurizio Bianchi. This new incarnation started utilizing electric guitar, tape decks, synthesizers and samplers. One was released on Sentrax and Subharmonic and was Final's first ever CD release. 2 (1996) and 3 (2006), which both compiled pieces recorded over several years, were collaborations with Broadrick's bass players: Godflesh's G. C. Green and Jesu's Diarmuid Dalton respectively. Two series of live improvised music were self released under the Final name on Avalanche Recordings, Infinite Guitar (2007-2009) and Guitar & Bass Improvisations (2007-2013). A collaborative avant-garde drone album with Dirk Serries was also released in 2009, Final + Fear Falls Burning.\nFinal played its first live show in twenty years as support for The Living Jarboe in 2005, with a laptop as the only instrument. A European tour followed in 2006 alongside L'Enfance Rouge and a further show was played later that year at Supersonic Festival and as support for Isis at All Tomorrow's Parties. One-off shows were played in Birmingham in 2009, during Broadrick's Roadburn Festival residence in 2012 and as a double bill with the live debut of Council Estate Electronics in 2014. The Birmingham show saw a Bandcamp release as Live Reprocessed (2016). Dalton assisted Broadrick on some of these dates. Final played its first ever United States show on 8 December 2018 at Hospital Fest in Queens, New York City.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent lineup\n\nJustin Broadrick (1982–1986, 1993–present)\nFormer members\n\nAndy Swan (1982–1986)\nFormer touring musicians and collaborators\n\nPhilip Timms\nDaniel Johnson\nPaul Neville\nNicholas Bullen (1983, 1984)\nGraham Robertson\nKevin Johnson\nGuy Pearce\nG.C.

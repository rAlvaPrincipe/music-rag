    "text": "The Alabama Symphony Orchestra is a major orchestra based in Birmingham, Alabama. The orchestra's resident and principal conductor is Christopher Confessore. The Orchestra was first formed in April 1921 but had to close because of financial issues in 1993. It re-opened in 1997 after substantial fundraising.\n\n\n== Programs ==\n\nSince its rebirth in 1997, The Alabama Symphony Orchestra has undertaken an ambitious effort to reach every corner of the city and the state with a varied and impressive program of music. The ASO now includes 6 subscription series and 11 special event concerts in its seasons annually. The ASO also offers a very successful series for school children–Young People's Concerts (YPC). Each season, thousands of students attend a total of six YPCs. Teachers receive study guides in advance to help prepare students for these concerts and to enhance the educational experience.\nOn June 29, 2011, the ASO received the John S. Edwards Award for its strong commitment to new American music, demonstrating an enthusiasm for performing the works of living composers. In addition to the concert season in Birmingham, concerts have included Tuscaloosa, Anniston, Decatur, Point Clear, Montgomery (Huntingdon College), Florence, Selma, Dothan and Enterprise. The ASO's association with the Alabama Ballet and Opera Birmingham flourishes as the orchestra accompanies many of their performances. The ASO also planned to collaborate with the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, Alys Stephens Center, Summerfest Performing Ensemble, and the Birmingham Concert Chorale in concert performances.\n\n\n== Music Directors ==\nCarlos Izcaray (2015–)\nJustin Brown (2006–2012)\nRichard Westerfield (1997–2004) In May 2004, he stepped down from a 6-year tenure as music director of the Alabama Symphony.\nPaul Polivnick (1985–1993)\nAmerigo Marino (1964–1984)\nArthur Winograd (1960–1964)\nArthur Bennett Lipkin (1949–1960)\nDorsey Whittington (1933–1942)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHuntsville Symphony Orchestra\nMobile Symphony Orchestra\nTuscaloosa Symphony Orchestra\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlabama Symphony Orchestra website\nAlabama Symphony Orchestra Chorus website"

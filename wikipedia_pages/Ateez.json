From Middle Eastern flavors, traces of indie pop, tropical house, synthwave, and trap-infused slow jams they have created a strong singular identity without sacrificing creativity and variety. Their B-side tracks explore and present several sides of the group. The group makes sure to be deeply involved in the songwriting, production, and conceptualization of each album. Most of their lyrics are motivational and revolve around teamwork, success, togetherness, and confidence. Their lead singles tend to be anthemic and incite a sense of euphoria in their audiences.\nAccording to Forbes, Ateez’s multifaceted artistry is reflected in their style and youth-focused messaging. Their lyrics delve into the growth and decision-making process that humans experience during adolescence. Earmilk describes the group's discography as a powerful combination of hip-hop and electronic trap. And that it is dark-tinged and of bold musicality. USA Today describes the group's music as having a \"varied nature\", which highlights their versatility and adaptability.\n\nATEEZ has always taken on new challenges in terms of sounds and genres throughout the various albums we’ve released until now. Honestly, I think we’ve enjoyed challenging ourselves to try new things because there’s no need to confine ourselves to a specific genre if the music can highlight and bring together the strengths of the individual members. While we’ve had songs where we focused on a more cinematic and dramatic style to follow a storyline, we also understand the joy of the entertainment that can be found in the music itself. This track brings this to the forefront, even bolder in sound and creative in the blending of each member’s unique abilities. I’m excited for us to be able to continue to showcase ATEEZ’s distinct identity within a framework we create for ourselves through various musical challenges and performances.\n\n\n=== Stage performances and concepts ===\nRolling Stone India observed that Ateez created intrigue with their polished dance moves and compelling facial expressions. Unlike most groups that rely on a specific 'concept' formula for their debut, Ateez focuses on their execution on stage. They exude confidence, have phenomenal stage presence, has developed a hard-hitting signature sound, and fit together seamlessly as a team. Their work meets the K-pop industry’s standards of cinematic production and penchant for hidden narratives, but the symbolism lies in their movements.They move like clockwork, intricate details woven in seamlessly in every piece of choreography and their facial expressions are striking.\nConsequence described that the group tends to explore various genres but excels in explosive, theatrical performances. Their group concept incorporates pirate imagery. The \"Ateez\" style of music and dancing stands out from that of many of their peers in the industry. While precise choreography has typically been the industry standard, the members of the group aren’t afraid to let their individual strengths shine onstage.\nBillboard noted that the group was known for honing its intense choreography and showmanship during performances. According to USA Today, Ateez are known for their powerful performances and concepts. They bring high energy with a flair of cool. \nThe Clash Music report on Ateez' Towards the Light: Will to Power world tour in Washington D.C talks about the storyline that is woven into each project and performance which adds to the worldbuilding experience for the audience. The report notes that performing is their way of \"rebelling\" against the real-life industry that had little faith in them, and the fictitious oppressive government in their storyline. Anarchy and mutiny appeared to be the dominant themes in their narrative. 1883 Magazine elaborates on the comprehensive concept where the group members exist as pirates in search of their treasure.

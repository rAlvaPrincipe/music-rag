    "text": "Buzy was a Japanese female pop music group, made up of members Nao Tōyama, Mayumi Niwa, Mao Miyazato, Yurisa Asama, Sachiko Iwanaga and Yumi Takeda. The group originally formed in 1998 as COLOR and consisted of Tōyama, Miyazato, Niwa, and Komugi Kadota, and released five singles and two albums between 1999 and 2001. As Buzy, they released their first single \"Kujira\" in 2004. They are well known for the song \"Be Somewhere\", used as the opening theme of the anime series Rockman EXE Stream, back in 2005. They also performed the opening theme song for Twin Spica, \"Venus Say\", a version of \"Kujira\" with different lyrics. The group's name stands for \"Blend, Unique, Zipping, and You just wait.\" Many of their songs were written and composed by Porno Graffitti guitarist and lyricist Haruichi Shindō.

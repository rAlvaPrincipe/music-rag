Even though Manzur was an outcast and Peter was part of the popular crowd, their love of 1980s/90s memorabilia brought them together, and they became best friends very quickly.\nAfter graduating from university, Manzur spent all of his time re-creating the sound of his childhood. With no previous knowledge of electronic production, he used a laptop, a MIDI keyboard and Reason. Iqbal and Carrol joined to form Futurecop!. They have said Futurecop! is the discovery of life and beyond.\nFuturecop! released their second full-length album, Hopes, Dreams & Alienation, in December 2013. An album influenced by angst and their favourite electro influences such as Justice. Remixes came from Lifelike, Pony Pony Run Run, Anamanaguchi, Strange Talk and Teen Daze. It received favourable reviews from blogs such as Noisey, MTV Iggy, Data Transmission and Indie Shuffle.\nOn 23 November 2018, Futurecop! released a new single \"Edge Of The Universe\" with Canadian synth-pop band Parallels on American label New Retrowave. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EP ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

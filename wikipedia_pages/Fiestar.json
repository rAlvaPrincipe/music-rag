The show began on July 2 at the Blue Square Samsung Card Hall. The same year, Fiestar also participated in a video series entitled \"Fiestar's A-HA! For the Global K-Pop Fan\" as well as endorsements for the Samsung Galaxy S4.\nOn August 27, a pre-release single, \"Whoo!\" featuring Eric Benét, was released online. Despite there being no live promotions for the single, it was a chart success.\nIn September, LOEN Entertainment created the sub-label Collabodadi, under which Fiestar would continue to release their music. On November 1, the group released the single \"I Don't Know\" on the EP Curious, making their stage comeback on Music Core the following day. Following promotions, the reality television show Channel FIESTAR! aired on SBS MTV.\n\n\n=== 2014–2015: Cheska's departure and Black Label ===\nOn March 20, 2014, LOEN Entertainment announced that Cheska would be leaving the group and would not be replaced by any new members, and Fiestar's comeback was scheduled for mid-July after being postponed due to the Sewol ferry tragedy.\nOn June 16, a single in collaboration between The Friends and Fiestar for the 2014 Brazil World Cup titled \"I Love Korea\" was released. On July 1, the music video for the single \"One More\" was released.\n\nOn March 4, 2015, Fiestar's first mini album, Black Label, was released with the title track \"You're Pitiful\". Six months after the album's release, on September 22, Collabodadi was dissolved, with LOEN Tree becoming the sole in-house label of LOEN Entertainment. Thus, Fiestar returned to LOEN Tree after a two-year run under Collabodadi.\nOn December 17, Cao Lu appeared on Radio Star as a guest along with rapper Jessi, Got7's Jackson, and Lena Park as part of the Outsiders special. She gained national attention for her appearance on the program and became the number one trending topic on Naver, with Fiestar also trending.\n\n\n=== 2016–2018: Last activities and disbandment ===\nIn March 2016, Fiestar released their second mini album A Delicate Sense. The album consists of six tracks, including lead single \"Mirror\". Notably, all the members also participated in the production.\nOn May 31, 2016, Fiestar returned with the digital single \"Apple Pie\".\nOn May 15, 2018, after a year of no group activities, it was announced that Fiestar had officially disbanded following the expiration of four of the members' contracts on April 30 and Cao Lu's contract would be expiring on May 31.\nOn May 29, 2018, former member Cheska announced via her Instagram that she was leaving Korea and quitting music. She thanked her fans for supporting her, but stated that she decided to walk away as \"music was slowly killing [her]\".\n\n\n=== 2024–present: Reunion ===\nOn August 27 it was reported that Fiestar would reunite with the release of a new song on August 31 to commemorate their 12th debut anniversary. On August 29, Fiestar appeared together on Cao Lu's YouTube channel and confirmed that they would reunite with the release of a remake of their 2015 single \"You're Pitiful\", their first independent release. Cao Lu also cited that the single's copyright was already bought by her. Their remake single \"You're Pitiful\" was officially released on August 31, with a new style which combined \"UK Garage\" and \"Rage Pop\" genres.\n\n\n== \"One More\" controversy ==\nFiestar's single \"One More\" was banned from broadcast by MBC for its supposedly risqué lyrics. While the song had originally passed scrutiny from the three major broadcasting stations (KBS, MBC and SBS), backlash from public commentators forced the networks to review the song's content. While their representatives claimed that the song was innocuous, the group re-recorded the song and changed the lyrics. The controversy spawned from the lyrics prompted MBC to crack down further on songs with ambiguous or easily misconstrued lyrical content.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCao Lu (차오루)\nJei (재이)\nLinzy (린지)\nHyemi (혜미)\nYezi (예지)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n=== Soundtrack appearances ===\n\n\n=== Other appearances ===\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nFiestar on LOEN Entertainment"

    "text": "The Symphony of Science is a music project created by Washington-based electronic musician John D. Boswell. The project seeks to \"spread scientific knowledge and philosophy through musical remixes.\"  Boswell uses pitch-corrected audio and video samples from television programs featuring popular educators and scientists. The audio and video clips are mixed into digital mashups and scored with Boswell's original compositions. Two of Boswell's music videos, \"A Glorious Dawn\" and \"We are All Connected\", feature appearances from Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, and Stephen Hawking. The audio and video is sampled from popular science television shows including Cosmos, The Universe, The Eyes of Nye, The Elegant Universe, and Stephen Hawking's Universe.\nUnruly Media, a video tracking service, first charted \"A Glorious Dawn\" on September 21, 2009. A month later, the video had received more than a million views and was ranked in the music category on YouTube as one of the top-rated videos of all time.  On November 9, 2009, Third Man Records released a 7-inch single of \"A Glorious Dawn\" for the 75th anniversary of the birth of Carl Sagan. According to Discogs.com, there were a total of 5 different vinyl records produced, including a limited edition 8-inch single given out only at South by Southwest 2010.\n\n\n== John D. Boswell ==\n\nBorn in Idaho, John Boswell attended Gonzaga Preparatory School and graduated from Western Washington University in 2008 with a degree in economics. Soon after, Boswell started Colorpulse, an electronica music project, and began to focus on production. \nBoswell had been experimenting with sampling and remixing for some time before creating his first YouTube videos. Boswell had worked with Auto-Tune in the past and thought people might be interested in hearing American astronomer Carl Sagan sing. He first saw Cosmos in 2004 and soon after bought the set of DVDs. Boswell looked through these episodes for \"profound quotes\" that lacked music in the background. Once he found these quotes, Boswell Auto-Tuned Sagan's voice and picked from the best ones. After completing what became \"A Glorious Dawn\", Boswell posted the video on YouTube in September 2009 and to his surprise, the video went viral within a week. To date, the video has received nearly ten million views and is ranked as one of the top rated videos of all time in the music category.\nHe released an album in 2010, titled Escaping the Tangle, which included some of these productions. His music project Symphony of Science \"aims to spread scientific knowledge and philosophy through musical remixes\" and to \"deliver scientific knowledge and philosophy in musical form\". In addition to Symphony of Science, Boswell is also working on a project called Remixes for the Soul, as well as scientific-based films, most notably Timelapse of the Future, under the moniker Melodysheep.\nBoswell lives in Seattle.\n\n\n== Music and video ==\n\n\n=== A Glorious Dawn ===\n\nBoswell's first video in the Symphony of Science series is 3 minutes, 34 seconds long and features Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking. Samples include clips from Cosmos (1980) and Stephen Hawking's Universe (1997).  On September 21, 2009, Unruly Media, a viral video tracking service, began to chart the popularity of the video.  At the end of the first week of October, the video had received 800,000 views and, by the end of the month, more than a million. By the end of 2010, the video had surpassed 5 million views.\nThe title takes its name from the chorus spoken by Carl Sagan, remixed from an episode of Cosmos.\nThird Man Records released a 7-inch recording of \"A Glorious Dawn\" on November 9, 2009, in honor of the 75th anniversary of the birth of Carl Sagan.  The one-sided single was created by United Record Pressing in a unique \"Cosmos Colored Vinyl\", limited pressing of 150 copies; it was then re-pressed on regular vinyl in a larger run.  The flipside is etched with a copy of the diagram found on the Voyager Golden Record.\n\"A Glorious Dawn\" is the first ever record to be played in space.\n\n\n=== We Are All Connected ===\n\nThe second video in the series is 4 minutes, 12 seconds in length and features Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Bill Nye. It was released on October 19, 2009. Audio and video samples are taken from The History Channel's Universe series, Carl Sagan's Cosmos, interviews with Richard Feynman in 1983, Neil deGrasse Tyson's cosmic sermon, and Bill Nye's The Eyes of Nye series. Additional visuals come from NOVA's The Elegant Universe, Stephen Hawking's Universe, and Cosmos, among others. On January 23, 2010, the video was shown at the South Nassau Unitarian Universalist Church in Long Island NY, as part of a youth-directed service. The video has been used in other churches and classrooms.\nThe title comes from the chorus spoken by Neil deGrasse Tyson and remixed by Boswell:\n\n\n=== Our Place in the Cosmos ===\n\nThe third video in the series is 4 minutes, 21 seconds in length and was released on November 23, 2009.  \"Our Place in the Cosmos\" features Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, Michio Kaku, and Robert Jastrow.  Samples were taken from Cosmos, Genius of Charles Darwin, a TED talk, Stephen Hawking's Universe, interviews and visuals from Baraka and Koyaanisqatsi, History Channel's Universe series, and Cosmic Voyage.\nThe title comes from words spoken by Carl Sagan and remixed by Boswell:\n\n\n=== The Unbroken Thread ===\n\nThe fourth video in the series is 4 minutes in length and was released on January 6, 2010. \"The Unbroken Thread\" is themed around biology and evolution rather than the cosmos, and features Carl Sagan, David Attenborough, and Jane Goodall.\nThe video uses clips from Cosmos, several David Attenborough documentaries (Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life, The Life of Mammals, The Living Planet, and BBC Life), XVIVO Scientific Animations, IMAX Cosmic Voyage, Jane Goodall's TED Talk, and a Guinness commercial.\nThe title comes from Sagan's Cosmos.\n\n\n=== The Poetry of Reality (An Anthem for Science) ===\nThe fifth installment uses clips from various prominent scientists and speakers - including Jacob Bronowski, Sagan, Feynman, Dawkins, Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking, PZ Myers, Lawrence Krauss, Michael Shermer, and deGrasse Tyson - to explain and promote science, its process, and its benefits. The video was released on February 25, 2010.

It features Sagan, Robert Zubrin, Brian Cox, and Penelope Boston, and it features clips from The Mars Underground (2007), Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, and Wonders of the Solar System. The video was released on June 3, 2010. The title of this song stems from Zubrin's book The Case For Mars. The chorus is sung by Sagan and Cox.\n\nIncidentally, The Case for Mars (Instrumental) is also used as the theme tune for the British short film/ pilot, The Black Room.\n\n\n=== A Wave of Reason ===\n\nThe seventh installment, released on November 23, 2010, is about reasoning and skepticism. It features Carl Sagan, Bertrand Russell, Sam Harris, Michael Shermer, Lawrence Krauss, Carolyn Porco, Richard Dawkins, Richard Feynman, Phil Plait, and James Randi. It is intended to promote scientific reasoning and skepticism in the face of growing amounts of pseudoscientific pursuits, such as Astrology and Homeopathy, and also to \"promote the scientific worldview as equally enlightening as religion.\" The chorus is sung by Dawkins, except for the last line which is Phil Plait's:\n\n\n=== The Big Beginning ===\n\n\"The Big Beginning\" is the eighth installment in the Symphony of Science music video series, released on January 20, 2011. It deals with the origins of our universe, covering the Big Bang theory, expansion and cooling of the universe, formation of galaxies, the interplay between matter and anti-matter, and cosmic radiation.

The chorus is the English greeting on the record: \"Hello from the children of planet Earth.\" The music video ends with a Morse code message spelling out Per aspera ad astra, meaning \"Through hardships to the stars.\"\n\n\n== Related projects ==\n\n\n=== Symphony of Bang Goes The Theory ===\nNot strictly part of the Symphony of Science series as this was made for the BBC science show Bang Goes the Theory, it nevertheless uses the same formula of pitch correction of spoken words over an original music track. It celebrates the tantalising questions that science throws up, as well as being an entertaining showreel for the show itself. In addition to the four presenters - Liz Bonnin, Dallas Campbell, Jem Stansfield, and Yan Wong -  there are guest spots for Jim Al-Khalili and Tara Shears. The clips are all taken from the TV show or its website.\nThe chorus is sung by Yan Wong.\n\n\n=== PBS Digital Studios ===\nWhile not strictly part of the Symphony of Science series, Boswell uses the same formula of pitch correction of spoken words over an original music track. Made for the Public Broadcasting Service's PBS Digital Studios, various clips from present and past PBS programming are sampled to make these songs.\n\n\n=== Carl Sagan Tribute Series by Milky Way Musings ===\nSimilarly, another science inspired music project came about during the period in which Symphony of Science had gone viral. The Carl Sagan Tribute Series featured snippets of the COSMOS television series episodes and Carl Sagan overlaid with select music recordings. According to the creator, Callum C. J. Sutherland of Toronto, Canada,\n\"Milky Way Musings is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting scientific literacy, supporting funding for scientific research and providing creative and educational science programming that is accessible to everyone\".\n\n\n=== The Sagan and Feynman Series by Reid Gower ===\nFounded by Reid Gower of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, The Sagan Series and The Feynman Series were also a byproduct of the same era spawned by Boswell's Symphony of Science. Although neither of them collaborated, both music video projects had similar themes, incorporating popularizers of science and science education set to musical melodies and inspirational themes.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nMusician Carrie Brownstein found the idea behind Symphony of Science \"quite beautiful and amazing in both its sincerity and aims\". She also enjoyed the \"hip-hop stylings\" of the camera angle on Bill Nye while he is moving his hands around and expressing himself on \"We Are All Connected\". Writer Nick Sagan, son of Carl Sagan, was impressed with \"A Glorious Dawn\", giving it a favorable review and stamp of approval. Sagan writes, \"John Boswell over at Colorpulse Music is a mad genius, sampling both Cosmos and Stephen Hawking's Universe series into three minutes and thirty-four seconds of pure, concentrated awesomeness... Love it, love it, love it. Dad would have loved it, too.\"\nColumnist Franklin Harris argues that Boswell's videos show that science can arouse the minds of artists just as much as religion and mythology have in the past. Harris calls the videos \"art for the Information Age, inspired by science\".\nNew Music Transmission, a podcast who featured Symphony of Science in 2009, gave \"A Glorious Dawn\" positive reviews and called Symphony of Science as \"A thinking man's Pogo\", referring to the Australian electro artist who was featured 2 weeks before.\n\nChristopher Jion, of Dirgefunk Records, has praised Symphony of Science saying, \"When I first heard John Boswell's \"A Glorious Dawn,\" it brought tears to my eyes, it was life-changing. The original idea was to release a compilation of space and science-themed tracks from a handful of artists I like (of course, including some Symphony Of Science tracks). But as John kept releasing new Symphony Of Science material it became very obvious that it deserved its own album, and, as it's an ongoing project, perhaps there will be more volumes to follow. This CD is a gift from me to anyone listening who has a passion for music and science. It was paid for out of my own pocket with nothing expected in return. It's free to anyone who'll appreciate its ideas and messages. Dirgefunk Records does not exist for profit Its sole existence is to release material for the enjoyment of myself and likeminded persons. So, enjoy.

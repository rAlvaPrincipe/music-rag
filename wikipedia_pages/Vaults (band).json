They released their first EP, Vultures, later in the same year. After being signed to Virgin EMI in 2014, Vaults released debut major-label single \"Lifespan\", followed by \"Vultures\".

The last few years have been equally amazing and very challenging, both on personal and professional levels. After caught in still was released we took some much needed time off, but when we discussed how we might go forward it became clear that the spark you need to make a band work had gone. We leave on good terms, with some amazing memories and feeling very proud of the record we put out. Thanks from the bottom of our hearts to everyone that ever came to a gig, caught us at a festival, or bought a record, and everyone from management to label to live team that's ever worked with us. It's meant the world to us. Much love BB&B x\" Pepino now performs with the band Mesadorm (originally founded in 2015), who released debut album, Heterogaster, on 11 May 2018, while Ben Vella formed the band Child of the Parish, with his brother Tom and the artist Pius Bak.\nIn June 2024, 38-year-old Blythe Pepino was credited with her first solo hit after the Sonny Fodera's track \"Mind Still\", on which she is the featured vocalist, moved into the Top 75 at number 74.\n\n\n== Personal lives ==\nIn early 2016, Pepino was interviewed about her polyamorous relationship with boyfriend Tom Jacob by The Independent.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n== References =="

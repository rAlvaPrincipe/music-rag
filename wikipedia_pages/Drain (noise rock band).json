    "text": "Drain were an American noise rock band formed in Austin, Texas by King Coffey in 1991. The group also included David McCreath on guitar and bassist Owen McMahon of Cherubs. Along with the psychedelic leanings of Coffey's other band the Butthole Surfers, Drain also ventures into electronic and techno music territory. Also, samplers and drum machines play a stronger role in the music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\"A Black Fist\" b/w \"Flower Mound\" (1991)\nPick Up Heaven (1992)\nOffspeed and In There (1996)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDrain at AllMusic\nDrain discography at Discogs"

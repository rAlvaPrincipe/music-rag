    "text": "Grand Analog is a Canadian hip hop band, fronted by Odario Williams. The project combines R&B, jazz, reggae and rock influences into a hip hop style performed mainly on live instruments instead of digital electronics.\n\n\n== History ==\nGrand Analog was first formed by Williams in 2002 as a short-lived rock-oriented side project from his main band Mood Ruff. After Mood Ruff's breakup, he revived the project with a new focus on reggae and hip hop in 2006. Williams has told the press that \"sonically, I knew that I wanted to dig into dub and rock and soul. I’ve always wanted to do that, but years ago I wasn’t free enough upstairs to know that I could.\"\nThe band released their first album, Calligraffiti, in 2007. A follow-up album, titled Metropolis Is Burning, was released on May 26, 2009. The album topped the Canadian community and campus radio hip hop chart for several weeks.\nGrand Analog won two Western Canadian Music Awards for Best Rap/Hip-Hop Recording in 2009 for Touch Your Toes EP and 2010 for Metropolis Is Burning.\nThe band's third album, Modern Thunder, was released in Canada on August 20, 2013. Modern Thunder was also released in various European countries on German label Ferryhouse Records; and released in the U.S. on Brooklyn label Feel Up Records.\nIn 2015 the band released an album, Roll Dub Soul Rap, and performed at a number of clubs in western Canada., In 2016 they released a video, Love is a Battlefield.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nCalligraffiti (2007)\nMetropolis Is Burning (2009)\nModern Thunder (2013)\nRoll Dub Soul Rap (2015)\nSurvival (2018)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nFeelup Records"

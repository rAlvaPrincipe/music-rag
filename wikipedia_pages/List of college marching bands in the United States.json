    "text": "College marching bands in the United States are frequently associated with college football and their performance activities often (but don't always) revolve around the sport. In the context of football, marching bands can be seen on the field both at pregame and at halftime, and performing in the stands during the game. College marching bands can also be found performing in parades such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and Rose Parade and performing in exhibition at high school marching band competitions such as those run by Bands of America and USBands. There are several styles of marching bands typically found at American colleges and universities. \nSchools with prominent football programs in the power 5 conferences typically field traditional,  Big Ten-style show bands, whose repertoire largely consists of popular music. They often perform a different half time show at each home game and frequently use a high march style.\nThough sharing similarities with other show bands, the marching bands of HBCUs have a style, status, and legacy that differs significantly from bands at other institutions. The bands' repertoire costists largely of Hip Hop and R&B. The reach of HBCU bands extends far beyond the universities they represent and they are renowned for their contributions to black culture. The most famous exhibition of HBCU bands is the Honda Battle of the Bands.\nMany Mid-major and FCS schools field corps-style bands drawing inspiration from Drum Corps International. Corps-style bands typically field a single show that is refined and performed throughout the season, These shows often have intricate drill, technical musical passages, and thematic choreography.\nMilitary marching bands at academies and senior military colleges have a more traditional regimental style. They are military units made up either of cadets or full time active duty personnel.\nScramble bands are a type of band often found at selective universities such as those in the Ivy League. Instead of marching set to set, scramble bands often run or \"scramble\" between sets. Unlike most other marching bands which are led by faculty, scramble bands tend to be student led.\n\n\n== List ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Takashi Nikaido (Japanese: 二階堂高嗣, Hepburn: Takashi Nikaidō, born August 6, 1990) is a Japanese actor and singer who is a member of boy band Kis-My-Ft2 and its derivative group Busaiku (舞祭組) \nunder Starto Entertainment. His nickname is Nika and Nika-chan.\n\n\n== History ==\nNikaido's older sister was a fan of the Kinki Kids and sent Nikaido's resume to the Johnny & Associates when he was 10 years old. He said his sister told him that he was going to a Kinki Kids concert today and took him to the audition site. After auditioning, he joined Johnny & Associates in February 2001. At the same audition venue were Toshiya Miyata and Wataru Yokoo, who later became members of Kis-My-Ft2.\nHe was only 10 years old when he entered show business, and it is said that he had a rebellious period due to the frustration of not being able to CD debut quickly. At the Johnny's, which had a strict hierarchical relationship, he surprised everyone by calling his seniors without an honorific title. When he met Shingo Katori of SMAP, the most successful group in Johnny's at the time, he scared everyone by saying, \"Who are you?.\" But he is said to have had a strange charm that did not make people hate him for it. \nAfter joining several groups as a trainee (Johnny's Jr.), he was selected as a member of Kis-My-Ft2 in 2005, and he made his CD debut with Everybody Go on August 10, 2011, seven years after their formation.\nIn 2001, he made his first drama appearance in Fuji TV's \"NO KISS\".\nIn 2011, he made his first film appearance in the movie \"Ogawa no be\"小川の辺.\nOn December 13, 2013, Busaiku was formed from Kis-My-Ft2 with Kento Senga, Toshiya Miyata and Wataru Yokoo produced by Masahiro Nakai who was a member of SMAP.\nHe is physically strong and a good acrobat, often performing somersaults and backflips at live shows. He is also a good rapper and often raps in Kis-My-Ft2's songs. In Kis-My-Ft2, he is in charge of live direction.\nHe loves solo camping and opened his personal official YouTube channel on the theme of camping in December 2023.\nOn September 15, 2024, he announced that he would take a temporary hiatus due to health problems. He had been absent from the final day performance of Kis-My-Ft2's concert tour Kis-My-Ft2 Dome Tour 2024 Synopsis on September 8 due to health problems.\n\n\n== Nakai's Watch ==\nMasahiro Nakai is known for taking care of his junior members of Johnny's, and Kis-My-Ft2 members are said to be especially fond of him as his direct juniors. In 2016, four members of Busaiku had dinner with Nakai, who had produced busaiku, Nikaido was given a luxury watch by Nakai. The watch was a Franck Muller wristwatch that Nakai bought it for himself on his 30th birthday, Nikaido jokingly asked, \"It's a nice watch. I want it,\" and Nakai removed the watch on the spot and gave it to Nikaido as a real gift. Since then, Nikaido always wore this watch, appeared on TV and at concerts, and at every occasion mentioned that it was a watch given to him by Nakai. Nakai had told him, \"When you turn 30, buy your own watch,\" so in 2021, the 10th anniversary of Kis-My-Ft2's debut, Nikaido bought a limited edition watch at Franck Muller. Nikaido is said to have great respect for Nakai, and often appears at Kis-My-Ft2 concerts wearing a hat, as Nakai did when he was in SMAP.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nJossy Matsumura=Takashi Nikaido\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== TV Drama ===\nDigital photo drama \"NO KISS\" (September 25, 2001, Fuji TV) – played the role of Yoshihiko in his elementary school days (reminiscent scene)\nBAD BOYS J (April 7, 2013 – June 23, 2013, Nippon TV) – Danno Hidenori role\nWoman Contractor – The Trap of a Trapped Woman (September 12, 2014, Fuji TV) – Shunsaku Kogure as Shunsaku\nHeisei Maisakigumi Otoko (October 18, 2014 – January 4, 2015, Nippon TV) – as Takatsugu Nikaido, the group lead\nWhy was my family erased?

    "text": "The British Blues Quintet were a British band formed in 2006 by five musicians,  known for their interpretations of blues music. The line-up included keyboardist and singer Zoot Money, drummer Colin Allen, vocalist Maggie Bell, bassist Colin Hodgkinson and guitarist Miller Anderson. They recorded a live album, Live in Glasgow (Recorded at The Ferry) (2007). As a result of differences due to the participation of some band members in Jon Lord Blues Project, Colin Allen disbanded the British Blues Quintet in 2013.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nLive in Glasgow (Recorded at The Ferry) (2007), Angel Air\n\n\n== References =="

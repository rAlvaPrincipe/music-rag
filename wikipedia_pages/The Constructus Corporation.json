    "text": "The Constructus Corporation were a South African electronic music group.\n\n\n== Formation of the band ==\nFollowing the breakup of Watkin Tudor Jones' project Max Normal in 2002, Jones moved from Johannesburg to Cape Town and began collaborating with DJ Dope of Krushed & Sorted and Felix Laband on the music for a multi-media project he had conceptualized, involving a graphic novel with a soundtrack and live show. These sessions spawned the \"Man With No Name\" track on African Dope's Cape of Good Dope compilation in 2002, which later gradually mutated into The Constructus Corporation outfit.\n\n\n== The Ziggurat ==\nThe Constructus Corporation's debut album, The Ziggurat, was released in 2002. It was a concept album, telling the story of a young rapper named Random Boy and his best friend, Kidtronic. The two protagonists live on a floating pyramid in outer space called the Ziggurat, and must save it from an entity known as the Constructus Corporation. It featured an accompanying graphic novel illustrated by Nikhil Singh.\nThe Ziggurat was Tudor Jones' first collaboration with vocalist Anri du Toit, who is now one half of Die Antwoord under the name Yolandi Visser, along with Tudor Jones. At the time, du Toit used the name Anica The Snuffling.\n\n\n== Post-breakup and future tenures ==\nFollowing the release of The Ziggurat, the Constructus Corporation disbanded, prompted largely by the record label's failure to release their album on time. Watkin Tudor Jones since expanded into the graphic arts field, fluffy toy-making and other creative outlets, releasing two more projects, such as the Watkin Tudor Jones solo project (also known as Fucknrad, with Sibot) and the multimedia project MaxNormal.TV (not to be confused with his other outlet, Max Normal) with Anri du Toit, who later had a daughter with Watkin named Sixteen Jones. Sibot and Markus Wormstorm later collaborated on the 3-CD album The Real Estate Agents, and Felix Laband went on to be signed by distinguished German independent label Compost Records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nThe Ziggurat (2002)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscography at discogs.com\nAlbum page on African Dope\nSecond CD download page\nBand page on Tunetree\nArtwork scan\nA short summary of the story of The Ziggurat, by Waddy Jones"

    "text": "Bandabardò is an Italian folk rock band, it was formed in 1993.\nHe immediately devoted himself to an intense live activity in Italy and France. Their recording debut dates back to 1996 with Il circo mangione (winner of the Ciampi Award for best debut of the year), followed by Iniziali bì-bì, which contains their first hit Beppeanna. After the mini-live Barbaro tour they publish Se mi rilasso... collasso, a live that contains the studio version of Manifesto, another piece of immediate success. In 2000 Mojito Football Club was released, followed by Bondo! Bondo! and from another tour in Spain, France and Switzerland and after a while Jose Ramon Caraballo Armas, better known as Ramon, joins the formation on winds and percussion. Three steps forward in 2004, produced by Carlo U. Rossi is another top ten success and in the same year the autobiography “Vento in faccia”, written with Massimo Cotto and published by Arcana, and a DVD are published with the same title which documents the opening concert of the new tour recorded in Florence, their city.\nIn 2006 it was the turn of the Fuori Orario collection, a double CD also containing unreleased tracks which still hits the FIMI top ten (and takes first place in the charts of independent sales outlets). Incessant live activity in Italy and abroad, they also play in Mexico where, in support of the Zapatista communities and in collaboration with the Ya-Basta! they finance the \"Semillita del Sol\" project, for the schooling of the indigenous populations of Chiapas. After a tour in Canada, Ottavio was released, followed by a theatrical tour.\nIn 2010, for XL magazine, they published Allegro ma non troppo (containing two unreleased songs and live performances) and in the same year, together with the Save the Children association, they participated in a schooling project in northern Ethiopia, making Sette x uno together with Dario Fo, Giobbe Covatta, David Riondino, Enzo Iacchetti, Davide Enia and Ascanio Celestini.\nAfter the release of Scaccianuvole (2011) there is a 3-year break before arriving at the unreleased album entitled L'improbabile which marks their return to a major label since Initiali Bì-Bì (this time with Warner) and the keyboardist Federico “Pacio” Pacini joined the line-up. In the meantime, the band created the soundtrack for the film \"L'Universale\", by Federico Micali, which was released in theaters in April 2016 while Sky Arte dedicated a docufilm to them entitled \"Bandabardò, un mistero italiano\", with Carlo Lucarelli.\nAfter another European tour with stops in London, Dublin, Amsterdam and Berlin, in 2018 a new version of Beppeanna entitled Se mi rilasso collasso was released on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the birth of the band. The song sees the participation of Stefano Bollani, Caparezza, Carmen Consoli, Daniele Silvestri and Max Gazzè followed, on December 7, 2018, by a party-concert at the Nelson Mandela Forum in Florence where the Band celebrates together with Max Gazzè, Carmen Consoli, Tonino Carotone, Modena City Ramblers, Cisco and Piero Pelù.\nStill live in 2019, they reach 1640 concerts on the last date of the 2019 Summer Tour.\nOn February 14, 2021, Enrico \"Erriquez\" Greppi disappears due to an incurable disease.\nA year later the band communicated its intention to continue its activity, announcing a collaboration with his friend Cisco.\nOn May 20, 2022, Non fa paura was released, an album created together with Cisco, followed by a new tour.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1992 - 2001: Formation and the first years ===\nThe story begins in 1992, when Erriquez had left Vidia and Finaz was studying at the University of Pisa and was a musician. The two shared some collaborations with Litfiba and from there they met, even if they were not yet friends at the time.\nOne day Gianni Maroccolo had called them both to work on Andrea Chimenti's album and summer tour, Erriquez would have played the acoustic guitar and would have been the backing vocalist while Finaz would have played the electric guitar.\nThe two got on so well that Erriquez suggests that they form a group in the Mano Negra style but with the acoustic part amplified, without renouncing the rock style. At first Finaz was uncertain but after attending a Les VRP concert he decides to accept Erriquez's offer. Soon Don Bachi on bass, Nuto on drums, Orla on second guitar and Paolino on percussion join the band.\nBandabardò was born on March 8, 1993, in a rehearsal room in Sesto Fiorentino, the name is a tribute to Brigitte Bardot.\nThe newborn band begins a tour in Italy and France playing in clubs and also on the street.\nThe first concert was at the Ark of Follonica, on stilts, with super guests Litfiba for the aftershow, the following evening they would play in Prato, the problem is that before calling themselves bandabardò the group had already set the date before that of Follonica, so for that evening they perform as W Fernandez.\nIn 1994 the band created its first EP entitled La BandaBardò, a CD of 4 songs that we will find in the second album of the group (with the exception of Ho la testa), created for purely promotional purposes, for this choice the manager of the time, Natalie Chaineux decides to abandon the project as he did not approve of the idea of self-production.\nThe first album, Il circo mangione, was released on June 4, 1996, with the independent label Cockney Music, achieved great success, also winning the Ciampi Award for best debut album, even if the critics often ignored them. The album sees the participation of Piero Pelù who does the backing vocals in the song W Fernandez.\nBetween 1996 and 1997 the band began to collaborate with the booking agency OTR (On the road) and to have Francesco Barbaro as their manager, in August of the same year the band should have gone to Rimini to participate in the Match festival Music (filmed on satellite channel), but due to a car accident the band lost the date, there was no damage but the fake news of the bass player's death began to spread.\nSuccess is confirmed with the second album, Iniziali Bì-Bì, released on March 31, 1998, with the BMG Ricordi label, and with its single Beppeanna with which the band manages to gain fame, the video clip was broadcast on Videomusic\nThis second album, according to the band itself, best represents their live sounds with an acoustic and songwriting sound and with guests such as Cisco and Stefano Bollani.\nIn 1999 a limited edition live album, Barbaro tour, was released, much appreciated by critics, who at the time did not look favorably on live albums.\nHowever, things were not going very well, the band continued to be constantly ignored by the Italian musical environment and therefore they decided to leave OTR and go to Mescal.\nOn January 28, 2000, the third album, Mojito Football Club, was released on the BMG Ricordi label, appreciated both by critics, thanks to its acoustic sounds but with a small tendency towards electronics and rock, and by last-minute fans , but not by those who followed them from the beginning for their change of style.\nThe official video clip of Vento in faccia was broadcast on TMC 2, but unfortunately BMG Ricordi decides to fire the band just two months after the release of the album and leaving the band members disheartened by Mescal.\nAt that point the band split into three parts, on one side there was Erriquez who wanted to stay in Mescal while on the other there were Finaz, Nuto and Paolino who wanted to go back to OTR instead, and finally Don Bachi and Orla didn't they had a precise position, thus creating a strong commotion and furious quarrels among the band members, even Finaz thought of abandoning the group.\nEventually though, after nearly three months of arguing the band members decide to stop arguing and Erriquez chooses to take a step back and accept the idea of returning to OTR.\nIt is therefore decided to restart, the concerts of the autumn period of the Mojito F.C. Tour are recorded. Tour, moreover a new unpublished, Manifesto is written, the problem is that by now the band lacked a record label again, and nobody was willing to take them after the dismissal from Ricordi, so the manager Francesco Barbaro made sure that the OTR would be also become a label, as well as a booking agency, relying on Venus Distribuzioni.\nIn 2001 the second live album Se mi rilasso... collasso was released, considered by the critics one of the few live albums worth listening to, since the band has made its concerts its battlefield, is in absolute best selling album of the band.\nIn the same year the band was invited to the Enzimi Festival in Rome to pay homage to Rino Gaetano together with Raiz, Max Gazzè, Paola Turci, Roberto Angelini, Sergio Cammariere and many others, the festival registered around 40,000 people.\n\n\n=== 2002-2003: Bondo! Bondo! ===\nOn September 6, 2002, the band released Bondo! Bondo! produced by Gianluca Vaccaro, his single Sette sono i re is broadcast on RaiStereoDue, obtains international success with a European tour in Spain, France and Switzerland.\nIt has a different style from the previous ones, a genre tending towards light rock and sees the collaboration with Max Gazzè; is highly praised by both fans and critics as it is considered the most elaborate and complex album of their career. It contains a strong political criticism of Silvio Berlusconi.\nSeventh place among the best-selling records in Italy in the FIMI ranking.\nIn the same year the band plays at the Concerto del Primo Maggio for the first time in their career, with guest Paola Turci.\nAfter Paolino's exit from the group, who will accompany Piero Pelù, on the summer tour Bondo! Bondo! Tour of 2002 Ugo Nativi of Malfunk takes turns on percussion, performing on MTV's Brand New Tour.\nFrom 2003 he joined the Ramón line-up, on wind instruments and percussion.\nAlso in the same year the band performed at MTV Day 2003.\n\n\n=== 2004-2005: Tre passi avanti ===\nThe next album, Tre passi avanti, was released on April 25, 2004, produced by Carlo Rossi, a meaner album than the previous ones according to Erriquez himself, in the album we can hear Spanish and Cuban sounds thanks to Ramon's influence.\nThe photographic set for the cover was set up in the Pettini’s park in Florence, however Ramon is missing from the cover as he is in Rome.\nIn the same year the autobiography of the Banda was published, written with Massimo Cotto and entitled Vento in faccia, from the song of the same name (published by Arcana). Wind in the face is also the title of the DVD which contains the opening concert of the Three Steps Forward Tour, in Florence, as well as backstage shots and messages from the fans.\nIn the same year the band plays at the May Day Concert always having Paola Turci as a guest.\n\n\n=== 2006-2010: The golden years ===\nIn 2006 the band played at the Concerto del Primo Maggio, presented by Claudio Bisio.\nSeptember 1st 2006 marks the recording comeback of the Florentine band with the collection Fuori Orario which, surprisingly, receives excellent feedback: first in the charts of independent outlets and seventh in the large chains, after listening to a concert by the Band during one of his trips European, Mutsumi Kuboutchi, artistic director of Vivid Sound, one of the major Japanese independent labels, becomes a fan of the bandabardò and decides to publish their records and the collection Fuori Orario in Japan as well (the publication of the other albums will soon follow), but they will also be released in Canada.\nIn the same year the band performed on Rock TV live from the Rolling Stone in Milan.\nIn 2007 the band performs once again at the May Day Concert together with the Bandão.\nOttavio was released on September 5, 2008, for On the road, after the Tour in Canada.\nA concept album that narrates Ottavio's love story in a tragicomic style, recalling new sounds and a more theatrical style and Combat folk, with influences from Tarantelle, country music, ballads and rock.\nThe album includes a CD of 14 tracks and a DVD, in which Bandabardò tells the story of the birth of the project, backstage, special guests, writing and finishing the lyrics and music to then get to the realization of the disc.\nAppreciated by fans and critics both for its sound and for its complexity, but also for the collaborations with Tonino Carotone and Stefano Bollani, the album enters the top ten sales at the time of release and wins the Pimi Prize, and the Siae award for best independent album of the year.\nIn 2008 the Ottavio in Tour starts, thanks to a theatrical concept album the band will be able to perform in theaters in Rome, Naples, Florence and Bologna, with them there will be Clemente Ferrari on keyboards and accordion.\nIn 2009 the band plays again at the Concerto del Primo Maggio, this time with Tonino Carotone as a guest for his feat. in the single Child.\nOn April 29, 2010, Allegro ma non troppo was released, a special album for the magazine La Repubblica XL with a couple of unreleased songs, reinterpretations (made with Goran Bregović) and live.\nIn the same year Sette x uno was released, an album for the Save the Children campaign in collaboration with Dario Fo, David Riondino, Giobbe Covatta, Ascanio Celestini, Davide Enia and Enzo Iacchetti.\n\n\n=== 2011-2012: Scaccianuvole ===\nOn May 3, 2011, after 3 years, a new album of unreleased songs, Scaccianuvole, is released, an album that according to Erriquez himself is very reminiscent of the style of a vintage record, in fact the idea was precisely to give the feeling of being listening a vinyl from another time.\nThe novelty is that unlike other years and the independent spirit of the band, this time the record had been licensed to Universal Music Group, despite this it was the least promoted and least sold album in the entire history of the band, according to the itself this was a hurried album, a real misstep, both due to the absence of Ramon (who played with Daniele Silvestri at that time) and due to the not exactly happy historical period at the musical level (at the arrival of the streaming and piracy) and political.\nCompared to the other albums, this is considered by the critics a more melancholy album but with sounds now familiar to the band, less enthusiasm from the fans than usual.\nThat same year the band was invited to play the Francofolies Festival in France and the Luminato Festival in Toronto.\nFrom there the Scaccianuvole Tour starts, concluded in 2012, in the summer period the bandabardò does not have Ramon with it, but two temporary components are added on stage, Alberto Becucci on the accordion and Rocco Brunori on trumpet and percussion, who will give the band a more francophone.\nTo kick off the summer tour, the band plays at the May Day Concert, with guest Peppe Voltarelli, where they will also play the song Come i Beatles to present the album.\nThe winter period, on the other hand, is marked by the return of Ramon and the desire to add a keyboardist to the group, Federico Pacini, pianist from Quarrata, who had already played in the past with Orla and Nuto, so he is contacted by Finaz and becomes an official member of the band , known by the stage name of Pacio.\nAt the end of the tour the band decides to take a few years off from new songs.\nOn April 25 the show Itis Galileo was broadcast on LA7, Erriquez and Finaz had composed the final theme song.\n\n\n=== 2013-2016: L’improbabile ===\n2013 was for the band the year of break from concerts and tours, the only public performance of that year was at the Giffoni Film Festival.\nDuring this time Erriquez dedicated himself to producing and collaborating with other bands and singers including I Matti delle Giuncaie, Fabrizio Pocci and l'Orage, while Finaz dedicated himself to his solo career releasing his first album Guitar Solo, as well as also dedicating himself to the production of groups such as Folkabbestia, the Ratti della Sabina and Peppe Voltarelli.\nDon Bachi instead enters the Mozait with which they create their first album Pure Water, Orla instead writes the book The Rolling Stones (Futura editor, 2013) together with his friend Luca Remagi.\nAfter a year the band reunites and Erriquez and Finaz go alone to the Free University of Alcatraz to start writing their new album.\nOn May 27, 2014, The improbable was released, the first in their history made for a major label, Warner Music Group, which sparked a lot of controversy among fans since the group has always decided to remain independent.\nErriquez himself (together with Orla) has explained several times that the album was completed before the collaboration between them and the major and that the choice was above all to facilitate the possibility of buying the album on the market, compared to previous albums which were now out of production and difficult to find.\nUnlike the previous albums, this one deviates from the typical sound of the band, thus going to look for new styles, texts with phrases said in everyday life, on the street, among books, in the midst of interviews, according to the singer and guitarist year off was like opening the window in a room that smelled stale.\nThe first single is E allora il cuore, in which the guest-star Alessandra Contini, singer-bassist of Il Genio participates, in addition to this there is the collaboration with the rapper G-Max in the first song of the album, and the text of La selezione naturale written with Francesco Gazzè.\nIn 2016 the band created the soundtrack for the film L'Universale, by Federico Micali, which comes out in theaters in April.\nOn April 27, 2016, a reinterpretation of the song Lo sciopero del sole was released, in collaboration with the Gaudats Junk Band, this time the bandabardò decided to promote the recycling initiative, since the Gaudats Junk Band built its own instruments with waste taken from a landfill (old pipes, wine boxes, flip flops etc).\nThe band also performs at the May Day Concert, with the Gaudats Junk Band as a guest, where they will play their new single, and with an invitation from Erriquez to the whole audience: \"Let's throw away a little less, recycle, reuse, we reuse\".\nIn the same year the bandabardò made another European tour, called Lo sciopero del sole Tour, with stops in London, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dublin, Brussels and Esch-sur-Alzette (as well as many other dates throughout Italy).\n\n\n===

disease, his manager Francesco Barbaro communicated it.\nOn social media, the band releases the news with the singer's farewell letter.\nThe news comes unexpectedly as the singer decides not to reveal

Caparezza, Negrita and Paola Turci.\nAt the 2021 Sanremo Festival Roy Paci made a great dedication to Erriquez, putting on a t-shirt depicting his face and symbolically taking the stage with him,

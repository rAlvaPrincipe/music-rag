    "text": "Trumans Water are an American indie rock band, hailing from San Diego, California. They have released over a dozen albums over their career, on which they collaborated with acts in genre, including Azalia Snail, Chan Marshall and Thurston Moore.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTrumans Water was formed by the brothers Kirk and Kevin Branstetter, and the original drummer Jeff Jones in San Diego in 1991, after they were given a guitar and a bass guitar by a friend's father. They advertised for a \"lead singer, brain optional\", and recruited Glen Galloway as a result. Other members of the band have included Ely Moyal, Andres Malinao and Kevin Cascell.\nCaptain Beefheart, Wire, The Boredoms, Sun City Girls, Pavement and Sonic Youth have all been identified as influences, and during the course of the band's history Trumans Water has produced experimental indie rock, often with a substantial element of improvisation. Kevin Branstetter described the band's approach in 1993: \"The spirit of the thing is what we want to capture, mess things up, like totally skewing everything, destroying everything and still making it totally listenable\" and their recording process: \"We record everything live, all play at the same time\".\nThe disc jockey John Peel effectively shot the band to indie stardom in the UK when he played their first LP, Of Thick Tum, uninterrupted and in its entirety during an edition of his BBC Radio One show. The band subsequently recorded three sessions for Peel's show.\nThe Branstetter brothers relocated to Portland, Oregon in 1994 without Galloway and are the only original members still active in the band. Galloway assumed the Glen Galaxy name to record as Soul-Junk, an experimental Christian rock band, before returning to Trumans Water in 1998. Kevin Branstetter subsequently moved to France in 1995. Being on different continents for the last several years has curbed their musical output but by no means stopped it; they have released six albums despite the geographical separation.\nTrumans Water has recently added the bass guitar player Mike Coumatos after more than ten years touring and recording as a three piece (two guitars and drums). A new drummer, John Schier, has been added as well.\nTrumans Water has been cited as an influence by several bands including The Cribs.\nIn 2011, Kevin Branstetter moved to France. Worlds Dirtiest Sport is his side project doing solo (or with guests) guitar/bass guitar/loops/noise songs. The project was started as an outlet when one or more other Trumans was unavailable.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nOf Thick Tum (1992, Homestead Records)\nSpasm Smash XXXOXOX Ox & Ass (1993, Homestead Records)\nGodspeed the Punchline (1994, Homestead Records)\nGodspeed the Static (1994, Drunken Fish)\nGodspeed the Hemorrhage (1994, Homestead Records)\nGodspeed the Vortex (1994, Way Out Sound)\nMilktrain to Paydirt (1995, Homestead Records)\nThe Peel Sessions (1995, Strange Fruit)\nAction Ornaments (1996, Runt)\nApistogramma (1997, Justice My Eye / Elevated Loin)\nFragments of a Lucky Break (1998, Emperor Jones)\nTrumans Water (2001, Emperor Jones)\nYou are in the Line of Fire and they are Shooting at You (2003, Homesleep Records)\nThe Singles 1992-1997 (2003, No Sides)\nRosolina Mar meets Trumans Water (2007, Robotradiorecords - split with Rosolina Mar)\nO Zeta Zunis (August 24, 2010, Asthmatic Kitty Records)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nOur Scars Like Badges (7-inch EP, 1992, Homestead Records)\nLaugh Light's Lit (7-inch EP, 1992, Drunken Fish)\nJubileeeee (7-inch EP, 1992, Way Out Sound)\n\"Hey Fish\" (7-inch, 1993, Drunken Fish)\n10 x My Age (CD EP/10\", 1993, Elemental Records)\nHave You Got It Yet?

    "text": "Grouptherapy (stylized as grouptherapy.) is an American hip hop collective from Los Angeles, founded in 2019 by rappers and singers Jadagrace, TJOnline, Coy Stewart, and Rhea. Rhea and TJOnline departed from the group in 2020 and 2024, respectively. The group's debut studio album, I Was Mature For My Age, But I Was Still A Child, was released on June 27, 2023 after a series of EPs and a mixtape.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2019-2022: Founding and early projects ===\nGrouptherapy's members originally met due to their shared background as child entertainers. Prior to their incorporation as a group, the four had been making music together for three years. Before making their debut as a group, Swim had released a TJOnline-produced mixtape, Everyone's Got One. The group's debut release, \"Yikes\" by Koi featuring TJW (at the time of release, TJOnline and Swim were known as TJW and Koi, respectively), was released on October 22, 2019. This began a series of singles released by the group's individual members, culminating in the release of \"Powerball\" by TJW. These singles were compiled into an EP titled This Is Not The Album, released on April 1, 2020.\nOn July 10, the single \"Raise It Up!\", the first single from the group's debut mixtape, There Goes The Neighborhood, was released. Unlike previous releases, \"Raise It Up!\" was credited to the group as a whole, rather than to a specific member. Two more singles, \"Watercolor\" and \"Blackout\", were released before There Goes The Neighborhood came out on October 30, 2020. By the time There Goes The Neighborhood was released, Rhea had departed from the group. On November 19, a music video for \"Wish U Were Here\", was released.\nOn April 9, 2022, Grouptherapy's second EP, Truth Be Told, was released. The EP was preceded by the singles \"Risky\" and \"Disco Pantz\", a collaboration with Rejjie Snow and Tinashe.\n\n\n=== 2023-present: I Was Mature For My Age, But I Was Still A Child and TJOnline's departure ===\nOn April 25, 2023, the group released \"Funkfest\", the lead single from their debut studio album, I Was Mature For My Age, But I Was Still A Child. \"Funkfest\" was followed by \"Nasty\" and \"Peak\" on June 6 and June 15, respectively. I Was Mature For My Age, But I Was Still A Child was released on June 27th.\nOn March 8, 2024, the group released The Addendum - I Was Mature For My Age, But I Was Still A Child, a deluxe edition of their debut album. On March 20, TJOnline announced his departure from Grouptherapy, with Swim and Jadagrace to continue as a duo.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nSwim - vocals (2019-present) (known as Koi, 2019-2020)\nJadagrace - vocals (2019-present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nTJOnline - vocals, production (2019-2024) (known as TJW, 2019-2020)\nRhea - vocals (2019-2020)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n== References =="

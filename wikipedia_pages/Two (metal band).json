    "text": "Two was an English-American industrial metal band, formed by former Judas Priest lead singer Rob Halford after the break-up of his previous band Fight.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHalford and guitarist John 5 formed the band in 1996 under the name Gimp and would record an album's worth of demos. While attending Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Halford met Trent Reznor and presented him a copy of the material, which in return, Reznor stepped in as producer and released it under his Nothing Records label. Upon discovering that another band was using the Gimp name, the group was redubbed 2wo. In March 1998, the album Voyeurs was released. It sold poorly and was not well received. After a headlining tour, 2wo disbanded and John 5 would join Marilyn Manson. Halford initially began demos for a follow-up album, but eventually called the band quits and would use the material for his next band Halford.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Videography ==\nHalford hired porn director Chi Chi Larue to direct the video for the first single, \"I Am a Pig\". This video featured grainy S&M scenes of the band and various porn stars, including a few brief glimpses of Janine Lindemulder, in a sex dungeon. It also incorporates some of the album's artwork into the concept. It was not widely shown because of its content, but was not banned.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNY Rock interview with Rob Halford\nTwo at AllMusic"

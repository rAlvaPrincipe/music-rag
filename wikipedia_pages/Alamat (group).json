    "text": "Alamat (Baybayin: ᜀᜎᜋᜆ᜔) (stylized in all caps) is a Filipino boy band formed in 2020 by Viva Artists Agency and Ninuno Media. The group consists of six members: Taneo, Mo, Jao, Tomás, R-Ji and Alas. The members hail from different regions of the Philippines and sing in their own respective languages.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed through Pwede: The National Boyband Search, the group distinguishes itself as a multilingual and multiethnic boy band that sings in seven Philippine languages: Tagalog, Ilocano, Kapampangan, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Bikolano, and Waray-Waray. After training for nine months, the group debuted on February 14, 2021, with their first single, \"Kbye\". \n\nOriginally a nine-piece ensemble, Kin departed the group in late March 2021 for personal reasons, followed by Valfer and Gami, who also left in late March 2022. Alamat holds the distinction of being the second P-pop group to make it on Billboard's Next Big Sound chart, debuting at number two. They were also regarded as the fastest-rising Filipino act on this chart.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nAlamat's music blends indigenous instruments such as kudyapi and kulintang with modern sounds. Their choreography is also influenced by traditional dances, such as the Maranao dance singkil that inspired \"Maharani\".\nThe group's outfits typically blend modern fashion with traditional elements from the many cultures of the Philippines.\nThe members have written and produced many of their songs, including their debut single \"Kbye\". Mo has said that the song was the result of a \"random and unplanned\" jam session.\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nThe music video for the Alamat song \"ABKD\" condemned colorism and discrimination against the Aeta people, one of the Philippines' Indigenous groups. The video starred the young Aeta actress Shella Mae Romualdo and featured Aeta dancers. In 2024, Alamat performed at the University of the Philippines' annual advocacy-focused fair. They performed on Tuesday and Saturday during the week-long fair, with advocacies on those days focusing on free education and Indigenous rights respectively.\nJao has stated that Alamat aims to promote the Philippines' cultural diversity and multilingualism. They have also expressed support for the LGBTQ community.\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\nIn October 2024, all of the Alamat members walked the runway at BYS Fashion Week 2024. They modeled upcycled pieces by Russell Villafuerte. They also modeled Charlotte Folk's new streetwear offerings alongside Karina Bautista.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nTomás - main vocalist, lead dancer & center\nR-Ji - lead vocalist\nTaneo - leader, main dancer, sub-vocalist & sub-rapper\nAlas - main rapper\nMo - main vocalist & lead rapper\nJao - main dancer, sub-vocalist, & main rapper\n\n\n=== Former ===\nAmbri (2020)\nKin (2021)\nValfer (2021–2022)\nGami (2021–2022)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n=== Television shows ===\n\n\n== Concerts ==\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\n\n\n== References =="

Miyata said of his relationship with Tamamori, \"Originally, we were not in a prominent position at all, but at some point, only Tamamori became successful and started taking the center position. I was sometimes frustrated with myself, but I was never strangely jealous of Tamamori's success.  I love him and think he is a genius at entertaining people. We have been together since we were teens, and even now that we are adults, we are still friends who joke around like kids. I think we will continue to work together for a long time to come.\"\n\n\n==== Ren Nagase ====\nTamamori has been close with his junior, Ren Nagase of King & Prince, since they co-starred in TV series The Knife and the Sword, and they have dined together privately, collaborated on Instagram.

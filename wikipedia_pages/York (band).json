    "text": "York is a German electronic music duo, founded in 1997 by musicians and brothers Torsten and Jörg Stenzel. Producing ambient, downtempo, chillout, house and trance, their productions are known for catchy guitar hooks, atmospheric soundscapes and delicate dance textures.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTorsten Stenzel began his musical career early in his childhood, learning the piano from the age of five when he began his classical training. In the early 1990s his musical orientation changed, and he discovered the growing techno/house movement. He built his own recording studio. Torsten Stenzel is credited for several gold and platinum awards, an 'Echo' nomination and over three million record sales.\nJörg Stenzel has, since the age of eleven, been interested in stringed instruments, the guitar in particular. The two brothers combined their talents in 1997 and project York was born.\nYork has released four successful UK singles. Their first single, \"The Awakening\", reached #11 in the UK Singles Chart in October 1999. Their second single, \"On the Beach\" (which sampled Chris Rea's song, \"On the Beach\") was their biggest hit, the 'CRW edit' helped the single to reach #4 in the UK chart in June 2000, and it sold over 200,000 copies. The next chart entry \"Farewell To The Moon\" reached #37 in November 2000. Their final UK hit single to date was \"The Fields of Love\" which featured ATB. It reached #16 in January 2001.\nYork joined the label Offshore Music (based in Switzerland) in 2004, with their club hit singles \"Iceflowers\" (playlisted by Judge Jules) and \"Mercury Rising\". The same year their album Peace was released by EMI Music Switzerland. In November 2010, York left the Offshore Record Label.\nAs of late 2011, York was signed to the major Dutch dance record label Armada Music. A new album, Islanders was released 28 September 2012, with three tracks released as singles: \"Wanna Be Known\", \"Touched by God\" and \"Salida del Sol\". The track \"Islanders\" is a collaboration with British multi-instrumentalist and composer Mike Oldfield.\nIn February 2013, a new collaboration with Mike Oldfield was released; the album Tubular Beats is an album with the best of Mike Oldfield's tracks, remixed by York.\nThe new album titled Traveler was released on July 8, 2016.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nExperience (2001)\nPeace (2004)\nIslanders (2012)\nTubular Beats (2013)\nTraveller (2016)\n\"Indigo\" (2022)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"The Awakening\" (1998)\n\"Jastamba\" (feat.

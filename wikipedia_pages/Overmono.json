    "text": "Overmono is a Welsh electronic music duo consisting of brothers Tom and Ed Russell.\n\n\n== History ==\nPrior to the formation of Overmono, Tom and Ed Russell both explored solo careers. Under the name 'Truss', Tom produced hard techno; as 'Tessela', Ed produced drum and bass and rave-inspired tracks including 2013's \"Hackney Parrot\". The brothers also performed together for a brief time in 2012 under the name 'TR/ER'. In 2015, the duo began producing music together, with their first EP, Arla, being released on XL Recordings in 2016.\nAlongside XL, the duo released music on their own label, Poly Kicks, founded by Ed in 2013. The label has also released music from Joy Orbison and Special Request, as well as the pair's remix of For Those I Love's \"I Have A Love,\" released in 2020.\nIn 2021, the duo won 'UK's Best Live Act' at DJ Mag's Best of British award.\nOvermono has frequently collaborated with Joy Orbison. Their first release as a trio was with 2019's \"Bromley\" / \"Still Moving\", released on XL Recordings under the portmanteau 'Joy Overmono'. Their second release was in 2022 with \"Blind Date\", featuring a vocal sample from artist ABRA.\nIn April 2023, Overmono performed at the 22nd Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The following month, their debut studio album, Good Lies, was released on 12 May 2023 through XL Recordings.

    "text": "The Goner was a psychedelic folk rock band from Sweden. Starting out as a solo project of Daniel Westerlund in 2008, the lineup quickly expanded and over time developed into a six piece live band; playing an eclectic range of instruments including banjo, violin and synths.\nThe Goner debuted in 2008 with a series of EPs dubbed the H-Trilogy on Daniel Westerlund's own CD-R label Svarta Marknaden: Halartrallar, Hind Hand and Haven.\nThese limited releases garnered some interest and collectively secured the #1 spot on It's a Trap! Scandinavian Music Journal's top album list of 2008.\nThe following year, Hind Hand and Haven were reissued as the double album HH on US-based label Deep Water Acres.\nFeaturing The Goner in full band mode, the release of Behold A New Traveler in 2010 drew further attention including a favorable review by Julian Cope, author of Krautrocksampler.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Releases ===\nH-Trilogy\nHalartrallar (Svarta Marknaden, 2008)\nHind Hand (Svarta Marknaden, 2008)\nHaven (Svarta Marknaden, 2008)\nHH, reissue of Hind Hand and Haven (Deep Water Acres, 2009)\nBehold A New Traveler (Deep Water Acres, 2010)\nBitemarks EP (Sideways Through Sound, Dying For Bad Music, 2010)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nDet Grymma Sv√§rdet #5, magazine with 10-inch vinyl (Lystring, 2010)  \"Backwards Crawl Relay\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Goner Official Site\nThe Goner on Facebook\nThe Goner at Dying For Bad Music\nThe Goner at Deep Water Acres\nEarly interview at Deep Water Acres\nThe Goner at Svarta Marknaden\nThe Goner at It's a Trap!

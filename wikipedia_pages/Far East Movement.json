    "text": "Far East Movement (abbreviated FM) is an American hip hop and electronic music group based in Los Angeles, composed of Kev Nish, Prohgress, J-Splif, Jon Street, Ray Ro, DJ Virman, and Jerm Beats. They signed with Martin Kierszenbaum's Cherrytree Records, an imprint of Interscope Records to release their 2010 single, \"Like a G6\" (featuring The Cataracs and Dev) which peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, making them the first Asian American group to reach number one on the chart. Their follow up single, \"Rocketeer\" (featuring Ryan Tedder), peaked at number seven and led their third album and major label debut, Free Wired (2010). It performed moderately on the Billboard 200, while their fourth album, Dirty Bass (2012) saw a steep commercial decline, although its lead single, \"Live My Life\" (featuring Justin Bieber) reached number 24 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nThe group's fifth album, Identity (2016) focused on bridging Eastern artists with the group's Western dance music roots. Released independently, the album received positive reviews and spawned the single \"Freal Luv\" (with Marshmello featuring Tinashe and Chanyeol). Far East Movement has also branched out with a number of collaborations on labels Ministry of Sound, Dim Mak Records, and Ultra Records.\nIn 2016, Far East Movement's company, Transparent Arts (TA), moved into artist management. TA manages seven artists of various genres, including Korean-American K-pop artist Tiffany Young, rappers Dumbfoundead and Year of the Ox, DJ producers Yultron, Autolaser, and singer Satica. The artists have garnered millions of social media plays, sold out national tours, and have released tracks through labels Owsla, Spinnin', Armada, and Universal. They launched a joint label, BredNButter, with YouTube channel Trap City. BredNButter's releases have amassed millions of plays in total in a little over a year of existence. They also founded Identity Festival, a festival celebrating Asian American Heritage with the City of Los Angeles on the steps of City Hall which gathered over 10,000 attendees in 2018 with headliners Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park and K-pop singer Jay Park.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\n\n\n=== 2003–2007: Folk Music ===\nThe three original members of Far East Movement, Kevin Nishimura (Kev Nish), James Roh (Prohgress), and Jae Choung (J-Splif), grew up in the Downtown Los Angeles area. They were close companions in high school and shared a passion for music together. The trio promoted their music online and began performing at local clubs and events in Los Angeles; soon, they began their musical career with the name \"Emcees Anonymous\" by 2001. However, they later changed it to Far East Movement or FM, originating from a song that they produced with the same name. In 2003, they organised an event called \"Movementality\" in Koreatown, Los Angeles, featuring ten different performances with all the proceeds sent to a local youth drug rehabilitation center.\nIn 2005, Far East Movement released a mixtape called Audio-Bio, which was one of their first CDs and contained many of their earliest songs and many songs not available anywhere else. Their first album, titled Folk Music, was released in early 2006. The single \"Round Round\" was featured in the film, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, appearing both on the self-titled soundtrack and video game. This critical breakout was the catalyst that cemented their decision to pursue music as a full-time career. Their songs \"Get Offa Me\" and \"Make Ya Self\" were featured in The Fast and the Furious video game. They proceeded to perform on two world tours (including USA, South America, Canada, and Asia), and they signed distribution deals in Japan and Korea with Avex Network and JF Productions for their album.\nIn 2007, they were featured in the Sundance Film Festival film called Finishing the Game, making the song \"Satisfaction\" for the film. They also released the single \"You've Got A Friend\" featuring Lil Rob and Baby Bash, which became their first song on major national radio.\n\n\n=== 2008–2009: DJ Virman and Animal ===\n\nLA's radio station Power 106 DJ, DJ Virman, came to the group as their official DJ. They released another single titled \"Lowridin\" that received heavy airplay in 2009. Soon after, they planned on showcasing a second album, releasing Animal later on in the same year. Animal featured three hit singles that frequently won national radio play: \"You’ve Got A Friend\", \"Lowridin\", and the successful \"Girls On The Dance Floor\". \"Girls on the Dance Floor\" reached 27 on the Billboard chart for the Latin Rhythm Airplay, which marked their debut on the Billboard's charts.\nThere were several collaborations on the Animal album, including The Stereotypes, Lil Rob, Baby Bash, Wiz Khalifa, Bionik, 24/8, IZ, DB Tonik,Jah Free, and Bruno Mars, that made his first appearance on an official track for the first time on the track \"3D\". Their songs from the Animal album were featured in major film and television on multiple occasions. FM's single \"Girls on the Dance Floor\" has been played on MTV's America's Best Dance Crew on the Season 4 Finale during a performance with Artistry In Motion, Vogue Evolution and We Are Heroes. It was also featured on Get Him to the Greek, FOX's So You Think You Can Dance and on the 7th episode of CSI: Miami Season 8. In addition, \"Dance Like Michael Jackson\" was aired on ABC Family's Lincoln Heights on November 10, 2009 and on the Gossip Girl episode, \"Dan de Fleurette\". \"I Party\" was highlighted on FOX's TV series Lie To Me and \"Fetish\" was on Spike TV's Guy's Choice Awards 2009. \"Girls on the Dance Floor\" has attained over 5 million hits on Myspace while attracting over 8 million views on YouTube.\nStreetwear company Orisue teamed up with Far East Movement and helped shoot a music video for \"Lowridin\". In May 2009, Far East Movement joined the Korean hip hop group Epik High on their \"Map the Soul\" tour throughout the U.S. Then they held their first headlining concert at the Roxy Theater in Hollywood by July 2009, which resulted in a sold-out show. Together with Wong Fu Productions, FM has established another three sold-out \"International Secret Agents\" concerts titled as \"ISA\", hosted in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York in order to promote Asian American artists in the media with performances by Quest Crew, Poreotics, Jay Park, and others.\nFM's mixtape Party Animal was released on the first date of LMFAO's Party Rock Tour. Their two singles, \"Girls on the Dance Floor\" and \"2 is Better w/ Ya Boy\", garnered successful radio airplay. They later announced that they were working on a new album with Grammy nominated producers, The Stereotypes, who had produced their hit track, \"Girls on the Dance Floor\".\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: Cherrytree/Interscope Records and Free Wired ===\n\nIn February 2010, Far East Movement signed a major record deal with Cherrytree Records, a subsidiary of Interscope Records.

    "text": "The Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra (SJMO) is the national jazz orchestra of the United States. It is based at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., where it is the orchestra-in-residence. The SJMO was founded in 1990 with the dual mission of  performing and preserving American jazz masterworks and raising public awareness and understanding of the genre.\n\n\n== History ==\nAn Act of Congress established the orchestra in 1990 with an appropriation to the Smithsonian Institution of $242,000. In 1991 Gunther Schuller and David Baker became the original artistic and musical directors of the orchestra, which began performing in 1991. Five years later Baker became its sole artistic and musical director. \nThe inaugural season, jointly conducted by Schuller and Baker, consisted of six weekends of free concerts for which the conductors collected or commissioned transcriptions of the original arrangements of the works to be presented and provided the orchestra's members with tapes of the original performances. \n\nSince 1991 the SJMO has performed in nine foreign countries and twenty-six U.S. states, in addition to numerous free concerts in Washington, D.C. Appearances outside their base at the National Museum of American History have included a performance at the White House in 1993 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Newport Jazz Festival; the Cultural Olympiad at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia; and a 1999 tour of the United States to present concerts in tribute to the 100th anniversary of Duke Ellington's birth that included a concert performance at the Monterey Jazz Festival featuring Ellington's Suite Thursday, which was commissioned for the festival. Among the orchestra's notable performances under Baker's leadership outside the United States was a concert in Egypt in 2008, when it played at the Cairo Opera House, the Alexandra Opera House, and at the Pyramids.\nIn 2012, at the age of 80, Baker concluded his tenure as the SJMO's artistic director, and was named maestro emeritus in December 2012. The occasion was marked by a special concert consisting entirely of Baker's compositions. Charlie Young, a jazz saxophonist and educator at Howard University, became artistic director after Baker's retirement.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAs of 2015, the orchestra's principal members were:\nArtistic and Musical Director\n\nCharlie Young\nExecutive Producer\n\nKen Kimery\nReeds\n\nSteve Williams\nBill Mulligan\nScott Silbert\nLuis Hernandez\nLeigh Pilzer\nTrumpets\n\nLiesl Whitaker\nTom Williams\nKenny Rittenhouse\nTrombones\n\nJennifer Krupa\nMatt Niess\nBill Holmes\nJeff Cortazzo\nPiano\n\nTony Nalker\nBass\n\nJames King\nAmy Shook\nDrums\n\nKen Kimery\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe orchestra's recordings include:\n\nBernstein Reimagined\nTribute to a Generation: A Salute to the Big Bands\nTri-C Jazzfest 2001\nPiano Grand!

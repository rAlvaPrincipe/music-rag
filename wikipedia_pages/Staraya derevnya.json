    "text": "Staraya derevnya (Russian: Старая деревня, \"Old village\") is an experimental psychedelic band that has been active since 1994. It is named after the historic district of Saint Petersburg. The group's music style is self-defined as \"krautfolk\" and is characterised by free-form jams, hypnotic rhythmic patterns and an eclectic mix of instruments. Their live performances are described as played in near-total darkness in order to shift audience attention to projected animated paintings, improvised together with the music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nBoulder blues (2022), Ramble records\nInwards opened the floor.

On December 13, they will issue the \"SKZhop Hiptape\" special album Hop on December 13. The album combines hip-hop influences, introducing music under the 'SKZhop' genre, a term blending the group's initials, \"SKZ\", and \"hip hop\". Also in 2024, Stray Kids performed \"Slash,\" which is included on the soundtrack album for the American superhero film Deadpool & Wolverine (2024); and \"Come Play\" with Young Miko and Tom Morello for the soundtrack to the second season of the television series Arcane.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Musical style ===\n\nStray Kids' music is inspired by hip-hop, dubstep, heavy metal, electroclash and dance-pop, and has been described as \"dark and experimental.\" After the release of the album Go Live, the public and some entertainment media outlets began calling Stray Kids the pioneers of \"mala taste music\" (Korean: 마라맛 음악; RR: Maramat eumak), a name they adopted from the hot, spicy mala seasoning, and became a rising music trend among K-Pop boy groups. The band's songs initially received criticism for being too \"noisy\"; with the album Noeasy, they embraced the criticism, saying the term was \"something that [they] could use as [their] own weapon\". During the showcase for Rock-Star, the band's members said they plan to retain their tenacious music with principles (Korean: 줏대; RR: jutdae; lit. strong spine). Stray Kids said they want their music to be recognized as a new genre, stating in a 2023 interview during the Next Generation Leaders with Time: \"The goal is to continuously pioneer new [musical] subjects and to have our music be recognized as a 'Stray Kids' genre\".\nExperimental music has been Stray Kids' identity since the beginning of their career, combining genres throughout their discography. Their debut song \"District 9\" is a hybrid genre that combines hip-hop, rock and EDM with frenetic bass, sirens, EDM breaks, aggressive raps and hip-hop dance moves. They attempted a new sound with \"Side Effects\", a propulsive, EDM-pop hybrid song that was inspired by psytrance. \"God's Menu\" is said to have a new genre called \"mala taste\", which is defined as hot, strong and spicy songs. In \"Thunderous\", they used contemporary synths and drops to blend traditional Korean instruments such as the kwaenggwari (꽹과리; a small, flat, brass gong) and traditional Korean drums. \"Maniac\" is a Middle Eastern-influenced, \"powerful\" trap, electropop song with a bass-synth drop, bird-chirping and drill sounds. \"Case 143\" is a pop song that incorporates a descending chromatic scale, changes in key signature, intense rap verses and a flexible rhythm. \"S-Class\" is a hip hop track with elements of boom bap, old school and pop. It was mixed between booming rap, thrumming bass, sultry electro, 1990s hip-hop, sparkling pop and grimy club. \"Lalalala\" is a rock-leaning phonk music with harsh rap tone along the song except for the bridge part that almost orchestral-like.\n\n\n=== Songwriting and lyrical themes ===\n\nStray Kids is a \"self-producing\" idol group whose members have almost always been involved in songwriting and composing, and have sometimes assisted in arranging, even before the official debut. The band's in-house production team, which is called 3Racha, consists of the members Bang Chan, Changbin, and Han, who have been releasing self-produced tracks on SoundCloud since 2017 and are largely responsible for crafting Stray Kids' music, with all members integral to the process. All of the members have YouTube projects like SKZ-Record and SKZ-Player, where each of them produce, choreograph, or cover songs; Two Kids Song, where the members were paired to write, produce and record an original song with the same beat sample; and SKZ Song Camp: Howl in Harmony, where the members were divided into three teams and produced their own songs.\nThe main lyrical theme of Stray Kids' songs is the process and hardship of searching for their identity, especially in their early EP albums I Am ... series and Clé series. In \"District 9\", the lyrics implied the band members were frustrated by people questioning their identity, which they acknowledge they had not yet found. In \"My Pace\", the lyrics imply comparison with others can cause nervousness or anxiety, but each person has their own pace. The lyrics of \"I Am You\" are about the band thanking their audience for supporting the band, even when they did not know themselves. \"Miroh\" implies Stray Kids' strength, energy and aspiration to enter a rough \"maze\" (Korean: 미로; RR: Miro) to achieve their dreams. In \"Side Effects\", the members are rebelling because they wanted to do what they chose to do, even thought that choice may result in side effects. The lyrics imply it is okay to \"shout 'my head hurts' \" in difficult situations but not give up because the side effects are never permanent. The lyrics of \"Levanter\" (Korean: 바람; RR: baram; lit. wind) imply the keys they searched for were within them and that Stray Kids must be themselves to continue their journey following the wind.\nAfter the completion of I Am ... and Clé series, Stray Kids found their own identity and the band's lyrical themes shifted. They introduced \"God's Menu\" as their unique sound; the song uses culinary metaphors like \"Welcome, it's easy to choose what you want in our kitchen. Anything on the menu will satisfy all your five senses\", \"This is our tang, tang, tang, tang\" (Korean: 탕; RR: tang; lit. soup), and \"You ask \"What's our secret ingredient?\". But we don't even use one\". Stray Kids received some criticism because their sound was considered too \"noisy\" by some, yet they \"embrace[ed their] noisiness\" in the lyrics of \"Thunderous\". In \"Maniac\", the band encouraged their audience to embrace their own \"quirkness\". \"S-Class\" is the continuation of the previous album Oddinary, in which they shout: \"The odd one, that's me!\". In \"S-Class\" they invite listeners to do the same in the lyrics: \"Be the one to shine instead of chasing after what's shiny\". \"Lalalala\" celebrates the band members' lives and career, pushing through pain to find joy and release through music.\nThe band's B-sides often talk about self-reflection. On their debut album, the songs \"Mirror\" and \"3rd Eye\" discuss the difficulties of finding one's true self; in the song \"Awaken\", they stress the importance of fighting one's way out of a shell. Some Stray Kids songs challenge new themes that are different from their other releases, like \"Case 143\" from Maxident, which is their first release that is explicitly about romantic love.\nStray Kids are known for using wordplay in lyrics and song titles. The title of the album Go Live combines the English word go with the Korean word hanja (life) (Korean: GO生; RR: go-saeng) but the pronunciation gosaeng (Korean: 고생) can also mean \"hardship\" in Korean. The album's song \"God's Menu\" also contains wordplay from the hanja word \"god\" and the hangul word \"menu\" (Korean: 神메뉴; RR: sinmenyu; lit. God's Menu) but the pronunciation \"sin-menu\" (신메뉴) can also mean \"new menu\" in Korean. In Noeasy, the album's title combines \"no\" and \"easy\" to mean \"not easy\", but its pronunciation sounds like \"noisy\". Its track \"Thunderous\" has a different Korean title \"소리꾼\" (Korean: 소리꾼; RR: sorikkun; lit. singers of pansori) which combines the word \"소리\" (Korean: 소리; RR: sori; lit. sound) and \"꾼\" (Korean: 꾼; RR: kkun; lit. suffix for a \"doer\"), which can also mean a person who \"does sound very well\". The Korean title of the song \"Lalalala\" (Korean: 락; Hanja: 樂; RR: rak; lit. pleasure) is also a wordplay with \"rock\", expressing the meaning of \"although you will feel any emotions in life, you hope the last emotion you choose will be pleasure\".\n\n\n=== Stage, performance and concept aesthetics ===\nStray Kids has been acknowledged for the band's stage and performance through multiple daesang (grand prize) awards in this category, such as Performance of the Year award at 2021 Asia Artist Awards (AAA), Stage of the Year award at 2023 AAA, and the Best Performance awards at 2023 and 2024 Hanteo Music Awards. They also earned the title \"K-Performance Leaders\" (Korean: K-퍼포먼스 대장주; RR: Keipeopomeonseu daejangju). Industry figures and the media have praised the band's stage performances during year-end award shows.\nStray Kids earned the title \"Concept Matjib\" (Korean: 콘셉트 맛집; RR: konsepteu matjib; lit. place/person with great concept) for their innovative concept in each release. The band's concepts are shown in the choreography, music videos, stage outfits, and music style; the group's stylist, whose pseudonym on Instagram is Doooho, received praise for the styling of the band's outfits. The band's choreography for \"God';s Menu\" incorporates mixing, frying, seasoning, and chopping to match the song's culinary concept. Door-knocking choreography is used for \"Back Door\". In the music video for \"Thunderous\", the band members danced in dokkaebi styles with pungmul folks and white lions in front of hanok to incorporate Korean folklore. For \"Maniac\", they referenced Frankenstein's monster in the lyrics, choreography, and concept photographs.\nStray Kids incorporate choreography and stage properties to complete their concept aesthetics, especially for year-end shows and competition. During the 35th Golden Disc Awards, Stray Kids performed \"God's Menu\" with elegant dance moves and a huge fan, and received a best performance award for the first time. During the 2020 SBS Gayo Daejeon performance, they performed a nanta show to emphasize the cooking theme of \"God's Menu\". During 2021 SBS Gayo Daejeon, they performed \"Winter Falls\" and \"Thunderous\" (Christmas version) with point choreography using canes, a performance that staged scenes from the popular Netflix drama Squid Game, and Felix's tap dance.\n\nThe group competed in and won the 2021 competition show Kingdom: Legendary War, where they performed for five rounds, including the introduction stage. For the introduction stage, the band performed \"Miroh\" within a 100-seconds time limit with a neon-style LED flashlight, karambit, wolf tattoos on the back of their hands, and acrobatic choreography that included backflips, a climbing human pyramid and a wolf to express the exploration of a mountain and a river. In Round One, they performed \"Jasin\" (Korean: 스스로 '자', 귀신 '신'; Hanja: 自神; lit. self 'ja', ghost 'sin') which is a mashup of their songs \"God's Menu\" and \"Side Effects\", implying the theme \"We chose to become evil to live\" with each member's solo performance of struggling to overcome oppression through acrobatics. On the broadcast day of this episode, experts praised Stray Kids' first competition stage, saying: \"A stage that well expresses the fight with the inner self through the harmony of black and white\" and \"A group with powerful spirit as its strength\", and praised the band's outstanding stage abilities. For Round Two, they exchanged songs with BtoB and performed an arrangement of \"I'll be Your Man\", showing their vocal skills in slightly different lyrics to fit the theme of \"sacrificing ourselves to demons to rescue a beloved one\". The members' performances included the destruction a mythical-temple-like set, and used objects such as flower bouquet, heart, handkerchiefs and knives.\nRound Three consist of 2 parts; in the first part, the band worked with BtoB and Ateez to perform rap, dance, vocals, and in the second part, they performed a song with no limitation. In Round Three Part One, 3Racha (Bang Chan, Changbin, and Han) performed \"Colours\" (물감놀이; Mulgamnori; lit. Paint Play) with Minhyuk and Hongjoong for the rap category with witty lyrics that imply the theme \"each different colors become one through music\", and a playful splash of colors on stage.

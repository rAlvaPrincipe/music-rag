Ces Cru released their debut album Capture Enemy Soldiers in 2004. They went on to release Cesphiles, Vol. 1 Codename:irongiant (2008) and The Playground (2009).

The most recent release from Ces Cru is their sixth studio album Catastrophic Event Specialists, released in February 2017. In 2021, both artists have since departed from the label.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe group went through a number of different group members before becoming the trio of Ubiquitous, Godemis and Sorceress in the early 2000s. In 2004, the group released its debut album, Capture Enemy Soldiers. But while promoting the project, Sorceress wanted to fire the groupâ€™s then-manager. Ubiquitous and Godemis disagreed, and Sorceress departed the group. They returned as a duo in 2009 with The Playground, an album they hand delivered to Strange Music label boss Tech N9ne when he witnessed the group opening for Devin the Dude at a Kansas City show. Tech signed them to Strange Music in January 2012, and eight months later they released their Strange Music debut, the 13 EP on August 28, 2012. On March 26, 2013, the duo released their fourth album Constant Energy Struggles. The album debuted at number 98 on the Billboard 200. On August 5, 2014, they released their fifth album Codename: Ego Stripper which debuted at number 40 on the Billboard 200.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "God Is an Astronaut are an Irish post-rock band from County Wicklow, formed in 2002 by Niels and Torsten Kinsella. Their style employs elements of electronic music, krautrock, and space rock, reminiscent of Tangerine Dream. They have released twelve studio albums to date.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe band was formed in 2002 by twin brothers Niels and Torsten Kinsella, who took the inspiration for its name from a quote in the movie Nightbreed. God Is an Astronaut's debut album, The End of the Beginning, was released in 2002 on the Revive Records label, which is independently owned by the band. The album was intended to be a farewell to the industry. Two music videos, for \"The End of the Beginning\" and \"From Dust to the Beyond\", both produced by the band, received airplay on MTV UK and other MTV Europe networks.\nGIAA consider each of their albums to be a sonic \"photograph or snapshot of who we are in that moment of time\". In mid-2006, a licensing deal with U.K. label Rocket Girl saw both an EP, called A Moment of Stillness, and their second album, All Is Violent, All Is Bright, being re-released.\nThe band's third album, Far from Refuge, was released in April 2007 on Revive Records and as a download via their website. Their fourth, the self-titled God Is an Astronaut, came out on 7 November 2008. On 12 February 2010, a single was released on the band's website, titled \"In the Distance Fading\", the second song from their fifth album, called Age of the Fifth Sun, released on 17 May 2010. That year, the band became a quartet, with keyboardist/guitarist Jamie Dean joining.\nGod Is an Astronaut performed at the Eurosonic Festival in 2012, when Ireland was the \"Spotlight Country\". \nThe band's sixth full-length album, Origins, was released in 2013. They then went on tour, performing in places such as China, Russia, Brazil, and Europe.\nIn June 2015, the band's seventh full-length album, Helios | Erebus, was released. \nIn 2018, GIAA published Epitaph, their eighth full-length studio album.\nIn February 2021, the band released Ghost Tapes#10 on Napalm Records.\nIn June 2024, GIAA announced their eleventh album, Embers, and released the first single, \"Falling Leaves\". The album came out on 6 September.\n\n\n== 2008 US tour incident ==\nIn early 2008, GIAA embarked on their first tour of the United States. On the day they were set to return home, $20,000 worth of equipment was stolen from their van in New Jersey. Their equipment was not insured, and a tour that had reportedly already cost them $20,000 to organize suddenly doubled in cost.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent\n\nTorsten Kinsella – vocals, guitars, keyboards (2002–present)\nNiels Kinsella – bass, guitars(2002–present)\nLloyd Hanney – drums (2003–present)\nPast\n\nGazz Carr – keyboards, synthesizer, guitar (2012–13, 2019)\nRobert Murphy – keyboards, synthesizer, guitar (touring, 2017–2019)\nJamie Dean – keyboards, guitar (2010–2017, 2020–2022)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nThe End of the Beginning (2002)\nAll Is Violent, All Is Bright (2005)\nA Moment of Stillness (2006)\nFar from Refuge (2007)\nGod Is an Astronaut (2008)\nAge of the Fifth Sun (2010)\nOrigins (2013)\nHelios | Erebus (2015)\nEpitaph (2018)\nGhost Tapes #10 (2021)\nSomnia (2022)\nEmbers (2024)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nGod Is an Astronaut at AllMusic"

    "text": "Testube is an American solo electronic music project, founded in 1994 by Jeff Danos (born May 9, 1976).  His music spans multiple subgenres of electronic music, including Industrial, Glitch, Experimental, IDM, Electroclash, Darkwave, Ambient, Synthpop and EBM.\n\n\n== History ==\nTestube began in 1994 as a tribal-influenced experimental electronic side-project of the early 1990s Industrial music group Wrack Process. The earliest recordings occurred in 1994–1995 and featured musical contributions from Jeff Danos and Bryan Elsloo. From these early recordings, the two musicians released a self-titled Testube cassette in March 1996 on UEF Records. Following the dissolution of Wrack Process later that year, co-founder Jeff Danos briefly produced solo material under the monikers \"Danos\" and \"Marble I/Orchard\". By April 1997, Jeff had re-assumed the Testube moniker for his solo music project. Testube originated in Englewood, Colorado and relocated to Eureka Springs, Arkansas in 2006.\nIn 2011, Testube released a cover version of Pixies track \"Wave of Mutilation\" to raise charity donations for the Japanese Red Cross Society in the wake of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.\nIn October 2021, Testube released a new song and video titled \"Themself\" as a charity fundraiser for Cyndi Lauper's True Colors United organization.\n\n\n== Music charts ==\nReconstructive Surgery, an album of Testube songs remixed by Danos and other artists, appeared on the CMJ national RPM top-20 charts for six weeks in the Autumn of 2000, peaking at the number 4 chart position that September.\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nAustralian journal Blatant Propaganda praised Testube's Bioplaza album for its \"gothic-medieval melodies and dreamy electronic-body-music\".  Chain D.L.K. website reviewed Corporation album stating it is \"not for the timid or pop oriented, yet still fully functional on the dancefloor!\"   Regarding Testube's Off-Purpose album, UK-based Sphere Magazine wrote \"this collection has personality that cannot be turned off or even ignored.\"  StarVox Webzine proclaimed \"Testube are an anomaly. Brilliant beyond measure, and yet criminally overlooked... How does this work, people? How is it that Testube isn't spoken of with the same reverence as Skinny Puppy? The material is that good, let me assure you.\"\n\n\n== Remixing ==\nJeff Danos has remixed other electronic music groups, including Torrent Vaccine, Destroid, Ptyl, I,Parasite, Skin Contact, Pain Station, Burikusu!!!, Thine Eyes, Left Spine Down, the Unter Null side-project Stray, Diverje, B! Machine, Monstrum Sepsis, Paranoid Axis, Biopsy, White Trash Compactor, Leæther Strip (for the single Carry Me) and works by fellow Glim Records recording artist LowHero DLL. Jeff's audio post-production is often credited as a Testube \"remix\" or \"treatment\".\n\n\n== Live performance ==\nTestube rarely plays in a live context, as it is primarily a studio music project.  However, there have been a handful of live performances, the first of which was in 1996 at Cafe Euphrates in Denver, CO. Albuquerque, NM is the only other city to host live shows with Testube.\n\n\n== Film composing ==\nJeff Danos has contributed original music to motion picture soundtracks, including the cult film Sleeping Pills and the short film Refraction.\n\n\n== Record labels ==\nTestube has been associated with UEF (United Endangered Front) Records (1996–1998), DSBP Records (1999–2007), and Glim Records (starting in 2008).\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBelow is a partial Testube discography:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nTestube discography at Discogs"

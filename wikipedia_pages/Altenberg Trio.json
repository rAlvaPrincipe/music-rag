Since its debut during the Salzburg Mozart Week in 1994, it is one of the few full-time piano trios in Europe. The ensemble became Trio-in-residence of Vienna's Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (Musikverein) where it gives an annual series of concerts in the Brahms Saal. Their repertoire encompasses more than 250 piano trios, among them works that were composed for and premiered by the Altenberg Trio, such as Douglas Weiland's First Trio, opus 22 (1995).\nIn 1999, following the release of their recording of the complete Schumann piano trios, the Trio received the Robert Schumann Award of the City of Zwickau.

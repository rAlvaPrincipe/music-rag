    "text": "Essex Chanel a multi-genre musical project formed in 2005 in Chicago, Illinois by Travis Lee Wiggins.\n\n\n== History ==\nWiggins started Essex Chanel to go in a different musical direction than his first band, Fetla. After Fetla went on a 2-year hiatus in 2005, Essex Chanel became Wiggins’s primary project.\nMost of Essex Chanel’s prolific  recorded output is arranged and produced by Wiggins. Wiggins likes to experiment and use different musical styles from release-to-release, sometimes even from song-to-song.  “With each album, I go in a different direction. I challenge myself,”  Wiggins said in the RedEye.\nIn November 2010, Essex Chanel released song number 250, The Good Times. The song was played on Chicago's WXRT-FM's Local Anesthetic.\nIn January 2011, Essex Chanel confirmed they would be a guest on Chic-a-Go-Go.\n\n\n== Musical Style and Influences ==\nEssex Chanel is typically categorized as indie rock, indie pop, or folk pop, but due to the experimentation of Wiggins’ songwriting the music has fallen into an additional variety of music genres, including bluegrass, folk, Americana, dance/electronica, honky-tonk, alternative and classical, while still retaining mostly a pop-influenced base with an emphasis on melody, playfulness and orchestration.\nEssex Chanel is most commonly compared to Ween due to a similarity in the way both bands genre-jump and use a wide array of music influences, as well as the sense of humor both groups have.\nEssex Chanel's release Love is Proximity was compared to Sufjan Stevens, Arcade Fire, and The Magnetic Fields 69 Love Songs.\n\n\n== Collaborators ==\nWiggins has collaborated with many musicians for Essex Chanel: Stephen Dranger, Mike Regan, Allison Trumbo, Aleksandra Lederer, Mitch Nimnicht, Steven Aleck, Robert Pleshar, Micah Travisonno, Brian Koehler, Joseph Khalifah, Luke Krause, Angelina Lucero (who had played with Pretty Good Dance Moves), & Sara Ma.\n\n\n== Music videos ==\nEssex Chanel broke into the national scene in 2010 with the release of a music video for the single \"Skinny Dippin'.\"  The A.V. Club said \"Not many bands can pull off a song about skinny-dipping and have it sound charming instead of creepy, but Essex Chanel is schooled in all kinds of charm, filtered through frontman Travis Lee Wiggins’ vision.\" The video was in rotation on JBTV, MTV Latin America, Fuse TV On Demand, and at the 9:30 Club, among others.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSiren (9.8.2005)\nOne Last Hurrah Before I Die (5.9.2006)\nTravis Wiggins Gets Drunk (7.21-7.24.2006)\n67 Car Commercials (9.17.2006)\n67 Car Commercials BONUS (3.6.2007)\nBiting the Hand that Feeds You (3.13.2007)\nCropcircles (4.8.2007)\nDancing at Weddings (1.18.2008)\nLove is Proximity (9.23.2009)\nLove is Proximity Sessions, Disk 1 (11.24.2009)\nLove is Proximity Sessions, Disk 2 (1.26.2010)\nLove is Proximity Sessions, Disk 3 (3.23.2010)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nSpur of the Moment (7.8.2006)\nFrench With Me (2.14.2011)\n\n\n=== Projects ===\nJanuary 2007 (1.1.2007-1.31.2007)\nThe Album is Dead (5.5.2007)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nTravis Lee Wiggins Interview on Onion Magazine Archived 2010-12-24 at the Wayback Machine\nRedefine Magazine Review 2009 Archived 2010-06-04 at the Wayback Machine"

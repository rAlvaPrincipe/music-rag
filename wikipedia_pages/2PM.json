    "text": "2PM (Korean: 투피엠; RR: Tupiem) is a South Korean boy band formed by JYP Entertainment. The group is composed of six members: Jun. K (formerly known as Junsu), Nichkhun, Taecyeon, Wooyoung, Junho, and Chansung. Originally a seven-piece group, former member Jaebeom (now known professionally as Jay Park) left the group in 2009.\nThrough the documentary series Hot Blood Men, Korean musician Park Jin-young formed an eleven-member band known as One Day. Eventually, the band was split into the hip hop group 2PM and a similar but independent group known as 2AM. 2PM debuted with the song \"10 Out of 10\" (10점 만점에 10점, lit. \"10 Points Out of 10 Points\"), which showcased their acrobatic dance styles. They then achieved their first number 1 single with \"Again & Again\". Both singles were featured on their first studio album, 01:59PM, which was released in 2009. The band went on to release another Korean album, Hands Up, in 2011. They made their Japanese debut later that year with Republic of 2PM. The group enjoyed significant commercial success with their subsequent albums; Grown (2013), Go Crazy (2014), No.5 (2015), and Gentlemen's Game (2016), each of which peaked within the top 3.\nFollowing touring for Gentlemen's Game, the group took an official hiatus in July 2017 due to mandatory military service. Following the members' discharge, 2PM returned with their seventh studio album Must in June 2021.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut ===\nThe members of 2PM all auditioned to join JYP Entertainment, with the exception of Thai-American member Nichkhun, who was scouted as a high school senior in the United States and became the company's first non-ethnic Korean trainee. Jun. K, Wooyoung and Jaebeom were chosen from auditions. Taecyeon, Junho and Chansung had participated in JYP Entertainment's audition program SuperStar Survival; Junho finished as the winner while Taecyeon and Chansung were given trainee contracts despite being eliminated. Some of the members had previously lived in the United States: former leader Jaebeom in the Seattle area, Nichkhun in Southern California, while Taecyeon attended middle and high school in Massachusetts before returning to Korea.\nOriginally, the members of 2PM were part of a larger group known as One Day. A documentary called Hot Blood Men captured the group's training days. In this documentary, former member Jaebeom finished at the top spot and received the most fan votes. It also featured the elimination of three trainees from the group: Lee Swichi, Jeong Jin-woon, and Yoon Doo-joon were all cut. However, Jinwoon replaced Im Daehun upon the latter's withdrawal. By the end of the training process, One Day had been reduced to an eleven-member group. The band was then split into four-member ballad group 2AM and seven-member hip-hop dance-focused group 2PM.\n\n\n=== 2008–2010: Debut and early success, Jaebeom's departure ===\n\nWhile most Korean boy bands at the time adopted a \"pretty boy\" or kkonminam image, 2PM constructed a tough and macho beast-like image when they made their debut. By emphasizing their masculinity, 2PM is known for creating the \"jimseung-dol\" (which translates to beast/animal idol in Korean) phenomenon in 2008. Jaebeom was chosen to serve as the group's leader, as he was the oldest member and also the one who all the members acknowledged as the most talented one. He played key roles in several of the band's early singles and associated music videos.\n2PM debuted with their single album Hottest Time of the Day on August 29, 2008. The album consisted a total of 6 tracks, including its lead single \"10 Out of 10\" (10점 만점에 10점). The group made their debut live performance with a performance of \"10 Out of 10\" on M Countdown on September 4, 2008. The following month, the group released a winter special version of their song \"Only You\", a B-side from their debut mini album. Concurrently, 2PM hosted the third season of Korean variety show Idol Army.\nOn April 16, 2009, the group released their second mini album, 2:00PM Time For Change, which they began promoting that month with the lead single \"Again and Again\". This comeback was met with commercial success, with \"Again and Again\" placing at number one on various music charts including Cyworld, Hanteo, Melon, Mnet, and Muse. The following month, they won their first Mutizen Song award on M Countdown, followed by two more and a Music Bank award. On June 11, 2PM began promotions for their song \"Niga Mipda\" (니가 밉다, lit. I Hate You) on M Countdown. 2PM then achieved first place on the M Countdown and Music Bank charts with \"Niga Mipda\" later in July and on July 30, the group won the 'Only One Song' award on M Countdown. At this time, 2PM also starred in the popular Korean variety show Wild Bunny.\nA controversy regarding Jaebeom emerged when on September 4, 2009, articles surfaced on the internet regarding his posts from 2005 made on his personal Myspace account, in which he expressed his dislike for Korea while he was still a trainee for JYP Entertainment. These posts, leaked by a netizen who hacked his Myspace account, were taken out of context and severely misinterpreted by the Korean media. Jaebeom issued an apology regarding this matter. Although some netizens demanded that Jaebeom should be forced out of 2PM, JYP Entertainment CEO Park Jin-young stated on September 7 that he lent the singer a vote of confidence, suggesting that Jaebeom would remain in the group. However, on the following day, Jaebeom announced on his official Fancafé that he would leave the group and return to the United States for a while to calm the situation. He planned to return to school and improve his understanding of music. At the same time, he apologized to his fellow band members for not being a good leader and older brother for them. He also promised to come back as a better person. Park Jin-young confirmed that 2PM would continue on as a six-member group. Due to the sensitive topic of Jaebeom's departure, 2PM withdrew for several weeks from their appearances on variety shows.\nDespite the controversy, the group went ahead with the release of their first studio album. Known as 01:59PM, the album was released on November 10, 2009. In response to lingering questions regarding Jaebeom's future, Park Jin-young announced on the day after the release of 01:59PM that Jaebeom could return to 2PM if he wished to make a comeback, although the singer's return was not imminent. In support of Jaebeom, the six remaining 2PM members decided to equally split their income from their first album with him. The album included tracks voiced by Jaebeom, although his face was excluded from the cover. The group finished re-filming their music video for the album's lead single \"Heartbeat\", without Jaebeom in October 2009. The group then began promotional activities for the album on a variety of music shows, including Mnet's O Good Concert, KBS' Music Bank, MBC's Music Core and SBS' Inkigayo in November 2009.\nA week and a half after the album's release, 2PM performed at the Mnet Asian Music Awards on November 21, 2009, and took home the awards for Best Male Group and Artist of the Year, the latter being one of the three most prestigious awards of the show. The group paid homage to Jaebeom during their performance of \"Again & Again\". During the performance, a spotlight shone over Jaebeom's usual position in the dance formation, and his vocals played over the speakers without being replaced.\nIn late November 2009, after two weeks of promotional activities for 1:59PM, 2PM earned their first #1 on a TV music show (KBS Music Bank's \"K-Chart\") since the album's release, with their single \"Heartbeat\", which went on to take #1 on the K-Chart for three more weeks. In addition, \"Heartbeat\" achieved the Mutizen Triple Crown song award on SBS' Inkigayo by being the #1 song on the program's \"Take 7\" chart for three weeks, the maximum amount of time for which a nominated song is eligible to win. On December 30, 2009, at Korean Broadcasting System (KBS)'s end of the year Music Festival, \"Again & Again\" was recognized as \"Song of the Year\", winning with 57,060 votes.\n\n2PM's second single from 01:59PM was \"Tired of Waiting\". The song was performed live for the first time at the SBS Music Festival in December 2009. 2PM's promotion for the album ended with their performance on SBS' Inkigayo in January 2010. In February 2010, JYP Entertainment announced that Jaebeom would not return to 2PM, as his contract with the company had been permanently terminated, with the agreement of all 6 members. A combined fan meeting and press conference was held two days later with the six remaining members of 2PM and JYP Entertainment CEO Choi Jungwook in attendance. Various 2PM fan sites were shut down immediately after the conference as a protest of Jaebeom's termination. The record label then announced that although 2PM would move forward with six members, a new leader would not be chosen to replace Jaebeom. In April 2010, the band released Don't Stop Can't Stop, a mini-album consisting of six tracks. The group intended for the release to illustrate a stronger side of themselves than what was seen in their previous releases. The album was met with much success, with its lead song \"Without U\" ranking atop multiple Korean music charts. The group made their television performance comeback on Mnet's music program M Countdown in April 2010. In the same month, 2PM served as the opening act for nine Wonder Girls summer shows in the United States.In May 2010, 2PM also performed at the eighth annual Korea Times Music Festival in Los Angeles, California, and at the Dream Concert which was held in Seoul. In the same month, 2PM released the song \"What's Your Celebration?\", which is sampled from K'Naan's \"Wavin' Flag\", for the FIFA 2010 World Cup. It was announced that all proceeds from the sales of the song will go to the donation support headed by FIFA World Cup in South Africa. On July 31, 2010, 2PM held their first solo concert \"Don't Stop Can't Stop\" at the Seoul Olympic Park Arena, with their labelmates 2AM and Miss A making guest appearances at the concert. The group held another concert date in Seoul on August 1, before moving to Busan from August 7 to 8, and holding two more encore concerts in Seoul from September 4 to 5 in line with the celebration of their second debut anniversary. It was reported that more than 12,000 fans attended 2PM's first concerts in Seoul. In October 2010, 2PM released their fourth EP, Still 2:00PM, with the lead single \"I'll Be Back\" staying at number one for two consecutive weeks on KBS' Music Bank. On the following month, it was reported that Still 2:00PM debuted unexpectedly on the 13th spot of the Billboard's World Album-Chart even though no album promotions were made in the United States. On October 18, 2PM won the \"Most Popular Asian Singer\" award at the 10th Annual Mandarin Music Honors held at the Wukesong Arena in China. They became the first Korean artist to be granted with the award, with the group performing their songs \"Heartbeat\" and \"I'll Be Back\" at the event.\n\n\n=== 2011–2012: Japanese debut and mainstream success ===\n\n2PM officially made their Japanese debut in December 2010 with their first live platinum showcase titled \"2PM 1st Contact in JAPAN LIVE\" in Japan at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Gymnasium, a place well known for sumo games.\nOn March 9, 2011, 2PM released their first compilation album, All About 2PM, comprising tracks from the group's previously released albums Hottest Time of the Day, 2:00PM Time for Change, 01:59PM, Don't Stop Can't Stop, and Still 2:00PM.

It was the first time 2PM would emcee a program with their name on it.

In addition, 2PM now endorses Calvin Klein South Korea, as well as, most recently, It's Skin, a South Korean cosmetics and skin care brand. In mid-2010, 2PM were chosen along with Girls' Generation to be the spokesperson for Caribbean Bay. Shortly after, the members of 2PM (except for Nichkhun) were chosen to sing the song \"Fly to Seoul (Boom Boom Boom)\" to support tourism in Korea. Due to renewal of their endorsement deal with Samsung, 2PM recorded the song \"Nori For U\" for Samsung Anycall NORi.\nIn April 2021, following the group's return from their hiatus, 2PM became endorsers for sportswear brand Xexymix.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Stage and image ===\n2PM have been credited with originating the term jimseungdol (짐승돌), a portmanteau of the words jimseung (\"beast\" or \"wild animal\") and idol. They opted against the trending youthful kkonminam (\"flower boy\") image, debuting with a more mature \"wild\" and \"beast-like\" image that matched their heights and large physiques. The moniker was further solidified due to their intense performances, mainly main rapper Taecyeon's unique \"tough guy\" rapping style during their earlier releases and his practice of tearing his shirt off at the end during performances of the hit \"Heartbeat\". During their earlier years, they were primarily known for sex appeal, intense performances and stages that often featured at least one member taking off his shirt, which was unheard of among idol groups at that time. Although not the first K-pop group to utilize acrobatics in their performances, they were the first group to regularly incorporate acrobatics-inspired moves into their live performances and choreography, with representative examples being \"10 Out of 10\" (10점 만점에 10점) and \"Heartbeat\". NME noted, \"The group stood out, thanks to their dynamic, acrobatic choreography and hyper masculine image, which cemented them as K-pop's OG 'beast idols'.\"\nBy 2013, the group stopped incorporating acrobatics into their choreography due to injury risks as members entered their mid-twenties. The album Grown has been described as a turning point as for their transition from the unrestrained \"wild, beast-like\" image they debuted with into a more sophisticated and \"discreetly sexy\" image; the choreographies for the album's promoted singles \"A.D.T.O.Y\" (하.니.뿐) and \"Come Back When You Hear This Song\" (이 노래를 듣고 돌아와) were more minimalistic yet \"complex and effusive\".\n\n\n=== Musical style and themes ===\nWhile their discography features diverse genres, 2PM's overall musical style has generally been described as being musically rooted in the R&B genre, often combined with electronic influences. Academic Crystal S. Anderson opined that their later discography strongly leaned towards the R&B genre of \"quiet storm\" as the group transitioned into a sophisticated and mature masculine concept, beginning with the 2013 album Grown. They have occasionally experimented with genres; for example, \"Go Crazy\" (미친거 아니야?), the promoted single of the eponymously named 2014 album, was described as \"[straddling] the line\" between funk and EDM.\nThe songs in their discography range from pop ballads about breaking up such as \"At Times\" (문득) to party anthems such as \"Hands Up\". Some of their songs garnered attention due to the overtly sensual nature of the lyrics. The self-composed \"Make Love\" from Gentlemen's Game was notably banned by the Korean Broadcasting System due to its lyrics describing one's desire to make love with a lover.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMTV Asia stated, \"[They] rose to prominence as their catchy lyrics and easy-to-follow dance moves exploded in the early days of YouTube, long predating today's viral TikTok challenges. They were also the first group to embody the jimseung-dol, or beast-like idol, a charismatic and sensual archetype that has influenced the presentation of newer acts like Monsta X.\" 2PM has been noted for successfully transitioning into a \"manband\" without overly relying on sex appeal gimmicks such as taking off their shirts, with Melon Music's e-magazine dubbing them \"classic K-sexy\" during their 2021 comeback from hiatus. The members of Monsta X themselves, as well as of newer idol groups such as Seventeen, SF9 and labelmates Stray Kids have cited 2PM as \"role models\" for their stage presence and charisma during live performances.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n== Concert tours ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website (in Korean)\n2PM Official Japan (in Japanese)"

    "text": "The Tulla Céilí Band is an Irish céilí band.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was founded in 1946 by Paddy Canny, fellow fiddler P.J. Hayes, pianist Teresa Tubridy, and accordion player Joe Cooley at Minogue's Bar in Tulla, County Clare, Ireland. They were formed in order to compete at the Limerick Fleadh Cheoil. Their initial repertoire came very much from local sources, along with Galway tunes from Joe Cooley.\nThe band won first prize at Féile Luimní the following year and made their debut radio performance broadcast in 1948. In the following decade, they competed in the All Ireland competitions, initiating a rivalry with the Kilfenora Céilí Band, which won the competition in 1954 and 1955. In 1956, Tulla tied Kilfenora for first place in the Munster competition but lost by a half point in the All Ireland. Tulla won first place the following year, however, and won again in 1960.  The band toured Britain and the United States in 1958, delivering a memorable performance at Carnegie Hall in New York on St. Patrick's Day.\nIn 2008, An Post issued a stamp featuring the band.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nRegular band members is the period 1946 - 1997:\n\nFiddle: Paddy Canny - Bobby Casey - Francie Donnellan - Mark Donnellan - Martin Hayes - P.Joe Hayes - Dr. Bill Loughnane - Michael Murphy - Bert McNulty - Peter O'Loughlin - Sean Reid - Jack Shaughnessy - Aggie Whyte\nFlute: Willie Clancy - J.J.

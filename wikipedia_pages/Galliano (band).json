    "text": "Galliano are a London-based acid jazz group that were originally active between 1988 and 1997. The group was the first signing to Eddie Piller and Gilles Peterson's Acid Jazz record label. The original members were Rob Gallagher (vocals – credited as Roberto Galliano), Constantine Weir (vocals), Michael Snaith (The Vibe Controller) and Crispin Robinson (percussion). \nOther important members included Valerie Etienne, who participated in the recording of all their albums, along with other musicians such as Mick Talbot on keyboards, Crispin Taylor on drums, Ernie McKone on bass guitar, Mark Vandergucht guitar, and Steve Ameedee, otherwise known as Uncle Big Man (dancer). Ski Oakenfull replaced Mick Talbot on keyboards in 1994. The band split in November 1997 after musical differences over direction of travel. The band announced a return in 2023, including several live gigs, including several live gigs and a new album that was released in 2024.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe group's first single, a reworking of Curtis Mayfield's Freddie's Dead called Frederick Lies Still, was released in June 1988. It was also the first release on the Acid Jazz label. Their second release was on Let the Good Times Roll by The Quiet Boys in 1989. The Quiet Boys was an alias used by acid jazz pioneer Chris Bangs who then went on to produce Galliano.\nGalliano's first album release was In Pursuit of the 13th Note in 1991, which was produced by Bangs. Their second album A Joyful Noise Unto the Creator was released in 1992.\nGalliano achieved the peak of their success in 1994 with The Plot Thickens which peaked at number eight in the UK Albums Chart. Two UK top 40 singles were released from the album Long Time Gone (a cover of a David Crosby song from the self titled first album by Crosby, Stills & Nash) and Twyford Down. The latter was a comment on the road building protests taking place at the time and the protest at Twyford Down in particular, and they were joined onstage by anti-roads protestors to make appeals to the audience. The album was well received making the NME's list of top 50 albums of the year. Following its release Galliano performed on the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival in 1994 and returned to play the NME Stage in 1995.\nGalliano's fourth and final studio album :4 was released in 1996.  This included the track \"Slack Hands\", which was used in the title sequence of Kevin Reynolds' 1997 film, One Eight Seven, starring Samuel L. Jackson.\nGalliano broke up in 1997. Gallagher together with Etienne formed Two Banks of Four; Gallagher also performs solo using the names Earl Zinger, William Anderson and together with Alex Patchwork as The Diabolical Liberties. \nIn early 2023, Galliano announced a return, including a new album and a few live gigs that year. The band played twice at Gilles Peterson's We Out Here Festival in August 2023, playing covers of \"Harvest for the World\" and \"Uptown Top Ranking\" alongside their original material.\nIn May 2024, they released their first single in 28 years, \"Circles Going Round The Sun\"; in June 2024, they released \"Pleasure, Joy & Happiness\", a cover of a song by Eddie Chacon. Their fifth album, Halfway Somewhere, their first in 28 years, was released on 30 August 2024.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nUntil Such Time (Recorded Live In Europe '92) – 1993 – Talkin' Loud\nLive at Liquid Room (Tokyo) – 1997 – Talkin' Loud\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nWhat Colour Our Flag – 1994 – Talkin' Loud\nThicker Plot (Remixes 93–94) – 1994 – Talkin' Loud\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGalliano discography at Discogs\nGalliano at MusicBrainz"

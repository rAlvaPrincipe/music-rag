    "text": "The Curtis Mayflower is an American rock band formed in Worcester, Massachusetts in 2013. The group consists of lead singer Craig Rawding, guitarist Pete Aleksi, bassist Jeremy Moses Curtis, keyboard player Brooks Milgate, and drummer Duncan Arsenault.\nThe group's debut album \"Everything Beautiful Is Under Attack\" was released on January 28, 2014. In March 2017 the band released their sophomore album \"Death Hoax\" to positive reviews.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore starting The Curtis Mayflower, Brooks Milgate, Duncan Arsenault and Jeremy Moses Curtis played together in The Howl with The Fabulous Thunderbirds guitarist Troy Gonyea. While playing The Howl, Curtis and Gonyea began touring with Booker T. Jones. Curtis also toured internationally as the bassist for Howie Day and has also performed with Levon Helm and Ringo Starr. Duncan Arsenault played drums with Jim Carroll for a series of performances as The Catholic Boys. He has also performed with singer Mark Burgess from The Chameleons UK and is the drummer for The Curtain Society. Craig Rawding also sings in the duo The Marshall Pass with Duncan Arsenault.\nThe band was formed in Worcester, MA while playing at a local bar's weekly music series. All five band members have played together in various incarnations but it wasn't until 2012 that this lineup solidified and began playing together as a group. After a few shows playing old soul and blues, the group began writing original material. This led to the self-released EP \"Live at The Dive\", recorded at the bar they formed at.\nIn February 2013 the band rented a farmhouse in Lamoine, ME and hired engineer Dave Westner to record their debut album. The music was recorded live in a room with little to no separation among the instruments and minimal overdubs.\nIn 2014, they recorded the soundtrack for the film American Mongrel. Joining the group for these sessions was saxophonist Dana Colley of the band Morphine.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCraig Rawding - vocals, harmonica\nDuncan Arsenault - drums\nJeremy Moses Curtis - bass, vocals\nPete Aleksi - guitar, vocals\nBrooks Milgate - keyboards, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDeath Hoax (2017)\n\"Fourth Wall (single)\" (2014)\n\"King of the Fools (single)\" (2014)\nEverything Beautiful Is Under Attack (2014)\nLive at The Dive EP (2013)\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nDiscogs Entry\nMusicBrainz Entry"

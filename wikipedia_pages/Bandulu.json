The group recorded three sessions for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show.\nThe trio have also recorded under the names Thunderground, New Adult, Sons of the Subway, and Space DJz.\nIn his book Energy Flash, Simon Reynolds credited Bandulu as part of the \"Texturology\" subgenre, stating that \"the best tracks on Bandulu's Guidance sounded like jazz-techno, as if Zawinul had somehow ended up band-leader of Tangerine Dream instead of Weather Report\".\n\n\n== Album discography ==\n\nThe CD and vinyl versions of Redemption contained mostly different tracks.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDetailed discography on Discogs\nBandulu at AllMusic\nBandulu at last.fm"

    "text": "M.I.C. (MIC男团) is a five-member Chinese boy band, which started in 2006 and released a debut EP in October 2010. The band has won some of the most important Asian entertainment business awards, including the Top Chinese Music Awards, Shanghai Media Group's \"ERS Chinese Top Ten 2010\" and the Vanguard 2010 Music Event, and released albums in 2011 and 2012.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2006, music company Taihe Rye Music sought to establish an ad-hoc boy band to become the next big thing in the Asian music market. Around 20 out of over 20,000 auditioned talents were chosen to become candidate members of the band, after a nationwide search in hundreds of performing arts schools in more than 20 provinces and cities. The candidates underwent four years of song and dance training. The final five candidates were selected after a talent show on Dragon TV, on March 26, 2010.\nOn July 27, 2010, M.I.C.'s debut single \"Yàomìng de fánnǎo\" (\"Terrible trouble\") was released, and the EP \"ROCK STAR\" followed in October. \"Bàn mèng\" (\"Semi-dream\") was a hit in August 2011, and the music video for another single, \"Fēngbào xiàtiān\" (\"Storm summer\"), became the most watched music video of August 2011.\nTheir first full-length album, V, was released in 2011, with \"Get It Hot\" as the first single.\n\n\n== Members ==\nPhibian (Wang Hao)\nSteelo Z.

Their biggest success came in 1996 when their track \"Stand Up\" reached #1 on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart. It reached #23 in the UK Singles Chart in July that year. Their only other chart single was a remix of their first - in 2001 \"Stand Up\" hit #5 after it was reworked by Thunderpuss.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one dance hits (United States)\nList of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chart\n\n\n== References =="

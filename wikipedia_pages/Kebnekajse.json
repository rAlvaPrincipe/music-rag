    "text": "Kebnekajse is a Swedish band that was most active during the 1970s after its members left the Mecki Mark Men. The band was greatly influenced by both traditional Swedish folk music and African music. The name is taken from Kebnekaise, the highest mountain in Sweden. The spelling of the band name was originally the correct spelling of the mountain, but for the last two albums (Kebnekajse and Idioten), it was changed it to the present spelling.\nThe band categorised itself as progressive rock but, at the time in Sweden, progressiveness was a political rather than a musical concept.\nThe band uses guitar, violin, congas, drums, bass and other instruments. Kebnekajse played a variety of styles starting from hard rock, but moved to folk music, symphonic rock and jazz fusion. With the 2009 album, the band returned to progressive folk.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\nKenny Håkansson – guitar, vocals (1971–1977, 2001–present)\nPelle Ekman – drums, vocals (1971–1977, 2001–present)\nHassan Bah – percussion, vocals (1972–1978, 2001–present)\nMats Glenngård – electric violin, guitar, mandolin, vocals (1972–1978, 2001–present)\nGöran Lagerberg – bass, guitar, vocals (1972–1975, 2001–present)\nFormer members\nRolf Scherrer – guitar (1971–1973)\nBella Linnarsson – bass (1971–1972)\nIngemar Böcker – guitar (1972–1975, 2001–2006)\nPelle Lindström – guitar, harmonica (1972–1975, 2001–2004)\nGunnar Andersson – drums (1972–1974)\nPelle Holm – drums, vocals (1977–1978)\nPer Lejring – keyboard (1977–1978)\nThomas Netzler – bass, drums, vocals (1972–1978, 2001–2023)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nResa mot okänt mål (1971) (Journey to an unknown destination)\nKebnekajse II (1973)\nKebnekajse III (1975)\nLjus från Afrika (1976) (Lights from Africa)\nElefanten (1976) (The elephant)\nVi drar vidare (1978) (We press on)\nElectric Mountain (1993) – compilation album\nResa mot okänt mål (2001) – remastered\nKebnekajse (2009)\nIdioten (2011)\nAventure (2012)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

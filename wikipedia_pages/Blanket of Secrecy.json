    "text": "Blanket of Secrecy (BoS) was a short-lived English new wave band formed in 1982. The band was notable for the fact that its band members, true to their band name, were never officially identified at the time - only the pseudonyms Tinker, Tailor and Soldier were disclosed to refer to the main members - as well as mention of Spy.  This led to some speculation in the music press regarding the true identity of the members, with rumours that they might be the Attractions (Elvis Costello's backing band) and speculation that the lead singer was Jack Hues of Wang Chung. However, they were eventually revealed to be Peter Marsh (Tinker, the lead singer), Andy Howell (Tailor), Roger Bechirian (Soldier) and Phil McWalter (Spy).  \nTheir music was synth-pop, similar to their contemporaries A Flock of Seagulls, although comparisons to the Attractions were also made.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Releases and chart history ===\nThe band's first LP was titled Walls Have Ears in the UK, and Ears Have Walls in the US.  The album cover, ultimately to become an iconic classic, was designed by Barney Bubbles. The group can be seen in shadow on the album's back cover, in a photo by Brian Griffin, and in mostly obscured images on the cover of the single \"Say You Will\".  They are seen full-face, and much more clearly, in the video for \"Say You Will\". Released in 1982, the album and single received significant airplay on both sides of the Atlantic, featuring in the Tipperade in the Netherlands for four weeks.\nAt the time Ears Have Walls was recorded, BoS also recorded an entire second album, but the band broke up before it was released. It was eventually released, known simply as \"2\" on 24 August 2017 through Trick Records\n\n\n=== Speculation about the band's identity ===\nAt the time of the group's one and only LP release, there were three main theories about the identity of the musicians involved with Blanket of Secrecy. \n\nTheory No. 1: Because of the album credit \"Directed by Roger Bechirian\", all songs and instruments must be by Bechirian.\nTheory No. 2: Some thought the album was actually by the Attractions. Known primarily as Elvis Costello's backing group, the Attractions (a three-piece band, just like BoS) had issued one LP in 1980 that had been produced by Bechirian. Additionally, the Attractions were known to favour pseudonyms—the \"Brain/Hart\" writing team that penned several songs on their 1980 album Mad About The Wrong Boy was later revealed to be Attractions keyboardist Steve Nieve and his wife, poet and lyricist Fay Hart.  Finally, the Attractions shared the same music publishing company as Blanket of Secrecy (Plangent Visions Music, Inc.), the same record label (F-Beat), and the same management company (Jake Riviera's Riviera Global Productions).\nTheory No. 3:  Several reviews at the time mentioned the name Peter Marsh as the possible main-man of the band. Marsh had been an original member of Easy Street, a mellow acoustic act of the 1970s whose ranks also included Richard James Burgess. Marsh had formed New Wave band Twist, which released one album in 1979, and he subsequently went on to produce plenty of synth-pop in the 1980s, collaborating with artists including Vangelis.\n\n\n=== Actual identity ===\nExtensive research by Blanket of Secrecy fan Gary L. Maher eventually identified the participants definitively as:\n\nPeter Marsh (\"Tinker\") – vocals and guitar\nRoger Bechirian (\"Soldier\") – keyboards and backing vocals, percussion, producer, engineer and mixer\nAndy Howell (\"Tailor\") – bass and backing vocals\nJack Hues of Wang Chung also confirmed the identity of Peter Marsh in an interview by Russell A. Trunk for Exclusive Magazine. \nAdditionally, the single \"Say You Will\" bears a writing credit of Tinker/Spy.  ASCAP has identified \"Spy\" as Phil McWalter. The song \"Yo Yo\" was credited to Tinker/Sailor, and Maher has identified \"Sailor\" as artist Ron Chadwick. \nThe Attractions connection trumpeted by some was proven to have been entirely incorrect, as no involvement by any of the Attractions in the Blanket of Secrecy project has ever come to light, although Pete Thomas played drums on two songs recorded for the second, never-released album - and Elvis Costello had performed as a backing vocalist on the track \"Ads\", released as a single several years earlier by Peter Marsh's former band, Twist. The song \"Lovers\", meanwhile, was written by Jack Hues and Nick Feldman (a.k.a. Nick De Spig) of Wang Chung, and arranged by Hues.  One-time Wang Chung member \"Hogg\" (Dave Burnand) also appears on the album.  The connection between the two bands is that Bechirian co-produced Wang Chung's first album, back when that group was known as Huang Chung.\n\n\n=== Life before and after Blanket of Secrecy ===\n\nAll three BoS members had a hand in Carlene Carter's C'est C Bon record from 1983.  Bechirian produced, and all three played on the album, as well as co-writing two of the songs.  Bechirian also produced Nick Lowe's 1983 album The Abominable Showman, which featured backing vocals from Marsh and a Marsh–Howell song called \"Cool Reaction\".\n\nPeter Marsh's musical career goes back at least to 1974, when he released a record with brother-in-law Ken Nicol under the name Nicol & Marsh (a.k.a. Nicol & Marsh's Easy Street). They then changed their name to Easy Street after Richard James Burgess joined and put out two records in 1976 and 1977. Their last record together was a 1978 release called simply Nicol & Marsh. Marsh's next project was Twist, which put out one album called This Is Your Life (1979). Between then and BoS, he also worked with Vangelis, with whom he released the single \"Don't Be Foolish\" in 1980 and Manfred Mann's Earth Band, and released solo singles including \"You Say You Wanna Love Me\" (1981, produced by Godley & Creme) and \"Harmony\" (1984).\nRoger Bechirian is a noted producer, having worked with Huang Chung (Wang Chung), Elvis Costello, Squeeze, Nick Lowe, Dave Edmunds, Carlene Carter, Trash Can Sinatras, the Undertones, Bell X1 and the reunited Monkees.\nAndrew Howell is best known for having co-written The Monkees' reunion single \"Heart and Soul\", from Pool It!.  He co-wrote and played many of the instruments on Simon Byrne's album Dream Crazy. He also played bass on Robert Ellis Orrall's Contain Yourself.  Prior to BoS, Howell was also the bass player in South London punk band The Red Lights. He worked on a number of projects, including The Unbroken Ponies with former Red Lights manager Harry Rogers and Steve Young, lead guitarist of 1970s South London band Stone Cold Sober.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nEars Have Walls (US, Warner Bros.

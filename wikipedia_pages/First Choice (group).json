    "text": "First Choice is an American girl group and vocal music trio from Philadelphia. Their R&B and disco hits included \"Armed and Extremely Dangerous\", \"Smarty Pants\", \"The Player (Part 1)\", \"Guilty\", \"Love Thang\", and \"Doctor Love\". They were signed to soul label Philly Groove and to disco label Gold Mind, and later to Warner Bros. and Salsoul.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFirst Choice began singing in high school as the Debonettes. The group consisted of lead singer Rochelle Fleming, Annette Guest, Wardell Piper and Malanie McSears. They performed in clubs after school in and around Philadelphia. They were introduced to record man Norman Harris by radio DJ Georgie Woods. Harris produced their first single \"This Is the House Where Love Died\". The single failed to chart nationally but was played in Philadelphia and dance club across the U.S. Their next release was \"Armed and Extremely Dangerous\". The single quickly became an R&B top 11 hit in early 1973 and making the UK top 20. \nWardell Piper quit the group to go solo before their first album was released, and is not pictured on the sleeve although she did sing on the album. She was replaced by singer Joyce Jones. Their new hit enabled the group to get national exposure on TV shows such as Dinah, Soul Train, and American Bandstand. Other R&B hits followed. \"Smarty Pants\" went to number 25 R&B and became the group's biggest UK single reaching number 9 in the UK Singles Chart, \"Newsy Neighbors\" and \"The Player\" which became their biggest R&B hit peaking at number 7.\nThe band switched labels in 1976 to Warner Bros. Records. Jones left the group and was replaced by Ursula Herring. At Warner's they recorded dance floor hits including \"Gotta Get Away From You Baby\", \"Ain't He Bad\" and the album title song, \"So Let Us Entertain You\". In 1977, the trio switched labels again this time recording for their producer Norman Harris' label, Gold Mind Records, where they got their biggest dance single, the infectious \"Doctor Love\". The single was from their album, Delusions, that AllMusic critic Ed Hogan regarded as the trio's best LP. The next release came in March 1979 called Hold Your Horses. Ursula Herring left and was replaced by Debbie Martin. The LP contained the dance hits \"Love Thang\", \"Double Cross\" and the title track \"Hold Your Horses\".\nThe trio officially disbanded in 1980 however, in 1983, Salsoul Records released \"Let No Man Put Asunder\" from their 1977 album, Delusions. That single rose to number 13 on the Billboard dance chart and has become the group's signature song and still a current favorite on the house music scene.\nRochelle Fleming continued to record and perform internationally as a solo artist. Annette Guest became a successful songwriter writing for artists such as Stephanie Mills.\n\n\n== Legacy and re-union ==\n\nThe group was influential to early house and techno music, because of sampling by many artists, including Todd Terry and the Jungle Brothers, mostly from First Choice's 1977 track, \"Let No Man Put Asunder\". The track was also covered by Mary J. Blige on her 1999 album, Mary.\nOn August 6, 2014, First Choice performed a reunion concert at East River Bandshell, New York City, with original members Rochelle Fleming, Annette Guest, Wardell Piper and Ursula Herring. The concert featured many of the group's ex-label mates from Salsoul Records. The group is still performing, but without Rochelle Fleming. Annette Guest and Ursula Herring, along with Andre Jackson, are currently performing as The First Choice.\nIn 2019, rapper J. Cole sampled their song \"Wake Up to Me\" in his song \"Middle Child\".\n\n\n== Members timeline ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nThe Best of the First Choice (1976, Kory)\nGreatest Hits (1992, Salsoul)\nPhilly Golden Classics (1994, Collectables)\nThe Best of First Choice (1994, Southbound)\nGreatest Hits (1996, The Right Stuff)\nThe Best of First Choice (1997, Charly)\nThe Best of First Choice: Armed & Extremely Dangerous (1999, Philly Groove)\nThe Ultimate Club Collection (2001, Philly Groove/The Right Stuff/Capitol/EMI)\nThe Anthology (2005, Suss'd)\nThe Greatest Hits: It's Not Over (2006, Koch)\nThe Best of First Choice (2007, Metro Doubles)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFirst Choice at AllMusic\nFirst Choice discography at the Soulwalking Web Site\nFirst Choice discography at Discogs"

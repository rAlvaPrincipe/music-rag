In an interview with Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gomez said: \"I'm going to be in a band. I'm not going to be a solo artist ... I don't want my name attached to it. I will be singing...\" Gomez later announced on Twitter that her band would be called The Scene, an \"ironic jab\" at people who called Gomez a \"wannabe scene\". Gomez stated that her label, Hollywood Records, did not want her to have a band due to Gomez already having a \"fan base\", leading her to name the band Selena Gomez & the Scene to keep both herself and the label happy. In an interview with Z100 New York, Gomez stated that the band was formed through a long and exhausting audition process, saying that although she would preferably like \"all guys\" in the band, she was mainly looking for someone who's \"very passionate about music and can show me that they can rock out. I like having people with me to lean on and write with and have fun with.\"\nThe band's original line-up featured Gomez on vocals, Ethan Roberts on lead guitar and backing vocals, Greg Garman on drums, Joey Clement on bass guitar, and Nick Foxer on keyboard and backing vocals.

    "text": "Denki Groove (電気グルーヴ, Denki Gurūvu, \"Electric Groove\") is a Japanese music group founded in 1989. It consists of Takkyu Ishino and Pierre Taki.\n\n\n== History ==\nDenki Groove was founded in 1989 by Takkyu Ishino and Pierre Taki, both of whom are natives of Shizuoka, Shizuoka Prefecture. They formed on April 26, the same day their predecessor group, ZIN-SÄY! disbanded.\nThe group's major-label debut studio album, Flash Papa, was released in 1991, the first being 662 BPM by DG in 1990. They also released a few albums, including U.F.O. (1991), Karateka (1992), Vitamin (1993), Dragon (1994), Orange (1996), A (1997), and Voxxx (2000). Their single, \"Shangri-La\", had sold more than half a million copies. They went on hiatus between 2001 and 2004.\nIn 2019, Pierre Taki was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession. In response, Sony Music Entertainment Japan took Denki Groove's recordings off the shelves and stopped streaming the group's music. Streaming services were resumed on June 19, 2020.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\n\nTakkyū Ishino – vocals, production (1989–present)\nPierre Taki – vocals, production (1989–present)\nFormer members\n\nMimio – guitar (1989–1990)\nKoji Takahashi – production (1989–1990)\nJun Kitagawa (CMJK) – production, turntables (1990–1991)\nYoshinori Sunahara – production (1991–1999)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n662 BPM by DG (1990)\nFlash Papa (1991)\nU.F.O.

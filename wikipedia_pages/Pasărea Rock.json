    "text": "Pasărea Rock (English: \"The Rock Bird\") is a Romanian rock supergroup formed in February 2014, in Bucharest, Romania by three former members of the legendary band Transsylvania Phoenix: Mircea Baniciu (lead vocals), Josef Kappl (bass), and Ovidiu Lipan (drums). The first line-up included another Transsylvania Phoenix member — Cristi Gram on lead guitar — along with Vlady Cnejevici on keyboards and Teo Boar on guitar. Later, they were replaced by Sorin Voinea (keyboards) and Nicu Patoi (lead guitar). \nThe band's sound is a fusion between modern rock and traditional folk music, along with symphonic elements. Most of the new songs are composed by Josef Kappl; the lyrics are written mainly by Florin Dumitrescu. The setlist of Pasărea Rock also includes a few songs borrowed from Transsylvania Phoenix repertory and from Mircea Baniciu's solo career. In September 2016, Pasărea Rock released its first full-length album: Legenda (The Legend). In December 2020, founding member Mircea Baniciu is replaced by Codruț Croitoru.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nJosef Kappl – bass guitar, keyboards, vocals, songwriter, leader (since February 2014)\nOvidiu Lipan – drums, percussion (since February 2014)\nSorin Voinea – keyboards, programming, backing vocals (since May 2015)\nNicu Patoi – electric and acoustic guitars (since August 2015)\nNarcis Tran-Korsar – acoustic and double-six guitars, vocals (since December 2018)\nCodruț Croitoru – lead vocals (since December 2020)\nMircea Baniciu – lead vocals, acoustic guitar (February 2014–December 2020)\nCristi Gram – electric and acoustic guitars (February 2014–August 2015)\nVlady Cnejevici – keyboards, programming, backing vocals (February 2014–May 2015)\nTeo Boar – electric and acoustic guitars (February 2014–May 2015)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nPe Argeș în jos (On Argeș downstream) (promotional maxi-single, 2008) 1\nLegenda (The Legend) (promotional maxi-single, 2014)\nCălușandra (The Calusandra) (promotional EP, 2015)\nLegenda (The Legend) (studio album, 2016)\nCavalcada (The Cavalcade) (studio album, 2021)\nNote\n\n1 – Released as a maxi-single by Baniciu & Kappl, before the establishment of Pasărea Rock.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPasărea Rock on Discogs\nPasărea Rock on YouTube\nPasărea Rock on Facebook"

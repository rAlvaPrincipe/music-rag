    "text": "The Famines are a Canadian indie rock band formed in 2008 in Edmonton, Alberta. The two piece band uses a modern and minimalistic approach that draws comparison to mid 1970s protopunk and fuzzy garage rock. The band name is meant to be a commentary on the continued feeling of emptiness and lacking in a society that is materially fulfilled. The band has two members, R. E. Biesinger on guitar and vocals, and Drew Demers on the drums.\nIn 2020, The Famines announced that they had become a music publishing company called Pentagon Black.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMusic of Canada\nCanadian rock\nList of Canadian musicians\nList of bands from Canada\nCategory:Canadian musical groups\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.thefamines.ca - Official website\nhttp://profile.myspace.com/thefamines - Band Myspace Page\nhttp://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/12785 - album review, The Gauntlet\nhttp://seemagazine.com/article/music/music-review/cds-famines-plus-nerd-hold-steady-and-bob-sinclar/ - album review, See Magazine\nhttp://www.vueweekly.com/article.php?id=9004 â€“ release review, Vue Weekly"

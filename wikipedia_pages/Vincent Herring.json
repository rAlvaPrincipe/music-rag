Known for his fiery and soulful playing in the bands of Horace Silver, Freddie Hubbard, and Nat Adderley in the earlier stages of his career, he now frequently performs around the world with his own groups and is heavily involved in jazz education.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, United States. His parents divorced, and he and his mother moved to California. When he was 11, he started playing saxophone in school bands and studying privately at Dean Frederick's School of Music in Vallejo, California. At age 16, he entered California State University, Chico on a music scholarship.\nA year later, Herring auditioned for the United States Military Academy band, Jazz Knights, playing lead alto sax. He moved to West Point and served one enlisted tour. In 1982 he moved to New York City attending Long Island University.\nHerring first toured the United States and Europe as part of the Lionel Hampton Big Band. His talents came to the attention of Nat Adderley, and the two forged a nine-year musical relationship that led to nine albums and touring around the world year after year. After Adderley's death, Herring collaborated with former Cannonball Adderley bandmember Louis Hayes to form the Cannonball Adderley Legacy Band. He also worked and recorded with pianist Cedar Walton for over two decades. He has also appeared on stage or recordings with Dizzy Gillespie, Horace Silver, Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Jack DeJohnette's Special Edition, Freddie Hubbard, James Carter, Larry Coryell, Steve Turre, the Mingus Big Band, Billy Taylor, Nancy Wilson, Kenny Barron, Roy Hargrove, Arthur Taylor, Carla Bley, Mike LeDonne, Eric Alexander, Wallace Roney, Carl Allen, Bobby Watson, Gary Bartz, Sonny Fortune, Cyrus Chestnut, Jeremy Pelt, Joe Farnsworth, and the Phil Woods Sax Machine (a band augmenting Woods' regular quintet to an octet with three additional alto saxophonists). Herring has appeared as a special guest soloist with Wynton Marsalis at Lincoln Center as well as with Jon Faddis and The Carnegie Hall Big Band.\nHerring has recorded over 20 albums as a leader and over 250 as a sideman. In addition to the Cannonball Adderley Legacy Band, Herring's other projects include Something Else, The Battle with Vincent Herring and Eric Alexander, The Vincent Herring-Joris Dudli's Soul Jazz Alliance, Earth Jazz Agents, and Jazz The Story.\nHerring has taken bands to Japan, Europe, and China on several occasions and has appeared in nearly every major jazz festival in the world. He is also involved in jazz education as a professor at William Paterson University and Manhattan School of Music. In 2024, Herring published his jazz improvisation method book, Logic and Critical Thinking in Jazz Improvisation, with Sher Music, which focuses on distilling his original improvisation concepts and techniques.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== As leader or co-leader ===\n1989: Scene One (Evidence)\n1990: American Experience (MusicMasters)\n1991: Evidence (Landmark)\n1993: Dawnbird (Landmark)\n1993: Secret Love (MusicMasters)\n1994: Folklore: Live at the Village Vanguard (MusicMasters)\n1994: The Days of Wine & Roses (MusicMasters)\n1995: Don't Let It Go (MusicMasters)\n1997: Change the World (MusicMasters)\n1999: Jobim for Lovers (MusicMasters)\n2001: Simple Pleasure (HighNote)\n2001: Burn'in the Blues (Consolidated Artists Productions) with Jeff Palmer, John Abercrombie, Bob Leto\n2003: All Too Real (HighNote)\n2004: Mr. Wizard (HighNote)\n2005: The Battle: Live at Smoke (HighNote)\n2006: Ends and Means (HighNote)\n2007: Live at Smoke (SGM)\n2010: Morning Star (Challenge)\n2011: Friendly Fire: Live at Smoke (HighNote)\n2012: In the Spirit of Coltrane and Cannonball (Yanagisawa)\n2014: The Uptown Shuffle (Smoke Sessions)\n2015: Night and Day (Smoke Sessions)\n2017: Hard Times (Smoke Sessions)\n2019: Bird at 100 (Smoke Sessions)\n2021: Preaching to the Choir (Smoke Sessions)\n2024: Soul Jazz (Smoke Sessions)\n\n\n=== As sideman ===\nAlto Legacy Alto Summit w/Phil Woods (Fantasy)\nBarney McAll Blueprints\nBarney McAll Quintet Exit (BME)\nBenard Purdie's Soul To Jazz 2 (ACT)\nCarl Allen Quintet The Pursuer (Atlantic)\nCarl Allen Quintet w/Nicholas Payton Testimonial (Atlantic)\nCarl Allen Quintet w/Roy Hargrove Piccadilly Square (Alfa)\nCedar Walton Composer (Astor Place, 1996)\nCedar Walton One Flight Down (HighNote, 2006)\nCedar Walton Seasoned Wood (HighNote, 2008)\nCedar Walton The Bouncer (HighNote, 2011)\nCedar Walton The Promise Land (HighNote, 2001)\nCedar Walton Voices Deep Within (HighNote, 2009)\nDave Ellis State of Mind (Milestone, 2003)\nDon Braden Sextet Art of the Saxophone (BMG)\nDon Braden Sextet (Double-Time, 2000)\nDonald Brown Quintet People Music (Muse)\nEddie Allen Quintet Another Point of View (Enja)\nElio Villafranca Standing By The Crossroads (ArtistShare, 2024)\nEric Alexander and Mike LeDonne Heavy Hitters (Cellar Music, 2022)\nEric Alexander and Mike LeDonne That's What's Up!

    "text": "Centr (Russian: Центр) is a Russian hip hop group formed in Moscow, Russia. Originally composed of Guf, Princip aka Prince, Slim aka Slimus, Ptaha aka Zanuda. In 2008 the group was the winner of the MTV Russia Music Award for Best Hip Hop Project. The group Centr is the founder of the «ЦАО Records»  label.\nAfter Guf left Centr in 2009, rumours about the group's breakup began to appear. In 2010 at the “Russian Street Awards” the category for the \"Biggest Hip-Hop Event of the Year\" in Russia, \"the Collapse of the group Centr\" was chosen. From 2009 - 2012, the group included just Slim and Ptaha. In 2014, after a 5-year hiatus,  it was announced that the group would be re-established.  On May 14, 2016, the group played their last show in Frankfurt am Main, Germany and officially announced their disbandment. All of the members of the group continue to release solo projects.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was formed in 2004 in Moscow, Russia by rappers Guf aka Rolexx and Princip aka Prince. Originally they wrote an unofficial album, \"Подарок\" (Podarok / Gift), but only 13 copies of it were made and the rappers gifted it to their friends for the New Year.\nIn 2002, Alex Dolmatov also professionally known as Guf, started working on his first album, \"Подарок\" (Podarok / Gift). It was released in 2005.\nIn 2006 Guf, Slim & Ptaha wrote down the songs, \"Мутные Замуты\" (Mutnye Zamuty / Cloudy Trafficking), and \"Жара 77\" (\"Heat 77\") specially for the movie \"Heat\".\nAt the end of 2006, members of Centr created a label \"ЦАО records\"; where the group called ‘Dymovaya Zavesa’ including rapper Smoky Mo released the album - \"Этажи\" (Etazhi / Floors).\nIn 2007 Guf released his debut album \"Город Дорог\" (\"Gorod Dorog\" / \"City Of Roads\"). In Russia it was recognized as one of the best albums of the year.\nOn October 25, 2007 the group Centr released its debut album \"Kacheli\" (Качели / Swings). Princip, the co-founder of the group came out of prison and after his release wrote down the songs, \"Железное небо\" (Zheleznoe Nebo / Iron Sky), and \"Исповедь\" (Ispoved' / Confession) ft. Centr. All the songs were included in their debut album \"Качели\" (Kacheli / Swings).\nIn 2007 Guf and rapper Basta were the ones to write a second soundtrack, for the movie \"Бой с тенью 2: Реванш\" (Bou’ S ten'yu 2: Revansh /Shadowboxing 2: Revenge\") the track was titled, \"Моя игра\" (My Game / Moya Igra).\nOn September 9, 2008 the group performed on the Day of the Actor Broadcast on A-One (TV channel).\nThe group Centr, together with rapper Basta won the award \"MTV RMA\" for the song, \"City Of Roads\" from their debut album \"Kacheli\" (Качели / Swings)\nIn 2008 Centr released their second album, \"Эфир в норме\" (Broadcast's Normal / Efir V Norme). The main themes of the project were Moscow streets, drugs and police.\nIn 2008 the group became the main headliner of the 1st day of the International Splash Festival!, in Russia carried out in Moscow in a big skatepark called \"Adrenaline\", the event was organized by Phlatline.\nIn the summer of 2009 Princip was arrested again. In June that same summer, rapper Guf left the group. The rapper declared his departure in an infamous interview.\nAt the end of 2009 rapper Slim released his debut album \"Холодно\" (Holodno / Cold) and a music video to the track of the same name. In October 2009, Ptaha aka Zanuda released his debut album \"Ни о чем\" (Ni o chom / About Nothing). In December 2009, Guf released his second album \"Дома\" (Doma / Homes).\nOn January 7, 2010 Ptaha aka Zanuda in an interview declared the group's disintegration. However, despite that, Centr tours (now just as Slim & Ptaha aka Zanuda) proceeded as planned. After the dissolution of the group the music video for the song, \"Легко ли быть молодым\" (Legko li byt' molodym / Is being young easy) was released. It was released because under the terms of the contract with the record label, Centr was supposed to record two music videos for their second album \"Эфир в норме» (Efir v Norme / Broadcast's Normal). Each participant of the group were recorded separately, at different times and in different places so they didn't see each other (though Slim and Ptaha often crossed and hung out).\nOn November 3, 2011 after long transfers and collaborations, a collaboration album between a young music group called ‘Легенды ПРО’ (Legediu Pro/ Legends PRO) and the remaining members of Centr was in the works. The album was titled, \"Легенды ПРО... Centr\" (\"Legends PRO(about)… Centr\") and was finally released to positive critical reception. The simple album title is actually a careful wordplay on words, because \"Pro\" (\"professional\") also means \"About\" in Russian - so the title can be read as either \"Legends PRO... (&) Centr\" or \"Legends (ABOUT) Centr\".\nIn March, 2012 at the Hip-Hop Award Stadium “RUMA 2012” the album \"Legends PRO… Centr\" won the \"Album Of the Year\" and rapper Slim also won the nomination for \"Rapper Of the Year\".\nIn October 2014, rap.ru (one of the biggest rap-sites in Russia; similar to XXL in the US), published an interview with all of the three original members of Centr - Guf, Slim & Ptaha who after three years started recording together again.\nIn 2015 Centr as Guf, Slim & Ptaha have gone on a Russia-wide Concert tour. On September 21, when performing in Krasnoyarsk, Russia; Guf and Slim were arrested after the show and charged for \"usage of drugs\". A serious crime in Russia however both were released on September 27 with no further charges pressed. In 2016 Centr recorded their latest album «Система» (Sistema / The System).\nIn 2017 Guf & Slim came together to form the duo ‘GuSli’ and released 2 albums together. On June 15, 2017 they released the album “GuSli”. On November 17, 2017 they released the second “GuSli II” album. The artists came up with the names for both albums by combining the first letters of both artists pseudonyms.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2007 - «Качели» (Kacheli/Swing)(Guf/Slim/Птаха)\n2008 - «Эфир в норме» (Efir v norme /Ether's Аine)\n2011 - «Легенды про… Centr» (Legendy pro ... centr / Legends about Centr) feat.

    "text": "Fight (stylized as FIGHT) is the fifth studio album released by the Japanese boy band Kanjani Eight. Fight was announced on September 8, 2011, as a new untitled album. On October 17, 2011, its release date and title were announced. There were three versions of this release: a 2 Disc regular edition and two CD+DVD limited editions. The first press release of the regular edition contains 7 trading cards while limited editions A and B contain a 48-page photo book. It was released on November 16, 2011. This album marked one year and three weeks since the release of their previous album, 8 Uppers.\nProduction for Fight began with the announcement of a triple single release along the course of three months: \"T.W.L/Yellow Pansy Street\", \"My Home\", \"365 Nichi Kazoku\". These singles served as the theme songs for a movie and two television dramas. Another single, \"Tsubusa ni Koi\", was released in August 2011. All, of which, were commercial successes. Fight is a pop/rock-oriented album that incorporates elements of dance, R&B, ska and other genres to fill out the overall production.  The album uses several instruments such as horns, drums, guitars, strings, and synthesizers. Kanjani Eight worked with several songwriters over the course of the album's production such as KenKen of RIZE, Yujin Kitagawa of Yuzu, and Sukimaswitch. They provided their own original material for the solo disc that came with the regular edition.\nCommercially, Fight was a success, debuting at number one on the Oricon and Billboard Japan weekly charts. The album went on to be the twenty-first top sold album of 2011 on the Oricon and twenty-third on the Billboard Japan charts, respectively.\n\n\n== Background and development ==\n\nFor Fight, several songs from the album were penned by top artists in the Japanese songwriting world, such as KenKen of RIZE, Yujin Kitagawa of Yuzu, Sukimaswitch and many others. Shota Yasuda, who is a member of Kanjani Eight, was also given the opportunity to write a song for the album. Takeshi, known for writing several Johnny's songs over the years, again returned to write for this album. Rock'A'Trench also returned from previously working 8Uppers to provide for the album as well.\nAs with their previous albums, Kanjani Eight also worked on their own solo material. For this time around, the solo disc that came with the regular edition of Fight contained two unit songs and two solos. Ryo Nishikido and  Subaru Shibutani wrote the lyrics to their solo pieces, \"Ah\" and \"Scarecrow\", while Nishikido also composed his own music. Shibutani also took charge for a good portion of the song's overall production. Shota Yasuda wrote the lyrics and composed the music for his unit piece with Tadayoshi Ohkura and Shingo Murakami, titled \"Yoru na Yoru na ☆ Yō NIGHT\". Ohkura and Murakami also helped in the production. Ryuhei Maruyama and You Yokoyama were the only two that did not compose anything for their own song but assisted with the production.\nUpon wrapping up production, Fight was announced in September 2011 and song credits were released in October. The album dropped on November 14, 2011, with \"Monjai Beat\" becoming the support track for the album's release.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\nFight follows the same theme as the band's previous album by continuing a mixture of generic Jpop, pop/rock, and R&B styles. While not as mature in sound as their last album, Fight is more upbeat and faster, following the feeling of the excitement of a sports game; which is the album's image theme. The album opens up with \"Monjai Beat\", a fast pop/rock song with Ska influences. You Yokoyama yells, \" Eight! Home run!! \", followed by the rest of band echoing him, setting the entire 'baseball' theme for the album. The song features Tatsuya Nakamura, KenKen (Rize), and Tomoyasu Kamiharako. The second track on the album, \"Uchū ni Ikitta Lion\", slows the pace down just a bit with a standard pop/rock style and uses the falsettos of Ryuhei Maruyama and Shota Yasuda for the repeating, \"Far away\", on the track. The title song and third track off of the album, \"Fight for the Eight\", begins with a rough guitar riff before being joined with a drum beat. Vocally, the song is carried by the harmonies of each member, having them duet within a relative key to each other.\nThe fourth track and first single off the album, \"T.W.L\", is a high paced pop song that is carried by a horn section. The lyrics heavily rely on bilingual word puns, such as, \" Akete meeting you/Hiraku to be loved \" which, when sung, sound like \" Akete mite yo/Hiraku tobira (Try opening it/Open the doors)\". The fifth track, \" Fly High \", is a similar up beat song, and is followed by the album's sixth track and third single, \"365 Nichi Kazoku\", a slow ballad that initially starts off slow but steadily increases as more instruments are added to the overall composition.\nShota Yasuda, one of Kanjani Eight's members, writes and composes \"Dye D?\", the seventh track on the album. The song begins with a generic 80's hook with Ryo Nishikido, Tadayoshi Ohkura and Ryuhei Maruyama singing in English. The song then picks up for the main verse, which is sung in Japanese by Shingo Murakami and Shota Yasuda, before switching back to English for the bridge and chorus, which is carried by Subaru Shibutani. Yasuda continues into the second hook, which then Yokoyama starts the second verse in Japanese, and Nishikido and Ohkura leading into the instrumental in English. The song then promptly changes into a baroque-inspired instrumental break filled with off-beat pauses before suddenly ending and the song returning to its original composition. It continues out till the end with Shibutani repeating the hook and chorus.\nThe second half of the album breaks from the pop/rock theme and switches into a more generic, idol, sound with songs such as: \"Water Drop\", \"Freedom Rion\", and \"Kagayakeru Butai e\". Singles, \"Yellow Pansy Street\", \"Tsubusa ni Koi\", \"My Home\" serve as breaks in-between the album originals before the album closes with the ballad, \"wander\", a lyrically heavy song that is filled emotional encouragement. \" Give me the reason, I want to hold on to it/As I stand in a field I trust/I breath out as I continue on this path/Holding my head up proudly/As beautiful flowers bloom from my footprints/Where to wonder? I want to send true love \", they sing in the final chorus.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThere were barely any critical reviews published once Fight was released due to policies set by Johnny and Associates, but for the reviews out there, they were generally positive. Yamadato Moko of Rooftop commented with, \" Enka, Rock, Pop, Dance Tunes... There are a lot of genres packed into one disc. There's probably a lot of people out there, while noticing this piece, who turn down anything Johnny's and that's understandable, but with the number of artists providing so much to this album, even a person in the livehouse scene would like this (album). \"\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\nFor the Oricon, Fight debuted at number one on the daily album ranking charts, with a total of 143,367 units sold dated November 15, 2011. On the album's fourth day of sales, the Oricon daily ranking charts reported that Fight had sold a total of 227,847 units, surpassing their fourth album, 8Uppers, in first week end-sales and maintaining its number one hold.

The first single released was \"T.W.L/Yellow Pansy Street\", a double A-side single featuring the theme songs for the Crayon Shin-chan movie Crayon Shin-chan: The Storm Called: Operation Golden Spy. The single immediately shot to the top of the Oricon upon release, lasting a total of 17 weeks on the weekly charts. The music videos for the release feature Kanjani Eight singing in front of a green-screened set, interacting with Crayon Shin-chan-inspired caricatures of themselves for \"T.W.L\" and the band performing in a Beatles-inspired get up for \"Yellow Pansy Street\". Following up that release was \"My Home\", released May 11, 2011, and \"365 Nichi Kazoku\", released June 8, 2011, two singles serving as theme songs for the Japanese television dramas Inu wo Kau to Iu koto ~Sky to Waga ga Uchi no 180 Nichi ~ and Umareru. Both singles reached the top spots on the weekly Oricon upon release and remained on the charts for 13 weeks. The music video for \"My Home\" involved Kanjani Eight remodeling a home that they lived in with interspersed scenes of them playing as a band in the completed home.

The song served as the ending theme for the drama, Zenkai Girl. It ranked number one upon release and stayed 9 weeks on the Oricon weekly single charts.

    "text": "Comus are a British progressive folk band who had a brief career in the early 1970s. Their first album, First Utterance, has garnered them a cult following that persists to today. They reunited in 2009, and have played several festivals and released a new album called Out of the Coma.\n\n\n== History ==\nComus was formed in 1969 by art students Roger Wootton and Glenn Goring, who developed their musical style performing in folk clubs in and around Bromley in Kent. The band was named after Comus (a masque by John Milton), and also after the name of the Greek god Comus. The band grew from an early folk duo to a six-piece ensemble; in that later form, David Bowie came to appreciate them. They appeared regularly at his Arts Lab project in Beckenham, Kent. He also invited them to be his support act in a 1969 concert at London's Purcell Rooms.\nTheir first album, First Utterance, with cover art by Wootton and Goring, appeared in 1971. The music is largely acoustic art rock (also described as acoustic metal and acid folk) that blends elements of Eastern percussion, early folk and animal-like vocals. The lyrics involve violence, murder, mental disorder and the mystical. Tiny Mix Tapes rated First Utterance five stars out of five.\nAfter the album, woodwind player Rob Young was replaced by Lindsay Cooper, and the new lineup developed material for a never-released second album. No recording by this lineup would see the light of day for another 40 years. The group disbanded for a time, but Wootton, Andy Hellaby and Bobbie Watson reformed the band with new members for their second album, To Keep from Crying, in 1974.\nA complete box set was released in 2005; this features both studio albums, their only single, \"Diana\", and a previously unreleased track called \"All the Colours of Darkness\". The liner notes feature an exclusive interview with some members of the band. They reformed for the Mellotronen Festival in Sweden in March 2008. They have continued to perform occasional gigs, including some new material.\nOn 13 June 2009, Comus performed for the first time in the UK in 37 years, at the Equinox Festival at Conway Hall.\nA reunion album, Out of the Coma, was released in June 2012. It contains three new tracks: \"Out of the Coma\", \"The Sacrifice\" (both written by Wootton) and \"The Return\" (written by Goring), plus a 1972 live recording of unfinished material from their abandoned follow-up to First Utterance, \"The Malgaard Suite\". Sputnik Music rated Out of the Coma 3.5 out of 5. Louder Sound rated it four stars out of five.\nThe members were active outside Comus.  Wootton also appears on some recordings by Slapp Happy. Cooper went on to join Henry Cow. Reed player Jon Seagroatt is also a member of free-improvising trio Red Square. Colin Pearson went on to produce hits for other artists, including \"Forever Young\" for Alphaville. Seagroatt and singer Bobbie Watson married in 2003.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nIn 1998, Opeth singer and songwriter Mikael Åkerfeldt used part of a sentence from \"Drip Drip\" for the title of the album My Arms, Your Hearse. The full line was \"As I carry you to your grave, my arms your hearse\".\nThe song \"Moonlapse Vertigo\" from Still Life contains the lyric \"Across the leafy pathway,\" which was taken from Comus' \"Diana.\"\nAnother nod to Comus was given on the 2005 Opeth album Ghost Reveries. The second track, \"The Baying of the Hounds\", was derived from a line in the song \"Diana\" which reads, \"And she knows by the sound of the baying, by the baying of the hounds\".\nEnglish experimental band Current 93 covered the song \"Diana\" from First Utterance on their studio album Horsey. Musically, this version differs considerably from the original, with David Tibet singing the lyrics in an agonized fashion and constructing most of the song from a loop based around a vertiginous violin arrangement from the original.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCurrent members\nRoger Wootton – acoustic guitar, lead vocals (1969–1972, 1974, 2008–present)\nGlenn Goring – 6–12 acoustic guitar, electric guitar, slide, hand drums, backing vocals (1969–72, 2008–present)\nAndy Hellaby – Fender bass, slide bass, backing vocals (1969–1972, 1974, 2008–present)\nColin Pearson – violin, viola (1969–72, 2008–present)\nBobbie Watson – lead and backing vocals, percussion (1969–1972, 1974, 2008–present)\nJon Seagroatt – flute, oboe, hand drums (2008–present)\nFormer members\nRob Young – flute, oboe, hand drums (1969–71)\nGordon Coxon – drums (1974)\nKeith Hale – keyboards (1974)\nLindsay Cooper – bassoon (1972, 1974)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nFirst Utterance (1971)\nTo Keep from Crying (1974)\nOut of the Coma (2012)\nLive albums\nEast of Sweden: Live at Melloboat Festival 2008 (2011)\nOut of the Coma (2012) recorded 1972\nBox sets\nSong to Comus: The Complete Collection (2005)\nEPs\n\"Diana / In the Lost Queen's Eyes / Winter is a Coloured Bird\" (1971)\nRoger Wootton solo single\n\"Fiesta Fandango\" / \"New Tide\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nComus at AllMusic\n2010 interview with Roger Wootton on Prog Sphere"

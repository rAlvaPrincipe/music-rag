It is a project maintained by the city of Bogotá and its Secretary Office of Culture, Recreation and Sport. Founded in 1967, it regularly performs at the Concert Halls of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, the Leon de Greiff Auditorium, the Jorge Tadeo Lozano University, the Fabio Lozano Auditorium, the Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Theater, and the Teatro Mayor Julio Mario Santo Domingo.\nThe orchestra currently has the Swedish conductor Joachim Gustafsson as its music director. Former conductors includes the Spanish Josep Caballe-Domenech, the Brazilian conductor Ligia Amadio, the Israeli composer and conductor Lior Shambadal, the New York native conductor Irwin Hoffman, the Chilean conductor Francisco Retting, and two Mexican conductors: Eduardo Diazmuñoz and Enrique Diemecke.\nThe orchestra counts over 100 musicians and over 140 public performances a year. In 2008, it won the Latin Grammy award for Best Instrumental Album in 2008. The orchestra also performed the album 50 Años Tocando Para Ti, which won Rafa Sardina the Latin Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album in 2018.\nIn the city's effort to establish itself as region leader for culture and the arts, the Bogotá Philharmonic extends its functions as classical orchestra to include the promotion and support of multiple music, dance and theater events, including world known Rock al Parque and related series of acts such as Opera al Parque, Jazz al Parque, Hip Hop al Parque, Dance Festivals and Theater Festivals.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Spanish)]"

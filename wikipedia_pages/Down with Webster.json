    "text": "Down with Webster is a Canadian rap rock band from The Beaches area of Toronto who signed with Universal Motown in April 2009. The band first achieved commercial success with the release of the 2009  EP, Time to Win, Vol. I which consisted of the singles \"Rich Girl$\", \"Your Man\" and \"Whoa Is Me\". Their major-label debut album, Time to Win, Vol. II (2011) featured the track \"She's Dope\". The 2014 follow-up album Party for Your Life included the songs \"One in a Million\" and \"Chills.\" The band has been nominated for Juno Awards, MuchMusic Video Awards and Canadian Radio Music Awards.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1998–2007: Career beginnings ===\nDown with Webster originally started as an instrumental jazz band that was formed in a music class at Glen Ames Senior Public School in 1998 by band members Patrick Gillett and Tyler Armes. They, along with the original members of the band, quickly named the group toward the end of class after the beloved titular character from the 80s sitcom Webster, who is played by Emmanuel Lewis. Following a victory at their school's \"Battle of the Bands\" competition, the group was joined by Andrew Martino and Martin \"Bucky\" Seja, students from Cardinal Carter Academy for the Arts, and other members who attended Malvern Collegiate Institute. As a jam band, they made reggae, funk and jazz inspired music in Armes' father garage. Hip-hop elements were incorporated into their music once Seja became a part of the group and rapped along with Gillett, who also brought an influence of blues rock to the band.\nThe band released a six-track CD-R EP titled The Reverb Session July '03. This release was primarily sold at concerts in 2003 and 2004. Hype man Kyle \"Kap\" Fairlie, a former actor whose voice work includes roles in the Nelvana series Redwall, Franklin, Babar and Rolie Polie Olie, and the film The Little Bear Movie, and rapper Cameron \"Cam\" Hunter would later join the band's lineup. In 2007, the band released their debut independent self-titled album.\n\n\n=== 2008–2012: Time to Win, Vol. I & II ===\n\nThe group built a following through their energetic shows. Jill Langlois of Chart recounted their performance at Canadian Music Week in March 2008: \"...the band exploded onto the stage and never slowed down or stopped. Words will never really describe the Down With Webster experience.\" She described them as \"flashy and obnoxious, but fun and loveable\". In June, the group was named 'Best Unsigned Artist in Canada' by Rogers Mobile and received a recording prize worth $25,000. After facing years of rejection, they captured the attention of music executives including musicians Gene Simmons and Timbaland, who wanted to sign the band to their respective record labels. The former had aspirations for them to appear in a reality series to grow their audience as well. According to Timbaland, \"That group is the most amazing and creative, innovative group that's going to come out in 2010.\" Ultimately, they signed with Universal/Motown.\nThe band's debut gold-certified EP Time to Win, Vol. I was released on October 6, 2009. The lead single from the EP \"Rich Girl$\", which sampled the Hall & Oates track of the same name, peaked at No. 21 on the Canadian Hot 100. In the fall of 2009, they opened for Forever the Sickest Kids on the Cheap Date Tour. \nThe follow-up single \"Your Man\" peaked at No. 12 on the Hot 100, and was certified double platinum in digital downloads by the CRIA.

The tour was completed on November 24, 2010, at Albuquerque, New Mexico. They then performed at the pregame show for the 98th Grey Cup.

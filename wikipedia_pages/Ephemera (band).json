    "text": "Ephemera is a Norwegian pop trio from Bergen. Formed in 1994, it consists of Christine Sandtorv, Inger-Lise Størksen and Jannicke Larsen.\n\n\n== History ==\nTheir first album, Glue, was released in 1996.\nAfter several years of touring, studying music, and writing new songs, a second album, Sun, was released in 2000. That album earned the band a Best Group nomination in the Spellemannprisen awards, Norway's equivalent of the Grammy Awards.\nThree more albums were released across the next five years, and the band won the Spellemannprisen award in the category Best Pop Album for the album Balloons and Champagne (2002) and Air (2003).\nThe band was an essential part of the defining \"Bergensbølgen\"\n(The Bergen Wave) that heavily influenced Norwegian music and paved the way for a new international recognition of Norwegian music and up and coming artists. Ephemera earned a solid fan base in Northern Europe and in Asia, and they have been an immense inspiration for new Norwegian artists now seen on stages in Norway and around the world. Their music is also found in films, commercials and TV-series.\nThe band took a break in 2005 after extensive touring. The break however, was extended several times to give room for new professional careers and solo albums, in addition to family extensions. After two fully booked concerts in Oslo and Bergen in 2015 and 2016, the break finally seemed to reach an end. \nSince 2017 they have spent time in studio with their long-time producer Yngve Saetre, and in June 2019 they released their new single MAGIC – the first taste of their new compositions.\n\n\n=== Members ===\nChristine Sandtorv – vocal, guitar, keyboards, songwriter\nJannicke Larsen – vocal, guitar, keyboards, percussion, songwriter\nInger Lise Størksen – vocal, percussion, chimes, songwriter\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nThe Alarm Music Prize (2003)\nSpellemannprisen nominations (Best Pop Album for Sun in 2001, Balloons and Champagne in 2003)\n\n\n=== Discography ===\n1996: Glue\n2000: Sun\n2001: Balloons and Champagne\n2003: Air\n2005: Monolove\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of all-female bands\nList of alternative-rock bands\nList of Norwegian musicians\nMusic of Norway\n\n\n== External links ==\nephemera.no, the band's official website\nEphemera at AllMusic\nKaasen, Anders (undated).  \"Ephemera: Biography\".

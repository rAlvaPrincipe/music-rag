Tchort), the remaining members formed In the Woods... The band released a demo in 1993 called The Isle of Men, as well as a full-length album named Heart of the Ages in 1995. The following, Omnio, had lengthy songs with more female vocals. Their third album was Strange in Stereo.\nIn 2000, In the Woods... released the album Three Times Seven on a Pilgrimage, a compilation of three of their previous 7\" featuring covers from Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane and King Crimson, together with some newly released and rebuilt songs, like the new version of Child of Universal Tongue.\nAfter releasing Three Times Seven on a Pilgrimage, the band held a farewell performance in their home town of Kristiansand which featured all musicians, including the former members. The performance was recorded and released as Live at the Caledonien Hall in 2003. Some of the members went on to play in the similarly-styled band Green Carnation, others took up personal projects and founded the independent label Karmakosmetix Records, created to support new experimental bands such as In the Woods... was in its time.\nThe band's founding guitarist Oddvar A.M., born Oddvar Moi, died on May 13, 2013.\nAnders Kobro announced the reformation of the band's core lineup (Kobro, X.

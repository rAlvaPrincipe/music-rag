They began to work on their own material at Karmil's home studio in London. Ford was singing, then Karmil's girlfriend Lolita Moon (Neneh and Cameron's daughter Tyson) was asked to sing on some tracks. Eventually Neneh Cherry joined the team and performed rapped/sung vocals. Ford and Karmil convinced Cherry to move to Sweden and the band settled in Cherry's country house near Malm√∂ and recorded their first album Laylow, released in 2006. They are currently based between Stockholm and London.\nLaylow received negative reviews from the BBC, stating it as \"mostly uninspired and smoothed to an unpleasant sheen.\"\nThe group released a second album, Medicine, in France in March 2009.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n== Instruments used on stage ==\nBurt plays: Novation X-Station and Kaoss Pad 2\nLolita plays: Roland V-Synth (with its D-Beam system that allows her to control some parameters with her hand) and Akai MPC\nKarmil plays: Blueridge sunburst dreadnought acoustic guitar (Contemporary Series), Gibson Les Paul standard and a Patrick Eggle Berlin Pro V.\nBoth guitar and bass use line 6 pods.\nAbleton Live is used to run triggered drum loops and samples\n\n\n== See also ==\nNeneh Cherry discography\n\n\n== External links ==\nCirKus on Myspace\n\n\n== References =="

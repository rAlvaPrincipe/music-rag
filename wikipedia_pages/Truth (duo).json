    "text": "Truth is the stage name of the Christchurch, New Zealand dubstep duo composed of Andre Fernandez and Tristan Roake. \nTruth have made significant strides in the dubstep scene since their formation in 2007, gaining recognition for their signature deep, dark, and heavy sound characterized by intricate basslines and powerful drops. Their music often blends influences from dub, reggae, drum & bass and hip-hop.\nTruth are known for their live performances & DJing, and have toured extensively since the mid-2000s, including numerous tours of North America, UK/EU & NZ/AUS, a tour of Latin America, and marquee festivals all around the world including Shambhala, Outlook, Electric Forest, Boomtown, Earth Frequency, Rabbits Eat Lettuce and more.\nNow based in Portland, Oregon and Christchurch, NZ, Truth remain active in the global dubstep circuit, regularly performing and releasing new music, continuing to evolve their sound while staying true to their deep roots in the genre.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Establishment and Early Years (2007-2010) ===\nInitial Breakthrough: Truth emerged onto the international dubstep scene in late 2007, when Mala of Digital Mystikz signed their debut single The Fatman / Stolen Children, and released it in 2009 on his prestigious label, DEEP MEDi Musik. Described by Boomkat as \"dark and immaculately executed”, the single (released as MEDi13x on 12\" vinyl format.) established their reputation for producing dark, heavy, and meticulously crafted bass music.\nEarly Beginning: Following their initial success, Truth went on to release several EPs and singles that further solidified their standing within the dubstep world. Notable early tracks include The Future, Terror Planet, Amnesia, Wednesday, Stay, International, Revelation, Timeshift, and Hackerz to name a few. \nDebut Album: In September 2010, Truth released their debut album, Puppets, through Sydney-based Aquatic Lab Records. The album received widespread critical acclaim, including a nomination for Best Dubstep Album at the 2011 DubstepForum Awards. Puppets was praised for its authentic dubstep sound, with reviews from outlets like Knowledge Magazine, who lauded the album for its representation of \"dubstep in its purest form\" and characterized it as \"spacious, sub-heavy and forward-thinking\". Music Week described it as \"an expansive listen that works as well on headphones as in a club\"., while The New Zealand Herald branded Puppets \"sinister yet soulful\" praising its \"beautifully brutal bass-laden beats\".\nIn April 2011, Truth released a New Zealand-only double-CD version of Puppets. It included a bonus disc of remixes, previously unreleased material and a 35-minute mix of music from the album. The group stated that all proceeds from sales would go directly to charities involved with rebuilding Christchurch following the earthquake of February 2011.\nIn early 2011, Julian Van Auden left the group and now performs solo under the moniker Gamble.\n\n\n=== Expanding Influence and Discography (2011-2016) ===\nThe period between 2011 and 2016 was pivotal for Truth, as it marked a time of significant growth, both in terms of their music releases & touring - as well as the birth of their label. The duo cemented their reputation as key figures in the genre, and their work during these years has had a lasting impact on both their career and the broader bass music landscape. \nSophomore Album: Following debut album Puppets in 2010, Truth released their second full-length album Love’s Shadow in 2012. \nSingles and EP's: During this period, Truth released a series of singles and EPs that maintained their presence & momentum in the scene. Notable releases include:\n\nThe Emperor (2011): Released on N-Type's Wheel & Deal Records.\nRedlight (2012): Released on J:Kenzo's seminal Artikal Music imprint.\nDevil’s Hands EP (2013): Released on iconic dubstep label Tempa, Devil’s Hand was a standout track that emphasized Truth’s mastery of dark, brooding dubstep, and quickly became a key release in their catalog. Seeing broader commercial success, Devil's Hands went on to be featured in cable network FX's wildly successful American Horror Story series.\n30,000 Ft EP (2014): Released on Mala's Deep Medi Musik label.\nHow Strange EP (2014): Released on Tempa Recordings, the EP presented some of Truth's most haunting offerings, with title track How Strange opening with eerie, ethereal vocals layered over dark, brooding sub-bass. Hypnotic, haunting atmosphere.\nUndeniable EP (2014): Undeniable was the debut EP on Truth's newly formed label, Deep, Dark & Dangerous, marking the beginning of a new chapter in their career as label heads. The EP showcased their signature deep, atmospheric sound, blending minimalistic production with heavy basslines. The immersive, subtle nature of Undeniable helped set the tone for the label, which would go on to become a prominent platform for dark, experimental dubstep.\nThe Ark EP (2015): Released in 2015 on Firepower Records, this EP represented a unique blend of Truth's deep dubstep sound with broader musical experimentation. The EP received critical acclaim for its ability to balance dark, atmospheric dubstep with more diverse influences, such as house and beat-driven tracks. VICE's THUMP commented, that “Berlin,” for example, is an Ibiza-ready house tune, whereas “Come to Mind” featuring Lelijveld is a beat scene classic that wouldn’t seem out of sorts at Low End Theory.\nDevils Game EP (2015): Released on their own Deep, Dark & Dangerous label imprint, this EP further explored their signature dark and minimal sound.\n\n\n==== Deep, Dark & Dangerous Label ====\nIn 2014, Truth established the record label Deep, Dark & Dangerous. The label primarily includes dubstep artists and releases.\n\n\n=== Growth and Continued Evolution (2017-Present) ===\nAs of 2024, Truth remains an active force in dubstep, both as artists and curators of their label. They continue to tour internationally, release new music, and support long-standing & emerging talent through DDD. Their legacy in the dubstep community is well-established, with a reputation for consistency, innovation, and dedication to the genre.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nTruth discography at Discogs"

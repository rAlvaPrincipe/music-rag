    "text": "Shredders is an American hip hop group from Minneapolis, Minnesota. It consists of rappers P.O.S and Sims and producers Lazerbeak and Paper Tiger. The four are part of the Doomtree collective. The group's debut studio album, Dangerous Jumps, peaked at number 43 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt the end of the tour for All Hands in 2015, Minneapolis hip hop collective Doomtree decided to take a short break, allowing each member to focus on their own projects. P.O.S, Sims, Lazerbeak, and Paper Tiger, who are four-sevenths of the collective, formed the group Shredders in 2016. Producers Lazerbeak and Paper Tiger started trading tracks between New York and Minneapolis. Around tour dates for their respective solo albums, rappers P.O.S and Sims took hold of those beats and started trading verses over them.\nIn 2017, Shredders released a self-titled debut EP. It was followed by the singles \"Xanthrax\" and \"Flipping Cars\". In that year, the group released the debut studio album, Dangerous Jumps. It peaked at number 43 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart.\nIn 2019, the group released the singles \"Ayeyayaya\", \"Suburban Base\", and \"Vanilla ISIS\". In that year, the group also released a studio album, Great Hits.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nDangerous Jumps (2017)\nGreat Hits (2019)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nShredders (2017)\nClose Cuts (2024)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Xanthrax\" (2017)\n\"Flipping Cars\" (2017)\n\"Ayeyayaya\" (2019)\n\"Suburban Base\" (2019)\n\"Vanilla ISIS\" (2019)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nShredders at AllMusic"

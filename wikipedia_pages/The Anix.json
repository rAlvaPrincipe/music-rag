The band made various albums along the first two years of their existence (A Division of You, Digital Rock etc.) but they didn't receive much recognition. The band released their debut album, titled \"An Illusion of Time\" in 2004. The band's first label released album was \"Play, Dance, Repeat\" released in April 2005. The band then underwent multiple lineup changes before entering the studio in 2006 to record their next album.\n\n\n=== Gaining recognition with \"Demolition City\" and release of \"Sleepwalker\" and \"Ephemeral\" (2008–2017) ===\nThe Anix's first critically acclaimed album was \"Demolition City\". The album was released in 2008 under Chamberlain records. A review was published about the album on Billboard Magazine's vol.120 no.22 issue.

Along with Apoptygma Berzerk, the band played various live shows in Germany.\nThe band then signed with Cleopatra Records and released their next album - \"Sleepwalker\". Released in 2011, the album received praise in the gaming community. The song \"Warning Signs\" was included in the soundtrack of Mass Effect: Paragon Lost. Smith said that the band is often inspired by film adaptations of graphic novels, like The Dark Knight and Sin City. They embarked on a North American tour with Cromwell in 2012.\nThe band's next album \"Ephemeral\" was released in 2017. The album contained elements from techno and dance music; a first for the band.\n\n\n=== Turning into a solo project and subsequent releases (2018–present) ===\n\nAfter the release of \"Ephemeral\" the band turned into a solo project with Brandon remaining the sole band member. He signed with electronic music label FiXT and released his debut single \"Fight the Future\".

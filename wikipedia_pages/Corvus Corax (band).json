    "text": "Corvus Corax is a German band known for playing neo-Medieval music using authentic instruments. Their name is the Latin name for the common raven. The band was formed in 1989 by Castus Rabensang, Wim (Venustus) and Meister Selbfried (\"Master Selfpeace\") in East Germany. The band often uses bagpipes as the solo instrument; their live performances attract attention with the bizarre look of the musicians being reminiscent of ancient Greek myths: half-naked, dressed in unusual clothes, wearing primitive tribal decorations, often tattooed.\nToday the band consists of seven members: Castus Rabensang (\"Castus Ravensong\"), Xandru, Norri (formerly known as Harmann der Drescher), Hatz (\"Hunt\"), Vit and Victorius. In May 2005 Meister Selbfried, one of the Corvus Corax founders and the researcher of medieval music, decided to cease his active musicianship and to dedicate himself mostly to managing Corvus Corax's own label Pica Records. His place in the line-up was taken by Jordon Finus in 2006.\nThe band releases its music through Pica Records in Europe and Noir Records in the US. The Cantus Buranus projects have thus far been released in Europe by Roadrunner Europe.\n\n\n== Interpretation and theory ==\nBecause medieval music theory was dominated by ecclesiastics, it is often difficult to determine from the existing manuscripts just how the secular medieval music sounded. Corvus Corax draws on a number of sources to try to make their music as authentic as possible: they have used documents that \"condemn profane music\" as an indicator of what the music might have sounded like, and drawn on nineteenth century scholarly treatises for information. In many cases these treatises are unreliable, as they impart more nineteenth century interpretations of medieval music than factual information on what the music was like.\nBut the profane music of the day was often accompanied by a droning bass tone similar to that generated by the bourdon stop on an organ,  which is provided in Corvus Corax's case by the drones on their bagpipes. An inkling as to the harmonies used is found in a song by Walter von der Vogelweide, in which he calls for the song to be played \"the old way\", meaning harmonising with thirds. At the time, the third was considered an awkward, ugly interval by the sacred musician—like the tritone, or diabolus in musica—but it was a common interval in folk music.\nMatters are further complicated by the fact that each minstrel would add his personal interpretation to a piece, and that recorded (i.e. written) versions may differ depending on who did the transcribing, and where. It is on this that Corvus Corax's interpretation hinges: medieval popular music was played more from the heart than the brain, and despite making use of scholarship to give them a grounding, Corvus Corax attempts to maintain the spirited, free manner in which the minstrels themselves would have played the music.\n\n\n== Projects ==\n\nIn 1996 the band released the album Tanzwut which combined the elements of metal music with their brand sound of bagpipes. The CD turned out to be a commercially successful experiment and the band decided to continue the tradition of that album in a separate musical project called Tanzwut, which included Castus Rabensang (German Rabensang = ravensong), Wim, and Teufel (German Teufel = Devil) from Corvus Corax as well as three new members.\n\nIn 2005 Corvus Corax started the ambitious project Cantus Buranus: a full-length opera set to the original Carmina Burana manuscript lyrics. The music for the opera was fully composed by the band and had no connection with the famous work by Carl Orff. It was performed with symphonic orchestra, choir and medieval ensemble, combining traditional symphonism with medieval minstrel-like melodies. The project included a CD recording, a DVD, as well as live performances. A live CD and DVD recording of Cantus Buranus was released in March 2006.\n2005 also marked the band's debut concerts in the US. The band performed four sets on each of four different days in mid-October, not far from Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire. There was also a \"secret show\" held for employees of the Faire. Footage shot by the band members and crew was assembled into a featurette that was included as a bonus track on the US edition of the band's live DVD, Gaudia Vite.\nOut on 1 August 2008 via the band owned label Pica Music, Cantus Buranus II was released., It is a new orchestral recording of songs from the Medieval manuscript \"Carmina Burana\". The Berlin-based act created a composition for orchestra, choir and a Medieval ensemble and recorded the CD and DVD live in the Museum Island in front of 5,000 people.\nA collaboration with the Russian band Ottawa Yo appeared on YouTube on December 31, 2022.\nCorvus Corax performed a live rendition of their song \"Ballade De Mercy\" in the pilot episode of the TV series Game of Thrones, based on the fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. The pilot episode was changed dramatically before it aired on TV, and the performance was not used.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nAnte Casu Peccati (1989)\nCongregatio (1990)\nInter Deum Et Diabolum Semper Musica Est (1993)\nTritonus (1995)\nLive auf dem Wäscherschloß (1998)\nViator (1998)\nTempi Antiquii (1999, compilation of works from 1988 to 1992)\nMille Anni Passi Sunt (2000 – limited edition of 2000 copies issued as 'MM')\nIn Electronica Remixe (2000)\nSeikilos (2002)\nGaudia Vite (live) (2003)\nBest of Corvus Corax (2005)\nCantus Buranus (2005)\nCantus Buranus Live in Berlin (2006)\nVenus Vina Musica (2006)\nKaltenberg anno MMVII (2007)\nCantus Buranus II (released on 1 August 2008.)\nCantus Buranus – Das Orgelwerk (released on 5 December 2008)\nLive in Berlin (released in July 2009)\nSverker (2011)\nSverker Live at Summer Breeze & Castlefest (2011)\nGimlie (2013)\nArs Mystica – Selectio 1989–2016 (2016)\nDer Fluch des Drachen (2017)\nSkál (2018)\nDie Maske des Roten Todes (2021)\n Era Metallum (2022)\n\n\n=== EPs/Singles ===\nTanzwut EP (1996)\nCorvus Corax erzählen Märchen aus alter Zeit EP (2000)\nHymnus Cantica CDS (2002)\n\n\n=== DVD/Video ===\nGaudia Vite Live DVD – USA Edition (2006)\nCantus Buranus Live in Berlin DVD (2006)\nCorvus Corax Live in Berlin – Passionskirche DVD (2009)\nCantus Buranus Live in München DVD (2010)\n\n\n== See also ==\nIn Extremo\nTanzwut\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCorvus Corax official website\nTanzwut official website"

They released two albums with mixed success; their debut single was \"Maybe I Love You.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nBoth Yuri and Chae Rina have previously been part of major Korean pop groups: Yuri in Cool, and Chae in Roo'ra and Diva.  They became friends in the 1990s while performing with their respective groups, and discussed doing a joint project for 10 years.

Described as an R&B album, the duo mentioned that it was an album made with no regrets, and they put their best efforts into making a great album.

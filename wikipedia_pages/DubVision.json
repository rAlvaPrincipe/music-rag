    "text": "DubVision is a Dutch DJ duo from The Hague consisting of brothers Victor (born 1989) and Stephan Leicher (born 1981) signed to the labels Spinnin' Records, Armada Music, STMPD RCRDS and Axtone.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nStephan and Victor's parents pressured the duo to learn to play an instrument during their childhood, so they learned to play the piano at age 7. They grew up in several countries, where they grew to appreciate musical influences from different cultures. At a later age, Victor began experimenting with electronic music, using different computer programs. After seeing his younger brother producing, Steve became interested, and the two decided to team up as a group.\nIn 2012, DubVision collaborated with Project 46 on the song \"You & I\", which they released on Spinnin' Records. That same year, they also made their debut on Axtone Records with their rendition of \"Committed To Sparkle Motion\" by Discopolis. They released \"Redux\" through Spinnin' to start off 2013, and, later that year, also made their debut on Doorn Records with their track \"Into the Light\", in which they collaborated with Sander van Doorn. In 2014, they released \"Backlash\" on Spinnin' Records, which marked their first Beatport #1 overall chart track. DubVision also performed at the 2014 edition of Tomorrowland for the first time in Belgium. They then remixed \"Gold Skies\" by Sander van Doorn and Martin Garrix for their next release on Spinnin' Records. They collaborated with Feenixpawl for \"Destination\", their sophomore track on Axtone, for their next release. For their final track of the year, they put out the single \"Turn It Around,\" through Spinnin' Records as well.\nIn 2018, DubVision and Firebeatz formed the supergroup METAFO4R, performing for the first time together at EDC Las Vegas 2018.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio Albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As METAFO4R (with Firebeatz) ====\n\nCo Produced:\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n2010\nC-Jay and Shylock — \"Watch Closely\" (DubVision Remix)\nJon Kong — \"Elevate\" (DubVision Remix)\n2011\nGlitter — \"Tageskarte\" (DubVision Remix)\nDerek Howell — \"Stride\" (DubVision Remix)\nHyline and Jaybeetrax — \"Disturb\" (DubVision Remix)\nEddie Middle-Line — \"Sunset Feel\" (DubVision Remix)\nDJ BeCha — \"Goodbye\" (DubVision Remix)\n2012\nDark Matters (featuring Jess Morgan) — \"The Real You\" (DubVision Remix)\nSyke 'n' Sugarstarr and Jay Sebag — \"Like That Sound\" (DubVision Remix)\nDerek Howell — \"Stride\" (DubVision Remix)\nPascal & Pearce (featuring Juliet Harding) — \"Disco Sun\" (DubVision Remix)\nDiscopolis — \"Falling (Committed To Sparkle Motion)\" (DubVision Remix)\n2013\nRoyaal & Venuto — \"Summertime\" (DubVision Remix)\n2014\nIcona Pop — \"Just Another Night\" (DubVision Remix)\nDimitri Vegas & Like Mike — \"Chattahoochee\" (DubVision Remix)\nFoster the People — \"Coming of Age\" (DubVision Remix)\nSander van Doorn, Martin Garrix and DVBBS — \"Gold Skies\" (DubVision Remix)\n2015\nDirty South (featuring Sam Martin) — \"Unbreakable\" (DubVision Remix)\n2016\nNervo (featuring Harrison Miya) — \"Bulletproof\" (DubVision Remix)\nKris Menace and Life Like — \"Discopolis\" (DubVision Remix)\nFais (featuring Afrojack) — \"Hey\" (DubVision Remix)\nThe Chainsmokers (featuring Charlee) — \"Inside Out\" (DubVision Remix)\nAxwell & Ingrosso — \"Thinking About You\" (DubVision Remix)\n2017\nMartin Garrix and Dua Lipa — \"Scared to Be Lonely\" (DubVision Remix)\nArmin van Buuren and Garibay (featuring Olaf Blackwood) — \"I Need You\" (DubVision Remix)\nAfrojack and David Guetta (featuring Ester Dean) — \"Another Life\" (DubVision Remix)\n2018\nMartin Garrix (featuring Khalid) — \"Ocean\" (DubVision Remix)\n2019\nSyzz and Taku-Hero — \"Be My Love\" (DubVision Remix)\nHardwell (featuring Trevor Guthrie) — \"Summer Air\" (DubVision Remix)\nMartin Garrix featuring Bonn — \"No Sleep\" (Dubvision Remix)\n2020\nAfrojack featuring Ally Brooke — \"All Night\" (DubVision Remix)\nTritonal and Brooke Williams — \"Someone To Love You\" (DubVision Remix)\nMartin Garrix (featuring John Martin) — \"Higher Ground\" (DubVision Remix)\nGATTÜSO & Disco Killerz - I'll Be The One (DubVision Remix)\n2021\nAndrew Rayel — \"Silver Lining\" (DubVision Remix)\nAfrojack and David Guetta — \"Hero\" (DubVision Remix)\n2022\n\nEir Aoi - \"Heart\" (DubVision Remix)\nFrank Walker, Two Feet - \"Day by Day\" (DubVision Remix)\nMartin Garrix & JVKE - \"Hero\" (DubVision Remix)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

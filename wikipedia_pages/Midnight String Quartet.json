    "text": "The Midnight String Quartet were an easy listening chamber music quartet, consisting of two violins, a viola, and a cello, made up of students (at the time) or graduates from the University of Southern California. They played covers and standards over several albums from 1966 to the early seventies, supplemented by a professional rhythm section, often including bass, drums and guitar and sometimes piano and harpsichord.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Midnight String Quartet made a series of instrumental recordings produced by \"Tommy 'Snuff' Garrett\", on  Viva Records (U.S.), a subsidiary of Snuff Garrett Records.\nTheir First album, Rhapsodies for Young Lovers (1966) was arranged by Leon Russell and spent 59 weeks in the Billboard charts peaking at number 17 in November 1966.

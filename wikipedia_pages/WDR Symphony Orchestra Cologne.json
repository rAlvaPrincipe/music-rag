    "text": "The WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne (German: WDR Sinfonieorchester Köln) is a German radio orchestra based in Cologne, where the orchestra mainly performs at two concert halls: the WDR Funkhaus Wallrafplatz and the Kölner Philharmonie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe orchestra was founded in 1947 by Allied occupation authorities after World War II, as the orchestra of Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR; Northwest German Radio), with the name Kölner Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester (Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra). The orchestra became particularly known for its performances of 20th-century and contemporary music. It has commissioned and premiered works from such composers as Luciano Berio, Hans Werner Henze, Mauricio Kagel, Krzysztof Penderecki, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Bernd Alois Zimmermann. \nFor the first part of its history, the orchestra did not have a principal conductor, but worked with guest conductors. Christoph von Dohnányi was the first conductor to serve as the orchestra's principal conductor, from 1964 to 1969. In the 1990s, the orchestra changed its name to the WDR Sinfonieorchester (WDR Symphony Orchestra).\nIn February 2017, Cristian Măcelaru first guest-conducted the orchestra. He returned for three subsequent guest appearances with the orchestra. In May 2019, the orchestra announced the appointment of Măcelaru as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2019–2020 season, with an initial contract of 3 years. In June 2020, the orchestra announced an extension of Măcelaru's contract through July 2025.  In October 2023, the orchestra announced that Măcelaru is to stand down as its chief conductor at the close of the 2024–2025 season, and to take the title of Artistic Partner for the 2025–2026 season.\nIn December 2022, Marie Jacquot first guest-conducted the orchestra.  In January 2024, the orchestra announced the appointment of Jacquot as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2026–2027 season, with an initial contract of 4 years.  Jacquot is the first female conductor to be named chief conductor of the WDR Sinfonieorchester Köln.\nThe orchestra has recorded commercially for such labels as Avie, Hänssler, Kairos, CPO, and Wergo.\n\n\n== Principal conductors ==\nChristoph von Dohnányi (1964–1969)\nZdeněk Mácal (1970–1974)\nHiroshi Wakasugi (1977–1983)\nGary Bertini (1983–1991)\nHans Vonk (1991–1997)\nSemyon Bychkov (1997–2010)\nJukka-Pekka Saraste (2010–2019)\nCristian Măcelaru (2019–present)\nMarie Jacquot (designate, effective 2026)\n\n\n== Venues ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nStudio for Electronic Music (WDR)\nWDR Funkhausorchester\nWDR Big Band\nWDR Rundfunkchor Köln\nRadio orchestra\nCategory:Music commissioned by the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne (1)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to WDR Sinfonieorchester Köln at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website (in German)"

There, he started learning the guitar, finding inspiration through jazz classics.\nAlso Parisian, Yann Destagnol learned to play flute and clarinet when he was a small child. As he aged he became deeply influenced by the Beatles, the Beach Boys, David Bowie and other pop acts. He started to play drums by emulating them. He also learned to play the piano and the guitar. He later bought himself a four-track recording machine and started songwriting and singing. Fascinated more by voices than by charismatic band leaders, he liked bands such as Aerosmith, The Police and Queen and later became a great fan of R&B divas.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of one-hit wonders in the United States\nList of Billboard number-one dance club songs\nList of artists who reached number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nYann Destagnol (Yann Destal) Twitter"

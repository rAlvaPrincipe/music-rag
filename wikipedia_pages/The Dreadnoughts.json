    "text": "The Dreadnoughts are a Canadian 6-piece folk punk band from Vancouver. The band combines a wide range of European folk music with modern street punk.  The band has seven full-length albums and three EPs on various labels, and has played around 500 shows in around 30 countries. They also used to perform before 2020 as a traditional polka band at polka festivals, under the name \"Polka Time!\". Their performance peak was in 2010, when 180 shows were played.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Dreadnoughts formed in 2006 in the Downtown Eastside area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. They released their first album, Legends Never Die, in 2007, followed by their second album, Victory Square, in 2009. They wrote Victory Square as a tribute to their home city of Vancouver, and as such, many of the songs on the album focus on places of importance to the bandmembers. The Dreadnoughts promoted the album by touring all over Canada and Europe in 2009, a tour which inspired much of the material on their 2010 album Polka's Not Dead. The tour was documented in a book by Adam PW Smith, who would later produce a mini-documentary about the band as well.\nIn late 2011, after producing Polka's Not Dead, the band announced an indefinite hiatus. However, they followed this by playing shows occasionally, such as annual Vancouver shows, a two-week European tour in January 2014, and two March gigs with Guttermouth in 2014. On November 11, 2017 they released their fourth full-length album Foreign Skies, a folk-punk concept album about the First World War. They followed this up with the acoustic album Into The North on November 15, 2019. Their most recent album Green Willow, which consists entirely of folk-punk renditions of traditional folk songs (with the exception of the final track \"Roll Northumbria\"), was released digital-only on March 13, 2023. On December 8th, 2024, the band announced a new, unnamed album in the works, being \"polka-heavy and shanty-heavy.\"\n\n\n== Sound and influences ==\nNoticeable influences in their sound include acts such as The Pogues, Brave Combo, Stan Rogers, Boiled in Lead, Gogol Bordello, Goran Bregovic, Dropkick Murphys, and Rancid. The band commonly records and perform sea shanties, polkas and klezmer songs, and are also strongly influenced by English Scrumpy and Western music - in particular the West Country bands The Wurzels and the Surfin' Turnips.\nTheir 2009 release, Victory Square, was ranked the 4th-best folk-punk release of 2009 by folk-punk magazine Shite N' Onions. Their previous release, Legends Never Die, was ranked #7 on the magazine's 2008 list. Multiple cross-Canada tours and European tours have helped to contribute to the band's steadily rising profile.\nOther acts that have shared the stage with The Dreadnoughts include Stiff Little Fingers, The Cider Fecks, Swingin' Utters, Hepcat, The Real McKenzies, Goran Bregovic, IAMX, Okean Elzy, Talco, The Creepshow, Mad Sin, and Los Furios.\n\n\n== Current members ==\n\n\n=== Recording members ===\nNicolas Smyth- “Dad” (Formerly known as “The Fang” and “Uncle Touchy”), Guitar and vocals\nKyle Taylor - “Leroy ‘Slow Ride’ McBride” (formerly known as “Seamus O’Flanahan” and “The Best Fiddle in the West”), Accordion and fiddle\nConrad Shynkar - “Steve”, Mandolin\nAndrew Hay - “Squid Vicious”, Bass\nMarco Bieri - “The Stupid Swedish Bastard”, Drums\n\n\n=== Touring members ===\nJames Battle - “Jungle Jim”, Mandolin\nPaul Carrigan - “Pauly Shoreman”, Accordion\nLou Johnson - “King Louie”, Fiddle\nEnrique Soteldo - \"Kiké\", Drums\nBrandon Malave - \"Mr. Cream\", Bass\nAled Jenkins- “Karen” (Formerly known as ”Fuzznuts”), Mandolin (Recording Member for Roll and Go) (formerly of Smokey Bastard)\nMomo, Fiddle\nMike Wood - “Cumulo Dingus”, Bass (formerly of Smokey Bastard)\nSean McNab - “Potato Man”, Bass (also of The Creepshow)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nWilliam Shand - “Fire Marshall Willy”, Bass (formerly of The Brass Action)\n“The Wicked Wench of the West”, Bass\nCalliandra Sexmith - “The Dread Pirate Druzil\" / “Bouzouki Joe”, Mandolin, Irish bouzouki, tenor banjo, whistle\nTegan Ceschi-Smith - “Wormley Wangersnitch”, Fiddle\nElise, Fiddle\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nLegends Never Die – July 2007 (Golden Tee Records)\nVictory Square -  June 2009 (Stomp Records)\nPolka's Not Dead - October 2010 (Stomp Records)\nForeign Skies  - November 2017 (Self Released)\nInto The North - November 2019 (Stomp Records)\nRoll And Go - June 2022 (Stomp Records)\nGreen Willow - March 2023 (Digital-Only, Self Released)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nCyder Punks Unite - July 2010, (Leech Redda)\nUncle Touchy Goes To College - July 2011 (Bellydrop Records)\nForeign Skies (B Sides) - January 2018 (Self Released)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bands from Canada\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStomp Records Page\nFacebook Page\nMyspace Page\nBandcamp Page\nOfficial website\n2011 Mini-Documentary Film\nPolka Never Dies Video shot in Poland during the 2011 European Tour"

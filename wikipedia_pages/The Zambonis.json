    "text": "The Zambonis are an American indie rock band formed in 1991 by musicians Dave Schneider (The LeeVees), Peter Katis, Jon Aley, and Tarquin Katis, based in Connecticut. The Zambonis write songs exclusively about ice hockey.  Schneider says of the band's musical style: “We’re the only band in the world whose two biggest influences are The Beatles and Wayne Gretzky!”\nThe NHL has commissioned the group to compose theme songs for the Boston Bruins and the Colorado Avalanche. The band has toured with the Stanley Cup and fundraised for Matt Cullen's organization, Cullen Children's Foundation.\nIn deference to the ice resurfacer and Frank Zamboni, The Zambonis are a licensee of the Zamboni Company.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Zambonis debut album, 100% Hockey...and Other Stuff, was recorded at Tarquin Studios in Connecticut, USA and was released in 1996.

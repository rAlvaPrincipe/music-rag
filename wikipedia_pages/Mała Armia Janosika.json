    "text": "Mała Armia Janosika is a Polish music band and artistic group, which performs folk music inspired by the culture of Podhale. It was formed in 2015 on the initiative o Damian Pałasz, a violinist from Raba Wyżna.\nMała Armia Janosika consists of two hundred and sixty members (ranging in age from two to seventy years old) and is the largest Goral band in Poland. The group brings together children and youth from Raba Wyżna and its surroundings, united by a shared passion for regional music and the traditions of the Podhale region. The band's headquarters are in Raba Wyżna, where rehearsals and preparations for artistic performances occur regularly. In 2018, the Mała Armia Janosika was invited to participate in the ceremonial Concert for Independence (Polish: Koncert dla Niepodległej).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Band name and lineup ===\nThe name of the group is a play on words: the oxymoron \"Mała Armia\" (Little Army) is used to refer to the size of the band, which is predominantly made up of children, while the word \"Janosik\" (a legendary Carpathian bandit) is meant to evoke associations with mountain folklore. The band regularly goes on concert tours, performing throughout Poland and participating in events of a folk, holiday, papal, and patriotic nature.\nIn 2019, a musical section joined Mała Armia Janosika, forming an instrumental ensemble consisting of:\n\nRafał \"Piętaszek\" Nowak – keyboards, accordion\nWojtek Czyrnek – electric and acoustic guitar\nMariusz Pacyga – bass guitar\nGrzegorz Jaromin – percussion instruments\n\n\n=== 2015–2017 ===\nOn March 15, 2015, the first recruitment for the band was announced, which initially operated under the name \"Galicja Projekt\". Twenty-five people living in Raba Wyżna and its surroundings applied for the project. After the recruitment period, all members began their first lessons in playing the violin and Podhale basses under the guidance of Damian Pałasz. On December 24, 2015, the band initiated the tradition of \"Pasterki Góralskie\" in the parish church in Raba Wyżna.\nIn January 2016, the band organized charity caroling concerts for the sick and poor, and in July, they produced a music video for the song \"Siła jest w jedności\" (English: \"Strength is in Unity\"), recorded for World Youth Days.

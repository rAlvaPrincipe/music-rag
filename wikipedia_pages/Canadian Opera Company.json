    "text": "The Canadian Opera Company (COC) is an opera company in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the largest opera company in Canada and one of the largest producers of opera in North America. The COC performs at the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, which was purpose-built for opera and ballet and is shared with the National Ballet of Canada. For forty years until April 2006, the COC had performed at the O'Keefe Centre (now known as Meridian Hall).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNicholas Goldschmidt and Herman Geiger-Torel founded the organization in 1950 as the Royal Conservatory Opera Company. Geiger-Torel became the COC's artistic director in 1956 and its general director in 1960. The company was renamed the Canadian Opera Association in 1960, and the Canadian Opera Company in 1977. Geiger-Torel retired from the general directorship in 1976. Lotfi Mansouri was the COC's general director from 1976 to 1988. In 1983, the COC introduced surtitles (supertitles) to their productions, the first company to use them in an opera house. Productions included Joan Sutherland's first performance of Donizetti's Anna Bolena.\nBrian Dickie served as the COC's general director from 1988 to 1993. Dickie named Richard Bradshaw the COC's chief conductor and head of music in 1989. Elaine Calder was the COC's general director from 1994 to 1997. In 1998, Bradshaw was named general director. During his tenure, Bradshaw secured funding for the COC's new permanent home, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts. Previously, the COC had been performing at the O'Keefe Centre (renamed to the Hummingbird Centre and then the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts).\nIn 2006, the COC opened its new opera house with an all-new production of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Michael Levine was the designer, and there were four directors: Michael Levine (Das Rheingold), Atom Egoyan (Die Walküre), François Girard (Siegfried), and Tim Albery (Götterdämmerung).\nIn 2006, Bradshaw's contract as general director was renewed for another 10 years. Bradshaw died of a sudden heart attack on August 15, 2007. In June 2008, Alexander Neef was named the COC's general director; he formally assumed the position in October 2008. In October 2008, Johannes Debus made his debut with the COC as a conductor in a production of Prokofiev's War and Peace, where he earned critical acclaim. In January 2009, the COC announced Debus's appointment as music director. Sandra Horst, who runs the University of Toronto's Opera Division, has long served as the company's chorus master.\nThe 2019/2020 COC theatre season was cut short due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, on which the COC ceased all productions after March 2020 due to restrictions on large indoor gatherings. The COC hoped to restart the shortened 2020/2021 theatre season by January 2021, however on October 6, 2020, company management announced that the entire 2020/2021 COC theatre season was cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic.\nNeef became director general of the Paris Opera in September 2020 and was replaced by Briton Perryn Leech in March 2021. In June 2024, Perryn Leech left and was replaced as general director by David C. Ferguson, a retired banker and accountant.\n\n\n== Recent productions ==\n\n\n=== 2008/2009 season ===\nMozart: Don Giovanni\nProkofiev: War and Peace\nBeethoven: Fidelio\nDvořák: Rusalka\nVerdi: Simon Boccanegra\nPuccini: La bohème\nBritten: A Midsummer Night's Dream\n\n\n=== 2009/2010 season ===\nPuccini: Madama Butterfly\nStravinsky: The Nightingale and Other Short Fables\nBizet: Carmen\nVerdi: Otello\nWagner: The Flying Dutchman\nDonizetti: Maria Stuarda\nMozart: Idomeneo\n\n\n=== 2010/2011 season ===\nAida by Giuseppe Verdi\nDeath in Venice (opera) by Benjamin Britten\nThe Magic Flute by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nNixon in China by John Adams (composer)\nLa Cenerentola by Gioachino Rossini\nAriadne auf Naxos by Richard Strauss\nOrfeo ed Euridice by Christoph Willibald Gluck\n\n\n=== 2011/2012 season ===\nIphigénie en Tauride by Christoph Willibald Gluck\nRigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi\nTosca by Giacomo Puccini\nL'Amour de loin by Kaija Saariaho\nThe Tales of Hoffmann by Jacques Offenbach\nEine florentinische Tragödie by Alexander von Zemlinsky\nGianni Schicchi by Giacomo Puccini\nSemele (Handel) by George Frideric Handel\n\n\n=== 2012/2013 season ===\nIl trovatore by Giuseppe Verdi\nDie Fledermaus by Johann Strauss II\nTristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner\nLa clemenza di Tito by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nSalome (opera) by Richard Strauss\nDialogues des Carmélites by Francis Poulenc\nLucia di Lammermoor by Gaetano Donizetti\n\n\n=== 2013/2014 season ===\nLa bohème by Giacomo Puccini\nPeter Grimes by Benjamin Britten\nCosì fan tutte by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nUn ballo in maschera by Giuseppe Verdi\nHercules (Handel) by George Frideric Handel\nRoberto Devereux by Gaetano Donizetti\nDon Quichotte by Jules Massenet\n\n\n=== 2014/2015 season ===\nFalstaff (opera) by Giuseppe Verdi\nMadama Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini\nDon Giovanni by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nDie Walküre by Richard Wagner\nThe Barber of Seville by Gioachino Rossini\nBluebeard's Castle by Béla Bartók\nErwartung by Arnold Schoenberg\n\n\n=== 2015/2016 season ===\nLa traviata by Giuseppe Verdi\nPyramus and Thisbe by Barbara Monk Feldman\nSiegfried (opera) by Richard Wagner\nThe Marriage of Figaro by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nCarmen by Georges Bizet\nMaometto II by Gioachino Rossini\n\n\n=== 2016/2017 season ===\nNorma (opera) by Vincenzo Bellini\nAriodante by George Frideric Handel\nThe Magic Flute by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nGötterdämmerung by Richard Wagner\nLouis Riel (opera) by Harry Somers\nTosca by Giacomo Puccini\n\n\n=== 2017/2018 season ===\nThe Elixir of Love by Gaetano Donizetti\nArabella by Richard Strauss\nRigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi\nAbduction from the Seraglio by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nThe Nightingale and Other Short Fables by Igor Stravinsky\nAnna Bolena by Gaetano Donizetti\n\n\n=== 2018/2019 season ===\nEugene Onegin by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nHadrian by Rufus Wainwright\nElektra by Richard Strauss\nCosì fan tutte by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nLa Bohème by Giacomo Puccini\nOtello by Giuseppe Verdi\n\n\n=== 2019/2020 season ===\nTurandot by Giacomo Puccini\nRusalka by Antonín Dvořák\nThe Barber of Seville by Gioachino Rossini\nHansel and Gretel by Engelbert Humperdinck\nAida by Giuseppe Verdi (cancelled)\nThe Flying Dutchman by Richard Wagner (postponed to 2022/2023 season)\n\n\n=== 2020/2021 season (cancelled) ===\nDue to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian Opera Company cancelled all live in-person performances for the 2020/2021 season.\n\n\n=== 2021/2022 season ===\nDue to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the COC cancelled several planned performances for the 2021/2022 season, but managed to produce 10 digital productions and two in-person productions in the spring of 2022.\n\nLa traviata by Giuseppe Verdi\nThe Magic Flute by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\n\n=== 2022/2023 season ===\nThe Flying Dutchman by Richard Wagner\nCarmen by Georges Bizet\nThe Marriage of Figaro by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nSalome by Richard Strauss\nMacbeth by Giuseppe Verdi\nTosca by Giacomo Puccini\nPomegranate by Kye Marshall and Amanda Hale\n\n\n=== 2023/2024 season ===\nFidelio by Ludwig van Beethoven\nLa bohème by Giacomo Puccini\nThe Cunning Little Vixen by Leoš Janáček\nDon Giovanni by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nDon Pasquale by Gaetano Donizetti\nMedea by Luigi Cherubini\nAportia Chryptych: A Black Opera for Portia White by HAUI x Sean Mayes\n\n\n=== 2024/2025 season ===\nNabucco by Giuseppe Verdi\nFaust by Charles Gounod\nMadama Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini\nLa Reine-garçon by Julien Bilodeau and Michel Marc Bouchard\nWozzeck by Alban Berg\nEugene Onegin by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nCavalleria rusticana by Pietro Mascagni\n\n\n== Notable members ==\nCornelis Opthof (bass-baritone), sang with the company for fifty years.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nCanadian Opera Company on Twitter\nCanadian Opera Company on Facebook"

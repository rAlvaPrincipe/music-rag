    "text": "Intricate Unit (IU) is an American industrial rock band formed by Ben Kopec. The band does not have a fixed line-up except for Kopec.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nAfter the album Denial, and shortly after graduating from high school, Kopec formed the first original line up for the band incorporating drummer, Chris Densky, and live guitarist, Jay Saucier. The trio performed live opening for acts such as Dope, Hanzel Und Gretyl, Zeromancer, Bile, and Nocturne. This line up eventually dissolved. As reported by Kopec in a 2005 interview for Space Junkies Magazine, Densky decided to focus all his energy on this original band, and Adva, and Saucier and Kopec had moral differences. \nIntricate Unit then recruited two new live members: bassist Roger Lockshier and guitarist Mark Turko.\nIntricate Unit's current line up consists of keyboardist, Ryan Dest, known better as DJ Nitez, and live guitarist Tom Voytek.\n\n\n== Tours ==\nIntricate Unit has performed with many other bands from the East Coast to the Mid-West of the United States. The band received radio play in over 15 states. To expand their audience and with the goal of becoming a national act, Intricate Unit has opened for bands such as Zeromancer, Insane Clown Posse, Hanzel Und Gretly, and Bile in live performances.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1999: Deception \n2000: Denial \n2002: Detached \n2005: Thru-Hole \n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent lineup\nBen Kopec – lead vocals, backup guitar (2001–present)\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n2004: A Try to Keep Away \n2004: Angel Moth \n2005: Vaccination Nation \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIntricate Unit Archived 2009-02-03 at the Wayback Machine (Web Archive), official website"

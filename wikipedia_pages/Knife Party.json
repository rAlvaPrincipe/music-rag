They along with Paul Harding formed the drum and bass band Pendulum. The duo started Knife Party as a side project to Pendulum. However, after the project's success and mass popularity, Knife Party became their primary project.\nThe name is derived from the Deftones song \"Knife Prty\" featured on the 2000 album White Pony. Knife Party's name caused consternation at first, as some said the name showed support for knife crime. Rob Swire rebutted this during an interview stating \"...we're not advocating any type of knife-related crime any more than Swedish House Mafia were advocating organised crime.\"\n\n\n=== 2011–2012: 100% No Modern Talking and Rage Valley ===\n\nOn 25 May 2011, Swire previewed a teaser of a Knife Party remix on SoundCloud labeled \"Not Pendulum\", which later turned out to be their remix of Swedish House Mafia's \"Save the World\".\nKnife Party's first EP, 100% No Modern Talking, was released digitally through Warner Bros. Records on 12 December 2011. The EP originally was to feature \"Back to the Z-List\" but was replaced with \"Destroy Them with Lazers\" as the duo had decided to abandon the track. The EP title refers to the lack of \"Modern Talking\", a wavetable in the software synthesiser NI Massive commonly used to create \"talking\" basslines.\nTheir second EP, Rage Valley, was released digitally through EarStorm and Big Beat. It was made available for purchase on Beatport and iTunes on 27 May 2012.\nThe song \"Bonfire\", released on this EP, was featured on an episode of AMC's Breaking Bad and in the video game WWE 2K15 (the latter of which features the instrumental version on its official soundtrack).

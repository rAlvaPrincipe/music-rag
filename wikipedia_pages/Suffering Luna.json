    "text": "Suffering Luna is an American hardcore punk band based in Los Angeles, California, United States. They are notable for their early contributions to the punk subgenre known as powerviolence and their split releases with Dystopia and Gasp. The band has existed since the early 1990s. Their music is a blend of crust and powerviolence with neo-psychedelia and noise. The inclusion of noise in their sound has led to comparisons with fellow pioneering powerviolence band Man is the Bastard/Bastard Noise.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Current lineup ===\n\"Messee\" – vocals\nSean Socco (Scalplock, Our Scars are Gifts, Ouroboros is Broken, Cryptids) – guitar, vocals, electronics\nPatrick Palma (Magnolia Thunderpussy, Melic Sub Rosa, Pipsqueak, M.K.Davis, Ouroboros is Broken, Cryptids, Research Inc.) – drums\nMathias Alderaan Derecha (Spirit of Hate, Cave State, Fractured, PRION) – bass, electronics\nDustin Johnston (Actuary, To the Point, Fractured, Spirit of Hate) - electronics\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nMitch Brown (Gasp) – drums, electronics\nJoe Lara – guitar\n\"Taz\" – bass, vocals\nFivel Perez (Runamuck) - bass, vocals\n\"Junior\" – drums\nSean Cole (F.Y.P., Toys That Kill) – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSelf Titled CD/LP (2011 To Live a Lie Records)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nBlood Filled Bong Cassette (2012 To Live a Lie Records)\n\n\n=== Splits ===\nSuffering Luna/Dystopia 7\" (1995 Pessimiser Records, reissued on Life Is Abuse/Misanthropic Records)\nSuffering Luna/Gasp LP (1996 Deep Six Records)\nSuffering Luna/Suffer the Storm LP (2014 King of the Monsters Records)\nSuffering Luna/Column of Heaven LP (2016 Nerve Altar Records)\nSuffering Luna/Chest Pain 7\" (2021 Here and Now!

As of 2012, she is based in Portland, Oregon. Dunham is trained in classical piano, cello and guitar.\n\n\n== History ==\nUnter Null (German for 'below zero') initially began as a powernoise project influenced by a number of similar prominent artists, including Noisex, Converter and P.A.L. Her first, self-titled, album was released in 2001. In 2002, she was signed to Leech and NTT/Annihilvs Records to release her second, web-exclusive album Neocide. In 2005, she signed to label Alfa Matrix. She has since released a number of EPs and albums, remixed several artists, and appeared on compilation albums. Her album The Failure Epiphany peaked at #4 on the German Alternative Charts (DAC) and ranked #43 on the DAC Top Albums of 2006. The same year, the Sacrament EP reached #6 on the DAC Singles chart.\n\n\n== Music ==\nIn early 2008, Dunham launched her side project Stray with the release of the self-titled a 2-CD album in cooperation with a number other bands including Mothboy, Detritus and Testube. In addition to regular live performances, Unter Null embarked on a short U.S. and European tour in 2005, then a longer European tour in 2006.\nIn the spring of 2012, Erica relocated to Hamburg, Germany, where at the time of writing, Erica is currently on production of the next Unter Null album.\n\n\n=== House fire ===\nOn December 25, 2008, Dunham's studio, containing her musical, recording and electronic equipment as well as other belongings, was destroyed in a fire.

    "text": "90 Day Men is an American progressive rock band formed in 1995 in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, and later based in Chicago, Illinois. Their name is a slang term used by police officers to refer to prison inmates who are due to undergo psychiatric examination.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group began as an early post-hardcore band, similar to Louisville, Kentucky, groups such as Slint and June of 44. Formed as a trio in 1995 by Brian Case, Cayce Key and Chandler McWilliams, it released its first 7\" single in 1996, \"Taking Apart the Vessel\".\nRobert Lowe joined the group in 1997 on trumpet and vocals but later moved to bass guitar when McWilliams departed. Their first recording with this line-up was the 7\" single, \"If You Can Bake a Cake, You Can Build a Bomb\", in 1997, followed by an EP on Temporary Residence in 1998. In late 1998, they signed with Southern Records, who released their first full-length album, titled (It (Is) It) Critical Band, in 2000. By this time, the keyboard player Andy Lansangan had joined the group. Two further LPs followed, To Everybody in 2002 and Panda Park in 2004, which was the subject of significant critical acclaim. The band formally disbanded in 2005 and played their last show together in 2006.\nThe same year, Lowe embarked a solo project called Lichens, and released solo material under the name Robert A. A. Lowe.\nThe guitarist, Brian Case, played in the Chicago garage rock band The Ponys, Disappears, and currently in a project called FACS.\nAs of 2021, drummer Cayce Key plays in Bloodiest.\nIn 2022, The Numero Group announced that it had procured rights to the back catalog from Southern, and began reissuing the band's discography onto streaming services.[1] \nOn January 19, 2024, Numero released We Blame Chicago, a compilation featuring the band's three albums, various EPs and singles, and several unreleased songs, including an unreleased Peel session originally recorded in 2001. On October 9, the band announced they would be reuniting for two shows at the Empty Bottle in Chicago on December 30 and 31. On November 20, it was announced that the compilation was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package category.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\n(It (Is) It) Critical Band (Southern Records, 2000)\nTo Everybody (Southern, 2002)\nPanda Park (Southern, 2004)\nEPs\n\nTaking Apart the Vessel (self-released, 1996)\nIf You Can Bake a Cake, You Can Build a Bomb (Action Boy, 1997)\n1975–1977–1998 (Temporary Residence, 1998) – contains the \"If You Can Bake a Cake, You Can Build a Bomb\" 7\"\nSplit with GoGoGo Airheart (Box Factory Records, 2000)\nToo Late or Too Dead (Southern, 2003)\nCompilations\n\nWe Blame Chicago (2024, Numero Group)\n\n\n== Members ==\nBrian Case (guitar, vocals)\nCayce Key (drums)\nChandler McWilliams (bass, 1995-97)\nRobert Lowe (bass, trumpet, vocals, 1997-2005)\nAndy Lansangan (keyboards, 2001-05)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n90 Day Men Myspace Page"

    "text": "Black Star Liner were formed in Leeds in 1994, by Choque Hosein, Tom Salmon, and Chris Harrop. Their music consisted of a mix of Asian music (sitar and tabla), dance music and dub.\n\n\n== History ==\nThey formed Soundclash Records to release their initial recordings - \"Smoke the Prophets\" EP, and \"High Turkish Influence\". After receiving the single of the week award in the NME magazine for \"Smoke the Prophets\", they recorded three Peel Sessions, the first of which was broadcast in April 1995.\nThe Peel session enabled them to secure a recording contract with EXP, which was run by Graham Brown-Martin with A&R by Feargal Sharkey from The Undertones and Richard Norris from The Grid. Their debut album, Yemen Cutta Connection was released in September 1996, with a press launch on Dartmoor involving Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond from The KLF. The album received critical praise, including album of the week in The Guardian.\nAfter the demise of EXP, Rob Dickens from WEA signed Black Star Liner, and they recorded their second album Bengali Bantam Youth Experience!, which featured the single \"Superfly and Bindi\". Again receiving substantial critical acclaim, the album was also nominated for the 1999 Mercury Music Prize. and their live act was also praised.\nLabelled as part of the Asian Underground, they worked with Tjinder Singh's Cornershop and are featured in the book, Brimful of Asia.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\"Smoke The Prophets\" EP (12\")\t\tSoundclash\t1994\n\"High Turkish Influence\" (12\")\t\tSoundclash\t1995\n\"The Jaws\" EP (10\")\tEXP Recordings\t1995\n\"Haláal Rock\" EP (CD, EP)\t\tEXP Recordings\t1996\n\"Haláal Rock\" EP (12\")\t\tEXP Recordings\t1996\n\"Harmon Session Special XI\" (12\")\t\tEXP Recordings\t1996\nYemen Cutta Connection (LP)\t\tEXP Recordings\t1996\nYemen Cutta Connection (CD)\t\tEXP Recordings\t1996\n\"Rock Freak (CD, Maxi)\"\tWEA International Inc.\t1997\n\"Rock Freak EP (12\")\"\t\tWarner Music UK Ltd.\t1997\n\"Superfly And Bindi (CD, Maxi)\"\t\tWEA International Inc.\t1998\n\"Superfly And Bindi (12\", Promo)\"\t\tWEA International Inc.\t1998\n\"Superfly And Bindi (12\")\"\t\tWarner Music UK Ltd.\t1998\nBengali Bantam Youth Experience!

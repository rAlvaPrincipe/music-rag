    "text": "Cat Rapes Dog is a Swedish electropunk, EBM and heavy metal band, formed in 1984 by Joel Rydström and Magnus Fransson. \nInitially the band self-released a number of albums on cassette, (then a trend followed by many independent acts of their type), plus a cassette album & vinyl singles on Swedish label Front Music Production.\nBetween 1989 and 1991 Cat Rapes Dog released three studio albums on KK Records, a Belgian independent label specialising in new beat, EBM and industrial acts (such as Front Line Assembly or Vomito Negro) that released over 300 titles between 1987 and 1996. Multiple Cat Rapes Dog albums were later released on Swedish independent labels Energy Rekords (Die Krupps, VNV Nation, Front 242, etc.) and Subspace Communications (Covenant, Apoptygma Berzerk, etc.) and on Artoffact Records of Toronto, Canada in 2013. Additional retrospective compilations have also been released by the above mentioned labels.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nCat Rapes Dog (1986, MC)\nNekronomikon (1987, MC)\nProperty Produces Bodily Injury (1987, MC)\nMaximum Overdrive (1989)\nGod, Guns & Gasoline (1990)\nSuperluminal (1991)\nSchizophrenia (1993)\nMoosehair Underwear (1993)\nBiodegradable (1995)\nFuck Nature (1995)\nMore Than You Bargained For (1995)\nThe Secrets of God (1998)\nPeople As Prey (1999)\nLife Was Sweet (2013)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nColumna Vertebralis (1989)\nDown & Out (1998)\nAmerican Dream 7\" (1990)\nChuckahomo Bridge 12\" (1990)\nFundamental 12\" (1990)\nMadman / True Love 7\" (1990)\nI Sometimes Wish I Was Famous (1991) (A Swedish Depeche Mode cover album: CRD collaborates with one track: \"Something to Do\" in which they altered some of the lyrics.)\nThe Banzai Beats (1991)\nSuperluminal (1991)\nTrojan Whores (1992)\nMoosewear (1993)\nNej till EU (1994)\nSucking Dry (1994)\nMotörhead Tribute (1995) (A Scandinavian Motörhead cover album: CRD collaborates with \"Deaf Forever\".)\nMotorman (1998)\nWorkers of The World (1998)\nMiaow at the Moon (2003)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial homepage\nCat Rapes Dog discography at MusicBrainz\nDiscogs Entry\nartist information/discography page at CyberNoise"

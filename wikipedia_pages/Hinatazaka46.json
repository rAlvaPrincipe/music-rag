    "text": "Hinatazaka46 (Japanese: 日向坂46) is a Japanese idol group produced by Yasushi Akimoto. The group was established as a subgroup of Keyakizaka46 named Hiragana Keyakizaka46 on 30 November 2015,  and was renamed and spun off into its own group on 11 February 2019. The group's name is adopted from the alternate reading of Hyūgazaka Street in Mita, Minato-ku, Tokyo, following the custom of naming groups after sloping streets in the Sakamichi Series. The captain of the group is Kumi Sasaki, with Mikuni Takahashi as vice-captain, and its fans are referred to as Ohisama (おひさま).\nAs a subgroup of Keyakizaka46, Hiragana Keyakizaka46's works were released as part of the main group's releases, except for the album Hashiridasu Shunkan (2018). As of September 2024, Hinatazaka46 has released twelve singles and two albums, and its first single, \"Kyun\", is the best-selling debut single by a female artist in Japan. Members of the group have also appeared in television dramas such as Re:Mind (2017), Dasada (2020), and Koeharu! (2021), the weekly variety show Hinatazaka de Aimashō, as well as a feature film and two theatrically released documentaries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2015–2018: Hiragana Keyakizaka46 ===\n\nThe group was established as Hiragana Keyakizaka46 (けやき坂46) on 30 November 2015, as a subgroup of Keyakizaka46, with their name written in hiragana as opposed to kanji. Colloquially, Hiragana Keyakizaka46 was also known as Hiragana Keyaki, while the main Keyakizaka46 group was known as Kanji Keyaki.\nAt its founding, Hiragana Keyakizaka46 consisted of only one member, Neru Nagahama, who did not participate in the Keyakizaka46 final audition due to her parents' earlier disapproval and was assigned to the subgroup as a \"special case\"; she would later be appointed a \"concurrent\" (兼任, ken'nin) member of both groups and join the main Keyakizaka46 lineup starting from their second single, \"Sekai ni wa Ai Shika Nai\" (2016). Auditions were held soon after for Hiragana Keyakizaka46, and the first generation of eleven members joined the group in May 2016. The group was initially announced as the \"under\" group to Keyakizaka46 with the possibility of its members also being selected for the main group's song lineup, a system already practiced by Nogizaka46. Due to the two groups' increasing activities, Nagahama left Hiragana Keyakizaka46 in September 2017, becoming only a member of the main group. A second generation of nine people was added in August 2017, and a third, again consisting of only Hinano Kamimura, was added in November 2018 through a Sakamichi Series joint audition. Kumi Sasaki was appointed the group's captain in June 2018.\nAs a subgroup, Hiragana Keyakizaka46 released their music as part of the main group's singles and albums. Their first release as a group is the B-side \"Hiragana Keyaki\" (ひらがなけやき) from \"Sekai ni wa Ai Shika Nai\", although Nagahama did perform \"Noriokureta Bus\" (乗り遅れたバス, lit. 'Missed Bus') from Keyakizaka46's debut single \"Silent Majority\" (2016) with several Keyakizaka46 members. In concerts, the two groups often performed together, but Hiragana Keyakizaka46 also held independent concerts, including a nationwide Zepp tour in 2017 and a three-day Nippon Budokan performance in January 2018, after Keyakizaka46 pulled out due to lead singer Yurina Hirate's injury. Hiragana Keyakizaka46 also released an independent album in 2018 titled Hashiridasu Shunkan.\nIn terms of variety shows, Hiragana Keyakizaka46 initially appeared in Keyakizaka46's shows Keyakitte, Kakenai? and KeyaBingo!, and started their own show Hiragana Oshi in 2018. The first generation also appeared in the drama series Re:Mind in 2017.\nFrom April to May 2018, Hiragana Keyakizaka46 members performed in the stage play Ayumi written by Yukio Shiba, where the characters (which consist of people of various ages and genders, as well as animals) was portrayed by different members on every scene change. The play was released on Hulu Japan in February 2021.\n\n\n=== 2019–2023: Reborn as Hinatazaka46 ===\n\nHiragana Keyakizaka46 became an independent group on 11 February 2019, and was renamed Hinatazaka46. The new name is an alternate reading of Hyūgazaka (日向坂) street in Minato-ku, Tokyo, following the custom of Sakamichi Series of having its groups named after sloping streets. The group's official Twitter and TikTok accounts were launched shortly, and their variety TV program was renamed to Hinatazaka de Aimashō. They also announced in a Showroom live broadcast that their fandom name would be Ohisama (おひさま), which is a slang for the Sun, as \"just like a sunny place (日向, hinata) cannot exist without the Sun, [Hinatazaka46] cannot exist without the fans\".\nTheir first single, \"Kyun\", was released on 27 March 2019, and surpassed 476,000 copies sold within the first week. The single became the best-selling debut single by a female artist in Japan, a record previously held by Keyakizaka46's \"Silent Majority\". \"Kyun\" also won the Best Choreography award at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards. On 24 September, a rhythm game titled Uni's On Air was released that featured Keyakizaka46 and Hinatazaka46. Hinatazaka46 attended the 70th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen for the first time in the group's history, where they performed \"Kyun\". After that, \"Azato Kawaii\" was shown at the 71st NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen, and \"Kimi Shika Katan\" was performed at the 72nd NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen, and \"Kitsune\" was performed at the 73rd NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen.\nOn 16 January 2020, the members of Hinatazaka46 were featured in a television series titled Dasada, with Nao Kosaka as the main protagonist. On 16 February 2020, three members were added to the third generation from the remaining unassigned members of the 2018 Sakamichi Series joint audition, bringing that generation up to four people. On 31 July 2020, Hinatazaka46 live streamed a concert titled Hinatazaka46 Live Online, Yes! With You!, where they announced that their first studio album will be released on 23 September. Their mascot character, a sky blue bird named Poka, was introduced at the live streamed Hinakuri (Hina Christmas) 2020 concert on 24 December.\nOn 7 March 2022, the group announced the audition for their fourth generation members with applications starting that day and screening taking place on 4 April. Twelve members passed the audition out of 51,038 participants, and they were gradually introduced to the public from 22 September to 3 October. They would make their musical debut with the song \"Blueberry & Raspberry\", included on the group's 8th single, \"Tsuki to Hoshi ga Odoru Midnight\". It was first shown at the Happy Smile Tour 2022 in Tokyo held on 12–13 November 2022.\nOn 30–31 March 2022, the group held their long-sought first Tokyo Dome concert, \"Hinatazaka46 3rd Anniversary Memorial Live in Tokyo Dome\" (3周年記念 Memorial Live ～3回目のひな誕祭～), attended by about 100,000 people in two days. The concert was originally scheduled for 2020, but postponed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFrom 30 March 2023, the Hinatazaka46 official website will start supporting in Japanese, English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Korean.\nOn 19 April 2023, the group announced the launching of the Hinatazaka Channel on YouTube for content other than music.\n\n\n=== 2024–present: Adopting the senbatsu system, first Hinata Fes ===\n\nIn March 2024, Hinatazaka46 opened its first exhibition, titled \"WE R!\", showcasing the group's history and various memorabilia. It consisted of the \"WE R!\" exhibition at the Roppongi Museum, held 1 March–13 May, and the \"WE R! in Tokyo Skytree﹣Rainbow of Hinatazaka46\" (WE R! in Tokyo Skytree﹣日向坂46の虹, WE R! in Tokyo Skytree﹣Hinatazaka46 no Niji) exhibition at the Tokyo Skytree, held 12 March–12 June.\nOn 5 April, Kyōko Saitō parted ways with the group with a \"graduation\" concert held at the Yokohama Stadium. She is the first member to leave who had served as original center (lead singer) for a title song, 2022's \"Tsuki to Hoshi ga Odoru Midnight\".\nThe 11th single, \"Kimi wa Honeydew\", released on 8 May, marked a significant change in the group's organization. While all active first to third-generation members participated in the title songs of previous releases, \"Kimi wa Honeydew\" is the first Hinatazaka46 release to implement a senbatsu (選抜, lit. 'selection') system, in which 16 selected members from all four generations active at the time performed the title song. Members who were not selected, commonly known as \"under girls\", are referred to as Hiragana Hinatazaka46 (ひなた坂46), similar to Hinatazaka46's former name Hiragana Keyakizaka46 (けやき坂46), and performed their own B-side song. Real Sound commented that this change was likely caused by the continuing departures of the group's founding first generation members, as well as the \"rapid\" development of the fourth generation members, five of whom were included in the senbatsu.\nHiragana Hinatazaka46's first independent concert would be held on 3−4 July at the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, continuing the usual practice of holding independent concerts for non-senbatsu members in the Sakamichi Series.\nOn 4 August, Hinatazaka46 announced that the recruitment process for the fifth generation members would begin on 5 August.\n\nOn 7–8 September, Hinatazaka46 held the first Hinata Fes in Miyazaki Prefecture, also known as the \"Hinata of Japan\" (日本のひなた, Nihon no Hinata) and first visited by the group in 2019 for location shooting of the variety show Hinatazaka de Aimashō. Approximately 40 thousand people attended the event, consisting of a two-day ticketed concert at the Hinata Sun Marine Stadium—the first concert ever held at the venue—and a free festival at the nearby Hinata Miyazaki Prefectural Comprehensive Sports Park. To accommodate the influx of attendees, the Kyushu Railway Company operated additional train services, including those named Hinatazaka46 and Ohisama, and the Hyūgashi Station was also temporarily renamed to Hinatazaka46 Station. The festival also aimed to minimize its impact on the environment and revitalize the economy of the region; the University of Miyazaki estimated that the festival brought about an economic ripple effect of about 2.9 billion yen from tourism in Miyazaki and surrounding areas.\nOn November 7, Mikuni Takahashi was announced to have been appointed as the first vice-captain of Hinatazaka46.\n\n\n== Members ==\nSince its founding, Hinatazaka46 has had a total of 37 members from four generations. 27 of those members are still in the group, though four have announced graduation.\nThird generation members marked with an asterisk (*) joined after the initial third generation member on 15 February 2020.\n\n\n=== Past members ===\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Notable subgroups ==\nThese are the subgroups of Hinatazaka46 that have appeared in events independent of the group.\n\n\n=== Hana-chans ===\nMembers: Suzuka Tomita, Konoka Matsuda\nHana-chans (花ちゃんズ, Hanachanzu) is an acoustic guitar duo unit, named after the flower (花, hana) kanji in both members' names. Their first song as a duo, \"Masaka Gūzen...\" (まさか偶然・・・, lit. 'Such Coincidence...'), was released as part of Hinatazaka46's third single.\nOn 27 June 2021, Hana-chans held their first independent live show on MTV Japan, titled MTV Acoustic Flowers – Until Full Bloom \"Bell & Like\"-, in which they covered Hinatazaka46 songs and Taylor Swift's \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". The performance was originally planned as a concert scheduled for 3 March 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; \"Until Full Bloom\" was a reference to the postponed event, while \"bell\" (鈴, suzu) and \"like\" (好, konomu) were references to the duo's given names.\nOn 5 October, the duo served as the opening act for MTV Live Match 2021, and also performed as part of Hinatazaka46 for the main event.\n\n\n=== Saitama Trio/Color Chart ===\nMembers: Miku Kanemura, Akari Nibu, Miho Watanabe (before graduation)\nThe Saitama Trio (埼玉トリオ), or Saitama Sannin-gumi (埼玉3人組), was the unofficial name for the three Hinatazaka46 members, all from the second generation, who are natives of Saitama Prefecture. In September 2018, they served as one-day traffic chiefs of the Saitama Prefectural Police to promote traffic safety. In November 2020, they joined the Saitama Supporters Group (埼玉応援団, Saitama Ōen-dan), a public relations group consisting of popular artists from the prefecture.\nIn October 2020, the trio started the radio program Belc presents Hinatazaka46 no Yokei na Kotomade Yarimashō! on Tokyo FM; the supermarket chain Belc, which sponsors the program, subsequently released limited edition food products in collaboration with them. They also became voice actresses for the first animated miniseries based on the character Pickles the Frog,\nwhich first became associated with Hiragana Keyakizaka46 in 2017 after Kanemura gave a Pickles doll to each second generation member as Christmas presents.\nIn February 2021, the Saitama Trio were voted the most wanted unit (subgroup with their own songs) by fans on a Twitter campaign to commemorate Hinatazaka46's second debut anniversary. Hinatazaka46's sixth single, released in October 2021, would include their first song as a trio, \"Akubi Letter\" (あくびLetter, lit. 'Yawn Letter'), performed under the unit name Color Chart (カラーチャート); the name is a reference to a nickname for Saitama Prefecture, \"Sai no Kuni\" (彩の国, transl. Land of Colors).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Promotional singles ===\n\n\n=== Songs from Keyakizaka46's releases ===\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n=== Videography ===\n\n\n==== Video albums ====\n\n\n== Tours and concerts ==\nHinatazaka46 holds several regular annual concerts. The Hinatansai (ひな誕祭, portmanteau of Hinatazaka and seitansai 生誕祭, lit. 'holy birthday') concerts, held in March or April, are to celebrate their debut anniversary on 27 March 2019. The W-Keyaki Festival (pronounced \"Double Keyaki Festival\") concerts in the summer were held jointly with Sakurazaka46 in 2021 and 2022 as the two groups formerly known as Keyakizaka46, and were the continuation of the Keyaki Republic (欅共和国, Keyaki Kyōwakoku) concerts held annually by that group at the Fuji-Q Highland Conifer Forest until 2019. Hinakuri (ひなくり, short for Hina Christmas) are held on or around Christmas, and was first held as the Hiragana Christmas (ひらがなくりすます) concert in 2018. Aside from these, there have also been various non-regular concerts, tours, and other live events.\n\n\n=== Concerts ===\n\n\n==== Hiragana Keyakizaka46 ====\n\"Keyakizaka46 Joint Performance\" (けやき坂46単独公演) ( 21–22 March 2017: Zepp Tokyo)\n\"Hiragana Keyaki Nippon Budokan 3 Days\" (ひらがなけやき日本武道館3Days) (30 January – 1 February 2018: Nippon Budokan)\n\"Hiragana Christmas 2018\" (ひらがなくりすます2018) ( 11–13 December 2018: Nippon Budokan)\n\n\n==== Hinatazaka46 ====\n\"Hinatazaka46 Debut Countdown Live\" (日向坂46デビューカウントダウンライブ) ( 5–6 March 2019: Yokohama Arena)\n\"3rd Single Release Commemorative Live\" (3rdシングル発売記念ワンマンライブ) (26 September 2019: Saitama Super Arena)\nHinaChri (ひなくり) (Christmas Live)\nHinaChri 2019 〜17Nin no Santa Claus to Sora no Christmas〜 (ひなくり2019 〜17人のサンタクロースと空のクリスマス〜) ( 17–18 December 2019: Makuhari Messe International Exhibition Hall Hall 4–6, second day also livestreamed)\nHinaChri 2020〜Obake Hotel to 22 Nin no Santa Claus〜 (ひなくり2020〜おばけホテルと22人のサンタクロース〜) (24 December 2020, only livestreamed)\nHinaChri 2021 (ひなくり2021) ( 24–25 December 2021: Makuhari Messe International Exhibition Hall 9–11 Hall, both days also livestreamed)\nHinaChri 2022 (ひなくり2022) ( 17–18 December 2022: Ariake Arena, second day also livestreamed)\nHina Birthday Festival (ひな誕祭) (Anniversary Live)\nHinatazaka46 Debut 1 Syūnen Kinen Special talk and Live (日向坂46デビュー1周年記念 スペシャルトーク&ライブ) (31 March 2020: livestreaming only on YouTube)\n〜Memorial Live: 2 Kaime no Hinatansai〜 (～MEMORIAL LIVE：2回目のひな誕祭～) (27 March 2021: livestreamed concert with limited audience seats, 746 seats were available)\nHinatazaka46 3rd Anniversary Memorial Live 〜 3 Kaime no Hinatansai〜 (日向坂46 3周年記念MEMORIAL LIVE ～3回目のひな誕祭～) ( 30–31 March 2022: Tokyo Dome, both days also livestreamed)\nHinatazaka46 4th Anniversary Memorial Live 〜 4 Kaime no Hinatansai〜 (日向坂46 4周年記念MEMORIAL LIVE ～4回目のひな誕祭～) ( 1–2 April 2023: Yokohama Stadium, second day also livestreamed)\nHinatazaka46 5th Anniversary Memorial Live 〜 5 Kaime no Hinatansai〜 (日向坂46 5周年記念MEMORIAL LIVE ～5回目のひな誕祭～)( 6–7 April 2024: Yokohama Stadium, both days also livestreamed)\nUnit Festival (ユニット祭り)（only livestreamed）\nHinatazaka46 Haru no Unit Festival Ohisama Best Playlist2021 (春のユニット祭り おひさまベスト・プレイリスト2021) (6 March 2021: Hikari TV Channel)\nHinatazaka46 Fuyu no Dai Unit Festival Christmas Special (日向坂46 冬の大ユニット祭り\"X'masスペシャル)（22 December 2022: Makuhari Messe International Exhibition Hall 9 Hall）\nW-Keyaki Fes.

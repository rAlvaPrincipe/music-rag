The 21st Infantry Band, 4 years earlier based at Fort Snelling, under the direction of Charles W. Graves (born about 1864 Kenton, Ohio), was one of seven military bands selected to perform at the Saint Louis World Fair of 1904.\nFebruary 4, 1908, he was promoted to sergeant. On March 21, 1909, he was appointed Acting Chief Musician. On May 5, 1909, he was appointed chief musician and left the service December 16, 1909, at that position.

The 20th Infantry Band was on patrol duty on the Mexican border.\n\n\n==== Other units at Camp Cotton ====\nCamp Cotton – named for its locale in the Cotton subdivision in the southeastern part of El Paso – was, in 1913, a newly established military camp that, initially, hosted the 20th Infantry, the 12th Cavalry squadron of 4 troops and C troop of the 13th Cavalry.\nIn July 1912, the 16th Infantry returned from its second tour in the Philippines for duty at the Presidio in San Francisco. Two years later, the regiment was transferred with the 8th Brigade, commanded by General \"Black Jack\" Pershing, to the Mexican border to help secure it from depredations by Mexican bandits and paramilitary forces commanded by Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa. Upon arrival in April 1914, the regiment was posted to Camp Cotton.  In response to Pancho Villa's attack on Columbus, New Mexico, March 1916 – about 80 miles west of El Paso – President Woodrow Wilson ordered Pershing conduct a punitive expedition into Mexico to hunt, find, and punish Pancho Villa (see Pancho Villa Expedition).\n\n\n=== Conservatory of Mérida ===\nThe School of Music of the State of Yucatan was inaugurated November 30, 1911, in Mérida. Shortly thereafter, it was renamed Conservatorio de Mérida. Francisco Quevedo was its first director. Antonio de la Mora, one of the founding music professors, taught counterpoint and instrumentation.\n\n\n=== Canadian Expeditionary Force ===\nBefore the United States entered World War I, the Canadian Expeditionary Force recruited Americans to fill ranks of the 97th Battalion, one of five American Legion battalions that had greatly deteriorated.

While there, he published his book, Cornetist Alphabet, and organized the Hamasa Temple Shrine Band.  He remained in Meridian until about late-November-early-December when he married Susan May Stennis (maiden; 1899–1973) in Meridian and, with her, moved to New Orleans for his work as a musician.  When he signed his World War I Draft Registration on September 12, 1818, he provided the name of his wife, Amanda de la Mora, and his address at 817 24th Avenue (between 8th and 9th Streets), Meridian, Mississippi, an address that corresponds to the site upon which the Hamasa Temple was built in 1924. The Meridian Shriners contracted the Saenger organization to design, build, and operate the auditorium in their building. The Saenger organization was the same organization that designed, built, owned, and operated the Strand in New Orleans, where de la Mora began working in 1918.\n\n\n=== Strand Theatre Orchestra, New Orleans ===\nBeginning late-November-early-December 1918, De la Mora worked as a musician in New Orleans in the Concert Orchestra under the direction of Don Philippini (né Salvatore Philippini; 1870–1950) of the recently built Strand Theater.  The Strand, no longer in existence, was at the corner of Baronne and Gravier Streets for about 53 years.\nOn February 9, 1919, de la Mora seemingly tried to commit suicide by leaping eighteen feet to the street from the second-story window of the newspaper editorial room of the New Orleans States building at 619 Canal Street. News accounts attributed de la Mora's distress to a prior nervous breakdown from overwork and marital unhappiness relating to disagreements with in-laws. De la Mora, about two months earlier, had married Susan May Stennis (maiden; 1899–1973) in Meridian, Mississippi.  Soon after marrying, they moved to New Orleans and resided at 611 St. Charles Street (at Lafayette Square).\n\n\n=== Wichita, Kansas ===\n\nIn 1925, Antonio de la Mora was living in Wichita, Kansas, at 1665 North Waco Avenue with his wife, Martha, and two sons, Antonio, Jr., and Adolphus.

He trained a 45-piece band composed mostly of youth from the community.  De la Mora, with Martha (1903–1983), Antonio, Jr. (1922–1985), and Adolfo (born 1934) – his wife and two sons – resided at 2322 Monitor Place.  The Mexican communities in Wichita and Kansas City were viewed somewhat as colonies for Mexican exiles.\n\n\n==== Death in Kansas City, Missouri ====\nAntonio de la Mora died May 9, 1926. Dr. Nicolás Jaime (1885–1965) (surname pronounced \"high-me\" with the accent evenly divided) was the attending physician who signed the death certificate. He and Dr. Othoniel de Rivas y Jaén (1890–1973), a Granada, Nicaragua-born chiropractor, held a funeral vigil for Antonio de la Mora May 22, 1926, at the U.C.M.\nDr. Jaime, a co-founder of the U.C.M., 73 days earlier had signed a US$2,500 bail bond (equivalent to US$43,026 in 2023) for Jorge Prieto Laurens (1895–1990), who was elected and served as interim governor of San Luis Potosí in 1923 for one year, was indicted in San Antonio and arrested on February 28, 1926, in Kansas City, on a charge by the Mexican government that he had, as part of the Huerta faction, participated in a plot to overthrow (another revolution) the then present Mexican regime, a government for which, diplomatically, the United States was on friendly terms.  Dr. Jaime, himself, was a 1915 Mexican exile.  But as a community member, in 1958, he was named \"Man of the Year\" by the Kansas City Academy of General Practice.\n\n\n=== Memorial band ===\nIn 1927, after the death of Antonio de la Mora, the \"Antonio de la Mora Band,\" directed by Alfredo Antonio González Flores (1904–1983), continued to perform in Kansas City.

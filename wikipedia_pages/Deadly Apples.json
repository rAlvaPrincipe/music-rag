The band consists of frontman / lyricist Alex Martel (vocals) and songwriter / producer Antoine Lamothe (drums), with live musicians joining them on stage. The band is known for its high energy and intense live performances. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn early 2017, the band released the Infected EP on streaming platforms. Paul Barker, formerly of Ministry, remixed the song \"Self Inflicted Oppression\" with samples from Ministry's \"Psalm 69\". The remix was featured on the soundtrack for the documentary film Fix: The Ministry Movie. The band also released several songs from their first full-length album, Petty, which was mixed by Vance Powell, mastered by Bob Ludwig and featuring Munky from Korn as guest guitarist on the songs \"Further\" and \"Help\".   \nIn 2017, the band supported Rammstein in Canada and released a music video for \"Further\" directed by Lamothe. More shows were announced for 2017, including festival slots at Knotfest and Fronterizo Fest, as well as support dates for Deftones in Mexico.\nIn February 2018, the band sold out the National club in Montreal.

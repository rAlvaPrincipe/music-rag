    "text": "Screams for Tina was an American death rock and gothic rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1985 by Warren Mansfield (vocals, bass, keyboards) and Marvin Rinnig (guitar).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe duo of Mansfield and Rinnig recorded a five-song 12-inch EP, Strobelight Funeral, released in 1986 on their own Dark Illusion Records label.\nEnglish bassist Billy Budd and local drummer Bobbi Drier joined in 1987, and the band became regular performers at LA clubs such as Scream, The Roxy and the Whisky a Go Go.\nIn 1988, L.A. Weekly  held a citywide Rock Music Awards poll, and Screams for Tina placed in the Top 5 of the Best New Band and Best Underground Band categories, as well as in the Top 10 for Independent Album.\nIn 1990, Rinning was replaced by Kent Bancroft (Like Wreckage, Spahn Ranch). They released the double-7\" EP Judgement Day in 1992 on Piece Of Mind Records.\nCleopatra Records included the band's song \"11:11\" on the 1993 compilation album The Whip. This led to the release of their eponymous first full-length studio album that year by Cleopatra in the US and Talitha Records in Germany.\nIn 1998, the group disbanded but it reformed in 2002 as a duo of Mansfield and Budd, and signed to Austrian label Strobelight Records, releasing the four-song EP 2003 A.D. the next year.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nScreams for Tina (1993, Cleopatra Records/Talitha Records)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nStrobelight Funeral 12-inch (1986, Dark Illusion Records)\nJudgement Day 7-inch (1992, Piece of Mind Records)\n2003 A.D.

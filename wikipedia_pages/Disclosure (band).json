    "text": "Disclosure is an English electronic music duo consisting of brothers Howard (born 11 May 1994) and Guy Lawrence (born 25 May 1991). They grew up in Reigate, Surrey. Their debut studio album, Settle, released on 3 June 2013, by PMR Records, was nominated for Best Dance/Electronica Album at the 2014 Grammy Awards. They released a second studio album, Caracal, on 25 September 2015 which was also nominated for Best Dance/Electronic Album at the 2016 Grammy Awards. Their third studio album, Energy, was released on 28 August 2020, and was nominated for Best Dance/Electronic Album at the 2021 Grammy Awards, alongside the fourth single from the album, \"My High\", which was nominated for Best Dance Recording.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDisclosure were born to professional musician parents. Their father played in rock bands, including 'No Angry Man' and 'The Look Book' alongside his brother and Guy's godfather, and is now a professional auctioneer, whilst their mother, a session musician, fronted bands, toured on cruises, sang advert jingles, and was one of the first performers to entertain the British Army after their recapture of the Falkland Islands. Guy started playing the drums at the age of three, and Howard started playing the bass at the age of eight. Both also learned to play the guitar and the piano and Howard to sing.\nThey both attended Reigate College. During this period, the boys studied music and music technology. By the age of 15, Howard listened mainly to funk, soul and maudlin singers, whilst Guy listened predominantly to hip hop, dubstep and was the drummer in an indie-style guitar band with school friends.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhilst Guy was attending Reigate College, he enjoyed studying classical music, especially the likes of Bach and Claude Debussy. A teenage interest in the music and production techniques of Detroit-based rapper and record producer J Dilla, led him through hip hop to attending dubstep gigs as a student; but he enjoyed house music more as a creation, and began studying it and introducing his brother to it. Primarily influenced by artists including Joy Orbison, James Blake, Burial and Mount Kimbie, the brothers were led back in time to Chicago house, Detroit techno, UK garage and 2-step garage.\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: Debut ===\nThe brothers started de-constructing and copying the music that Guy had heard at gigs in a room above their father's auction house, and then making music in the same room in a style they refer to as \"electronic house music with a pop structure\", uploading it to Myspace. This got them an early record deal, and a UK tour, mixing live music gigs with occasional DJ sets, where in Manchester, they played a set before Todd Edwards, and gained after gig all-night conversation.\nThe duo's first single, \"Offline Dexterity\" was released on 29 August 2010. They signed to the new PMR record label on its formation in January 2011, and released their second single, \"Carnival\"/\"I Love...That You Know\" on 13 June 2011. This got them a management deal with Sam Evitt and Jack Street's Method Management whom they are still managed by.\n\n\n=== 2012–2014: Commercial success and Settle ===\nDisclosure picked up their first significant national radio support upon the release of the \"Tenderly\" / \"Flow\" single in January 2012. The single led to significant interest in the subsequent June 2012 EP, The Face, released on Greco-Roman. The EP included the popular remix of \"Running\" by Jessie Ware a fellow PMR artist which charted in both the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as becoming a fixture of the 2012 Festival Circuit and featuring on the annual edition of Annie Mac presents.\nThrough collaboration with other artists signed to Method Management, the group had their first UK hit in October 2012 with \"Latch\", co-written with Jimmy Napes and featuring the vocals from Sam Smith, which peaked at number 11 in the UK Singles Chart.\nThe group maintained their momentum into 2013 – they were voted into the BBC Radio 1xtra 'Hot Ten For 2013' and scored two consecutive top 10 hit singles in \"White Noise\" (number two) (with AlunaGeorge) and \"You & Me\" (number 10) (with Eliza Doolittle). These three singles were collected on an EP, The Singles. They released their debut studio album, Settle, by PMR Records on 3 June 2013 and was met with commercial and critical success, debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, charting in many countries across Europe and Australia, and receiving four stars from The Guardian and a 9.1 score on Pitchfork. They performed twice at Glastonbury Festival 2013 and appeared on Later... with Jools Holland. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Dance Album.\nIn 2013, Disclosure embarked on a worldwide tour of more than 40 European, American, and Canadian cities, including high-profile music festivals such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Lollapalooza Music Festival in Chicago, and Sasquatch! Music Festival in Washington State. The same year, they established the record label Method Records; its roster includes Friend Within, Karen Harding, Lxury, and Tourist. A sub label was introduced in February 2015, called Method White, releasing more underground tracks through it. The first release was \"Wolfsbane\" by Jonas Rathsman. Since then, M. J. Cole and Eats Everything have released tracks through the label. Disclosure's song \"When a Fire Starts to Burn\" was used in the sixth episode of the first season of The 100.\n\n\n=== 2015–2018: Caracal and hiatus ===\nFollowing the worldwide success of their debut studio album, Settle and a worldwide tour, the duo began working on their second studio album, Caracal, featuring vocals from Sam Smith, Lorde, Gregory Porter, Lion Babe, Kwabs, The Weeknd, Nao, Miguel, Jordan Rakei and Brendan Reilly. The week of its release, Caracal earned the group their second consecutive number one album in the UK Albums Chart.\nThe music videos for official singles from the album published on YouTube are interconnected and follow a story line, each newly released video furthering the plot. The videos follow a young woman in a sci-fi, dystopian world who is, for some unknown reason, being chased by the police.\nThree singles were released prior to the album: \"Omen\", \"Holding On\" and \"Jaded\". Two promotional singles were also released: \"Willing and Able\" and \"Hourglass\". The album was released on 25 September 2015, by PMR Records and Island Records. The album was also nominated for Best Dance/Electronica Album at the 2016 Grammy Awards.\nIn February 2017, the duo announced they were to take a year's hiatus with the exception of \"a few special things\", including performances with BBC Radio 1 in Ibiza and the return of their festival Wildlife that summer.\n\n\n=== 2018–present: Energy and Alchemy ===\nIn January 2018, the duo confirmed that they were in the process of recording their third studio album set for release in early 2020, with a single due in between late 2019 and early 2020. After a hiatus, Disclosure released a song in May 2018 called \"Ultimatum\" featuring Fatoumata Diawara. In August 2018, five new songs were released over a daily basis: \"Moonlight\", \"Where Angels Fear to Tread\", \"Love Can Be So Hard\", \"Funky Sensation\" and \"Where You Come From\". In October 2019 Disclosure performed at the Trafalgar Square leg of Extinction Rebellion's \"International Rebellion\" protest. The singles, furthermore, announced their comeback into the studio and revealed that they had started to write and produce new material, which would eventually form their third studio album. On February 24, 2020, they released a new track titled \"Ecstasy\", followed by four tracks released on a daily basis: \"Tondo\", \"Expressing What Matters\", \"Etran\" and \"Get Close\". An EP titled Ecstasy, which contained the five tracks, was released on February 28. On the album's release date, Disclosure will have a special Minecraft server for The Energy Minecraft Experience.

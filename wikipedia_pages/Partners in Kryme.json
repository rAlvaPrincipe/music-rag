Its members were James Alpern and Richard Usher, using the stage names of DJ Keymaster Snow and MC Golden Voice, respectively. They are most famously known for their debut single, \"Turtle Power!\", which was written for and featured in the movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in 1990, and became an international hit, reaching number 13 in the US and number one for four weeks in the UK. The song was infamous for erroneously calling Raphael the \"leader of the group.\" Usher in an interview stated the group had no previous knowledge of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and based the lyrics for the song from a synopsis given by the producers, and with Raphael as the main character in the first film, they expected he was the leader. By the time they learned he wasn't, the song was already finished and filming nearly complete. \nA second single, \"Undercover\", was released on Capitol Records, but the group never released a full-length album. Another song, \"Love 2 Love U\" was recorded in 1991 for the soundtrack of Cool as Ice movie.\nAccording to the UK magazine Smash Hits, the word Kryme is in fact an acronym for K.eep R.hythm Y.our M.otivating E.lement;\nOn May 30, 2015, Partners In Kryme released a new single centered on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on their official YouTube channel, entitled \"Rock The Halfshell.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

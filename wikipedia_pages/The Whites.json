Buck grew up playing music and started playing in dances wrestling arenas, auditoriums but he didn't really like that atmosphere a lot. Buck had two jobs when the sisters were growing up; a plumber by day, piano and mandolin player by night. He started really enjoying music when his family started playing together all around the world. In the beginning, Sharon took up bass when she was twelve, moving to guitar when Cheryl took over on bass. \nIn the 1980s, they scored such hits as \"You Put The Blue In Me\", \"Hangin' Around\", \"Give Me Back That Old Familiar Feeling\", \"Pins And Needles\", \"If It Ain't Love (Let's Leave It Alone)\", \"Hometown Gossip\", and \"When The New Wears Off of Our Love\".\nIn August 1981, Sharon White married Ricky Skaggs, who performed on several of the Whites' early releases.

Their collaborative album with Ricky Skaggs, \"Salt of the Earth\" won the 2008 Grammy for Best Southern/Country/Bluegrass Album.\nThe Whites can be heard on the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack with the song \"Keep on the Sunny Side\". They also appear in Down from the Mountain, the documentary of a concert given by the soundtrack artists.\nThe Whites were inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame on Saturday, August 16, 2008, in Carthage, Texas.  They were inducted along with Buck Owens and Mickey Newbury.\nAlso performing on the Grand Ole Opry with Buck, Sharon and Cheryl is Rosanna, better known as Rosie, the third of the four White sisters.

It is located on Sükhbaatar Street in the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar. It is under the direct command of the Mongolian Defense Ministry.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt was founded on December 12, 1932, as a small musical quorum for the army. It was the first professional fine art organization to work with the purpose of strengthening the morale of the national military. It was composed of Mongolian laborers and young people in military affairs, and nomads, all three of which presented their traditional customs, aesthetics and morals to the public as part of the ensemble. It was instrumental in the cultural support of the Mongolian People's Army led by Khorloogiin Choibalsan during the Battles of Khalkhin Gol and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. It was transferred to the General Purpose Force of the Mongolian Armed Forces following the fall of communism in 1992.\n\n\n== Notability ==\nThe ensemble is often considered to be the equivalent to the Alexandrov Ensemble. It commonly undertakes visits to foreign countries in the Eurasian region to conduct concerts and other performances.

In 2002, on the occasion of the Platinum jubilee of the ensemble, it was awarded the honorary title of being an \"Academic ensemble\".\nIt has recently pursued a policy of cooperating with art organizations in foreign countries. These ensembles include but are not limited to: the Alexandrov Ensemble, the United States Army Chorus and the Choir of the French Army. In addition, it has also signed agreements with domestic tourism organizations such as Nomadic Expeditions.

    "text": "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the film score to the 2016 film of the same name, composed by James Newton Howard. A limited edition vinyl was first released on 4 November 2016. The soundtrack was later released in both digital and physical formats on 18 November 2016 by WaterTower Music.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 6 April 2016, it was announced that James Newton Howard would be composing the music for the film with veteran Harry Potter director David Yates at the helm and J.K Rowling penning the screenplay. Howard stated that the film posed a \"particular challenge\" for him as it needed to be different and distinguishable from the previous Harry Potter films which saw iconic themes from acclaimed composers John Williams, Patrick Doyle, Nicholas Hooper and Alexandre Desplat. In an interview with Pottermore, Howard stated that \"it really is a balance of keeping the magic, the slight tension and the comedy. You don’t want it to be too much one way or the other. It’s always a balancing act between things like pace, character point of view, action and humour.\" Discussions with Yates, suggested that the music should feel \"like we’re being invited into a grand adventure\".\nHoward spent the majority of the time writing the themes at his piano for the main characters. For the character of Newt, he wrote two primary themes, a theme that displays Newt's warm personality and whimsicalness, and a theme for Newt's heroic actions which Howard calls \"kind of the big, muscular hero theme\". For Jacob, Howard crafted a tune that encompasses \"lazy, bluesy 1920s quasi-jazzy kind\". There were also themes for the creatures namely, the Erumpent, Demiguise and the Niffler.\nThe score was conducted by Pete Anthony with a 97-piece of the London Symphony Orchestra and was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, with orchestrations provided by Anthony, Jeff Atmajian, Peter Boyer, Chris Egan, Jim Honeyman, Philip Klein, Jon Kull and John Ashton Thomas. The score was mixed by Shawn Murphy.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll tracks are composed and performed by James Newton Howard.\n\nAll tracks are composed and performed by James Newton Howard, except where noted.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References =="

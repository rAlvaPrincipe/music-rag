    "text": "Vision Eternel is a Canadian-American ambient rock band. Formed by guitarist Alexander Julien in Edison, New Jersey, United States in January 2007, the band eventually relocated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in July 2007. The musical group's sound has been described variously by critics as a blend of ambient, shoegaze, post-rock, ethereal, drone, space rock, emo, post-black metal, post-metal, dark ambient, dark wave, experimental rock, minimal, dream pop, progressive rock, modern classical, and new-age.\nWhile still based in New Jersey, the musical group also included second guitarist Philip Altobelli, though he departed before the recording of the band's second release. Once established in Quebec, the band was expanded with two more guitarists, Nidal Mourad and Adam Kennedy, but they departed before the recording of the band's third output.\nThe band released its debut extended play, Seul Dans L'obsession, in 2007, followed by another extended play, Un Automne En Solitude, in 2008, both via American record label Mortification Records. In 2009, a compilation album of the first two extended plays, titled An Anthology of Past Misfortunes, was released by Japanese record label Frozen Veins Records. In 2010, Vision Eternel contributed the exclusive single \"Start From the Beginning: The Accident\" to Dedicated Records' Various Artists compilation, Great Messengers: Palms.\nAfter signing with Canadian record label Abridged Pause Recordings, Vision Eternel followed up with three more extended plays: Abondance De Périls in 2010, The Last Great Torch Song in 2012, and Echoes from Forgotten Hearts in 2015. In 2018, Abridged Pause Recordings released the boxed set An Anthology of Past Misfortunes, which contains remastered versions of the band's entire 2007–2015 output, along with a bonus compilation of previously unreleased demos and b-sides. British record label Fruits de Mer Records released three singles by the band: \"Killer of Giants\" in 2019, \"Moments of Absence\" in 2020, and \"Pièce No. Sept\" in 2022. The band's sixth extended play, For Farewell of Nostalgia, was co-released by American record label Somewherecold Records, Dutch record label Geertruida, and Abridged Pause Recordings in 2020. A deluxe edition of Echoes from Forgotten Hearts was released by Geertruida in 2024, which contains the previously unreleased soundtrack version of the recording.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent lineup\n\nAlexander Julien – electric guitar, acoustic guitar, electric bass guitar, eBow (2007–present)\nFormer members\n\nPhilip Altobelli – electric guitar, classical guitar (2007)\nNidal Mourad – acoustic guitar (2008)\nAdam Kennedy – electric guitar (2008)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nEPs\nSeul Dans L'obsession (Mortification Records, 2007)\nUn Automne En Solitude (Mortification Records, 2008)\nAbondance De Périls (Abridged Pause Recordings, 2010)\nThe Last Great Torch Song (Abridged Pause Recordings, 2012)\nEchoes from Forgotten Hearts (Abridged Pause Recordings, 2015 / Geertruida, 2024)\nFor Farewell of Nostalgia (Somewherecold Records / Geertruida / Abridged Pause Recordings, 2020)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nVision Eternel discography at Discogs \nVision Eternel at IMDb\nVision Eternel discography at MusicBrainz"

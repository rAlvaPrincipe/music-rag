    "text": "The West Australian Youth Jazz Orchestra (WAYJO) is an Australian youth jazz orchestra based in Perth, Western Australia. WAYJO has 54 jazz musicians between 14 and 25 years of age and currently presents over 55 performances a year across Australia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe West Australian Youth Jazz Orchestra was founded in 1983. The original band was formed from secondary school students from the music specialist schools, young local musicians and some of the original students of the inaugural Jazz Studies course at the WA Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA). \nBy the early 1990s WAYJO had grown to two bands and by the late 1990s three bands were in operation each with its own music director, which remains the position today. The three bands are the Composers Ensemble, the Big Band and the Swing Band. Each band works on specific repertoire which builds on the existing skill levels of the musicians.\nSince 2008 their artistic director is Mace Francis who is also musical director for their Wednesday Night Orchestra.\n\n\n== Albums ==\nNight and Day\nRecorded October 1996 at the Western Australian Conservatorium of Music\nWAYJO 1\nMD – Graeme Lyall\nAlto 1 – Michael Collinson\nAlto 2 – Graeme Blevins\nTenor 1 – James Sandon\nTenor 2 – Ben Phillips\nBaritone – Mark Sprogowski\nTrumpet 1 – Darryl Wilson\nTrumpet 2 – Damien Maughn\nTrumpet 3 – Matthew Jodrell\nTrumpet 4 – Benn Hodgkin\nTrombone 1 – Jeremy Greig\nTrombone 2 – Tim French\nTrombone 3 – Peter Yunken\nBass Trombone – Brett Page\nGuitar – Andre Bourgault\nPiano – Tom O'Halloran\nBass – Graham Local\nDrums – Gavin Kerr\nVocals – Bronwynn Way\nVocals – Penny Cullen\nWAYJO 2 (The Queen Bee)\nMD – Shane Mancuso\nAlto 1 – Marion Collins\nAlto 2 – Jodie Bennett\nTenor 1 – April Ashton\nTenor 2 – Aaron Cargill\nBaritone – Chris Jodrell\nTrumpet 1 – Sam Graham\nTrumpet 2 – Simon O'Neill\nTrumpet 3 – Tim Colgan\nTrumpet 4 – Ben Basell\nTrombone 1 – Laurence Le Page\nTrombone 2 – Jayne Hehir\nTrombone 3 – Kathryn Smith\nTrombone 4 – Ben Harrison\nGuitar – Antony Gray\nPiano – Pat Drury\nBass – Philip Waldron\nDrums – Tom Coveney\nTom Terrific\n1.Taking a Break 09:33\n2.

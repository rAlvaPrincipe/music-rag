    "text": "Fat Larry's Band was an American R&B and funk band from Philadelphia, which enjoyed some commercial success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, particularly in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFormed by drummer and vocalist \"Fat\" Larry James (August 2, 1949 – December 5, 1987) in 1976, the band included trumpeter/flautist Art Capehart, guitarists Ted Cohen and Tony Middleton, vocalists Freddie Campbell (1952 – January 19, 2013) and Darryl Grant, keyboardist Terry Price, vocalist Alfonso Smith, saxophonist Doug Jones, bassist Larry La Bes, trombonist/alto saxophonist Jimmy Lee, and keyboardist Erskine Williams.\nThe band's biggest hits were \"Act Like You Know\" (which appears on the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City soundtrack) and \"Zoom\", which peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In the latter country, \"Zoom\" peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart in October 1982. The notable success of \"Zoom\" in the United Kingdom resulted in the song being featured on the Christmas 1982 episode of the British TV sitcom Only Fools and Horses titled \"Diamonds Are for Heather\". Fat Larry's Band had three other hits in the UK: \"Center City\", \"Boogie Town\", and \"Lookin' for Love\".\nOn December 5, 1987, James died from a heart attack at the age of 38. As a result, the band folded.\nThe opening drum break from \"Down on the Avenue\", from the band's first album, Feel It (WMOT Records, 1976), has been sampled by many musicians, including N.W.A, Ice-T, Jungle Brothers, Depeche Mode, and Run-D.M.C.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nThe Best of Fat Larry's Band (1994)\nGreatest Hits (1995)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of disco artists (F-K)\nPost-disco\nUltimate Breaks and Beats\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFat Larry's Band discography at Discogs"

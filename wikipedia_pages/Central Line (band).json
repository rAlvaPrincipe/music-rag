    "text": "Central Line was an R&B and soul band from London, England. They recorded two albums with Mercury in the 1980s and had two hit singles in the United States, as well as one top 40 hit in their native country.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nThe band was formed in March 1978, and were signed to Mercury Records early in 1979 by John Stainze. The original founding members were Steve Salvari, Camelle Hinds, Lipson Francis and Henry Defoe. Hinds, Francis and Defoe were previously in a band called TFB (Typical Funk Band), which had contained members that would go on to form Light of the World. TFB also contained the drummer Errol Kennedy, who later joined Imagination. Salvari joined TFB after the departure of trumpeter Kenny Wellington in late 1976 who joined Light of the World, as their second keyboard player and the band members then stood at Salvari, Hinds, Francis, Defoe and Kennedy. The band gigged for about a year then broke up. Francis and Defoe went to work with a bass player who was in Boney M., and Salvari and Hinds staying together to work on various projects.\nIn early 1978, four of the TFB members got back together, and expanded the previous format by recruiting\nLinton Beckles (born Linton Charles Beckles, 17 December 1955 – 3 April 2015) and Kim \"Jake\" Le Mesurier (younger son of English actors John Le Mesurier and Hattie Jacques and brother of longtime Rod Stewart guitarist Robin Le Mesurier). The band decided they needed a new identity, and Defoe came up with the name Central Line, because the band were now running down a central line of funk and soul.\nThey toured with Roy Ayers, Grover Washington, Fat Larry's Band and the Real Thing. Central Line released their debut single, \"Wot We Got Its Hot\" to a good reception, but their second single \"Sticks & Stones\" did not fare so well. They finished the year appearing on BBC Television's, Linda Lewis' Roadshow.\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nOn the week of 3 October 1981, Cash Box had \"Walking in the Sunshine (remix)\" was at no. 1 in the Northeast Dance Music Chart. Two weeks later on the 17th of that month while still at no. 1 on the Northeast Dance Music chart, \"Walking in the Sunshine\" debuted at no. 90 in the Cash Box Top 100 Singles chart.\nTheir self-titled album which was produced by Roy Carter was released on Mercury SRM-1-4033 in late 1981. One of the Feature Picks, the album was reviewed by Cash Box in the magazine's 26 December issue. With the reviewer praising London r&b bands, Central Line was called \"the true cream of the genre\" with \"Walking into Sunshine\" singled out as a testament to that. Other picks were \"Goodbye\" and \"Shake It Up.\" The album also made its debut at no. 62 in the Cash Box Black Contemporary Top 75 Albums chart that week.\nDespite a club hit with \"Walking into Sunshine\" which sold well in the United States, and a UK top 40 hit with \"Nature Boy\", consistent mainstream success eluded them, and they disbanded in August 1984.\n\n\n== Work outside the group ==\nSalvari left in early 1980. After working with Barry White, Robert Palmer and Sheena Easton, he continued in the music industry as a record producer. Mel Gaynor left after their debut album was released to join Simple Minds, and soon after Henri Defoe enjoyed a writing collaboration with Michael Finbarr Murphy.\nBassist Hinds later formed Hindsight with Defoe, and also played bass in the Style Council, as well as forming the Walkers with trumpet player Canute Wellington, and releasing \"(Whatever Happened to) the Party Groove\" / \"Sky's the Limit\" in 1983.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nLe Mesurier died in Spain in the 1990s from an accidental drug overdose.\nBeckles died in London from complications of pneumonia on 3 April 2015. He was 59. His son is footballer Omar Beckles of Leyton Orient.\nLipson Francis died on 29 June 2018.\n\n\n== Original members ==\nSteve Salvari –  Vocals, keyboards\nCamelle Hinds – Vocals, bass\nLipson Francis – Vocals, keyboards\nHenri Defoe – Vocals, guitar\nJake Le Mesurier – Drums, percussion\nLinton Beckles – Vocals, percussion\nMel Gaynor – Drums, percussion\nMichael Finbarr Murphy – Guitars, keyboards\nRoy Carter – Keyboards, guitar\nSteve Jeffries – Keyboards\nGeorge Chandler – Backup vocals\nDee Sealy – Backup vocals\nJimmy Chambers – Backup vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCentral Line discography at Discogs \nCentral Line at Musicglue\nCentral Line at Webstarts\nCentral Line at Facebook"

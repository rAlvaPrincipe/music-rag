    "text": "In Strict Confidence is a German electro-industrial band. Formed in 1989, they were known as Seal of Secrecy until 1992.  In Strict Confidence has been signed to several record labels, including Metropolis Records and WTII Records.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding 1989–2000 ===\nIn Strict Confidence started out as a quartet, but stripped down to a duo (Dennis Ostermann and Jörg Schelte) in 1992, releasing two demos tapes on the way to their debut release 'Cryogenix' on Zoth Ommog in 1996 (the initial pressing of this album sold out in one week), shortly followed by an EP Collapse. The band left Zoth Ommog after releasing follow-up effort Face the Fear in 1998, due to payment disputes. The third album Love Kills! was released on the newly formed and short lived Bloodline label two years later.\n\n\n=== Band Growth 2001–2010 ===\nFounding member Stefan Vesper then re-joined the group in time for Mistrust the Angels in 2002 with subsequent albums Holy and Exile Paradise appearing at two-year intervals. These albums saw the project's sound diversify further, notably with increasing use of female vocals from Antje Schulz, vocalist of the band Chandeen, and the addition of female vocalist Nina de Lianin\n\n\n== Side Projects ==\nDennis Ostermann has a side project called Controlled Fusion.

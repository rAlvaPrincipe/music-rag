    "text": "Nailbomb is a heavy metal band formed in 1993 as a side project by Brazilian musician Max Cavalera (then-the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of Sepultura) and British musician Alex Newport of Fudge Tunnel. They played a combination of primarily industrial metal and thrash metal. The band recorded one studio album, Point Blank, and played a warmup live performance and their only official gig for 29 years at the 1995 Dynamo Open Air Festival two days later, after which the band disbanded. The band reunited for the first time in 29 years in Tempe, Arizona in November 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nNailbomb hosted other musicians to play guest spots, including D.H. Peligro (Dead Kennedys), Max Cavalera's brother Igor Cavalera (Sepultura co-founder), and guitarist Dino Cazares (co-founder and guitarist of Fear Factory). Nailbomb's second album, Proud to Commit Commercial Suicide, was a live recording capturing the band's appearance at the 1995 Dynamo Open Air Festival in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.\nThe project was largely defunct for over two decades, with no intention of the band ever reuniting or releasing any new material, until Cavalera announced in April 2017 he would play the entire Point Blank album on tour with his band Soulfly. Newport was not involved in the performances, citing his busy schedule as the reason. Instead, Cavalera drafted his son Igor Cavalera Jr., who had previously toured as a bassist and backing vocalist for Soulfly, to perform Newport's vocal and keyboard/sampler parts.\nOn August 14, 2024, Max Cavalera announced that Nailbomb would reunite for its first show in 29 years as part of the \"Max Cavalera Dynasty Show\", which took place at the Marquee Theatre in Tempe, Arizona on November 9. In addition to Cavalera, the lineup for this show was his son Igor and Travis Stone both on guitar, bassist Johny Chow, sampler Alex Cha and drummer Adam Jarvis. In early November 2024, it was announced Nailbomb would be playing the Alcatraz festival in Kortrijk, Belgium in August 2025.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Members ===\nMax Cavalera (Sepultura, Soulfly, Cavalera Conspiracy) – vocals, rhythm guitar, bass, samples\nAlex Newport (Fudge Tunnel, Theory of Ruin) – vocals, lead guitar, bass, samples\n\n\n=== Session members ===\nIgor Cavalera (Sepultura, Cavalera Conspiracy) – drums\nAndreas Kisser (Sepultura, De La Tierra, Kisser Klan) – lead guitar\nDino Cazares (Fear Factory, Brujeria, Divine Heresy) – rhythm guitar\n\n\n=== Live members ===\nIgor Cavalera (Sepultura, Cavalera Conspiracy) – drums (1995)\nD.H.

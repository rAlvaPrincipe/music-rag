Although it was released in 1999, it contains no material more recent than on U2's 1991 album Achtung Baby. The album was re-released on June 23, 2003 under the title The Hits of U2.\nThe original cover art of the album is a parody on the cover of U2's 1988 album Rattle and Hum.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nUnlike previous tribute albums by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, such as the 1996 tribute to Pink Floyd, Pride is entirely instrumental and contains no lyrics.

    "text": "Metavari is an American electronic music project led by Nathaniel David Utesch in Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom 2008-2012, Metavari released two EP's, one full-length, and showcased at the SXSW Music Festival in Austin, TX as a post-rock oriented full band. During this time the band shared the stage with many notable acts in the post-rock genre including This Will Destroy You, Maserati, Tortoise, The Appleseed Cast, Lymbyc Systym and other indie groups such as Bear In Heaven, Anamanaguchi and Titus Andronicus.\nMetavari launched a Kickstarter in 2012 to fund the release of their sophomore full-length. The record was eventually materialized in 2015 with Nathaniel David Utesch as primary composer and producer, saw their departure from the post-rock genre, and was Metavari's debut as an electronic music project. The crowd-sourced LP is titled, Moonless, and was self-released February 2015.\nSince 2015, Metavari has released two records with Mind Over Matter Records (Los Angeles); Oh Diane in September 2015; and Tetra A.D. in February 2017. \"Oh Diane\" is a tribute to the television series, Twin Peaks, and was featured on the compilation, The Next Peak, Vol III.\nMetavari re-scored Fritz Lang’s Metropolis as a commission from Fort Wayne, Indiana’s Cinema Center for Art House Theater Day 2016. The re-score was released worldwide on One Way Static Records for Record Store Day 2017, and distributed in the United States by Light in the Attic Records. Two years later, Metavari released another official Record Store Day title with One Way Static/Light in the Attic. Titled, ABSURDA, the record was scored to a collection of work spanning the career of David Lynch and doubled as Metavari's fourth studio release. \n\n\n== Members ==\nIn addition to Nathaniel, live shows are often accompanied by the bassist from Metavari’s original line-up, Ty Brinneman.\nList of past and present members and collaborators:\n\nNathaniel David Utesch — synths, vocals, programming, alto saxophone, drums\nTy Brinneman — bass guitar\nTommy Cutter — guitar, programming\nSimon Lesser — guitar\nAndrew McComas — drums, guitar\nKyle Steury — guitar, synths, programming\nColin Boyd — drums, percussion\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nBe One of Us and Hear No Noise (2009, Crossroads of America Records)\nBe One of Us and Hear No Noise (Extended Edition) (2009, Friend of Mine Records)\nMoonless (2015, Vital Shores)\nMetropolis (An Original Re-Score by Metavari) (2017, One Way Static Records)\nSymmetri (2017, One Way Static Records)\nABSURDA (2019, One Way Static Records)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nAmbling EP (2008, Self-Released)\nStudies vol.1: Loosen the Bands (2010, Crossroads of America Records)\nTetra A.D.

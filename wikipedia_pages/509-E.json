    "text": "509-E was a Brazilian rap group formed by Dexter and Afro-X when they were incarcerated in Carandiru Penitentiary. The group dissolved in 2003 when the musicians decided to follow solo careers.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe group emerged in the Carandiru prison where Dexter and Afro-X shared the same cell and the gift of writing raps. Soon after the launch of the first song, \"powder keg\" 509-E had great success and the two artists began to produce new music. In 2000, they released their debut album,Proverbs 13, with special guests of Mano Brown, Edy Rock, MV Bill and DJ Hum. The highlight of the CD was the track \"Eighth Angel\", sung by Dexter.\nThe group was at its peak when after an interview on Rede Globo, the pair were targeted by Brazilian authorities for speaking out. After the uprising that resulted in the closing of the Carandiru penitentiary 509-E was banned from playing shows in the street by the police due to their advocacy. After a time, Afro-X won the Freedom 509-E released his second and last work,LL DC (2002 after Christ). The two members began to fall out and the group ended in 2003.\nRegarding the end of the group Dexter states,\n\n\"The 509-E over a number of reasons. A group of RAP is like a church, from the moment you do not agree with that doctrine and that bothers you, change your church, but their God will remain the same and is within your heart. You will not change the board, but its essence will remain the same. After the Afro-X was the street, some things have changed and of course we move away from each other. He went on to talk about things that were living in the moment, which is natural. And I kept talking about the same things we had talked about the other discs, however, another way, of course. Ideologically speaking, we have drifted too, the cheap began to bother me and I opted for the end of the group.\"\nCurrently, Dexter follows a solo career and has released four albums, Afro-X remained a time in rap, moved away and came back again, became nationally known for married Simony, and is currently an educator.\nIn 2009, it released a documentary about the 509-E, called Between Light and Shadow, directed by Luciana Burlamaqui. It investigates violence in Brazil from the formation of Dexter and Afro-X in the Carandiru. Released in theaters on November 27, 2009 in November 14 received first prize: won 4 ª Mostra Cinema and Human Rights in South America\n\n\n== Discography ==\nProvérbios 13(2000)\nMMII DC (2002 Depois de Cristo) (2002)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n509-E at Last.fm"

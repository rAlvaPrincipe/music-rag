    "text": "Koven, sometimes stylized as KO·êØEN or KOVEN., are an English electronic dance music duo made up of producer Max Rowat and vocalist Katie Boyle. They are especially known for their drum and bass and dubstep, but also make trap, future bass, house, pop and other styles. The duo are signed to Monstercat and hail from London, England.\nRowat started the project in 2011 and had several vocalists prior to Katie Boyle joining in 2014. They have guested on BBC Radio 1 shows including BBC Radio 1 Dance Presents with Hybrid Minds. They released their debut album Butterfly Effect in 2020, which was nominated for Best Album at the 2020 Drum & Bass Arena awards.\n\n\n== History ==\nMax Rowat began the Koven project in 2011, posting his debut free EP \"Wake You Up\" on SoundCloud, with the title track including vocals by Kate Ashton. Rowat and Ashton released two more songs together: \"Take It All\" with Modestep and the project's streaming debut \"More Than You\". The duo also supported Modestep on their 2013 tour, before Ashton left the project later that year. Meanwhile, vocalist Katie Boyle was performing under the alias Katie's Ambition, and had provided vocals for several artists including Hybrid Minds, Rollz and High Maintenance.\nIn early 2014, they announced that Boyle would be joining Koven, and released their first single \"Another Home\". This was succeeded by a two part EP titled \"Hereinafter\", released on Viper Recordings. A follow up EP titled \"Sometimes We Are\" was released in 2015.\nKoven made their debut on Canadian electronic music imprint Monstercat in 2016 with the song \"Silence\", followed by a 4 track EP titled \"Come To Light\", released on November 11 that year. They continued to release on Monstercat, with their 4th EP \"Reality Reach\" being released in 2018. In October 2019, they announced their debut album \"Butterfly Effect\", and the lead single \"Your Pain\" was released in November of 2019. The album was released on 13 March 2020. A Deluxe edition was released almost a year later in March 2021, including 3 new original tracks and remixes by several artists, including The Prototypes, Fox Stevenson and Grafix.\nIn 2022, they announced a two-part EP titled \"Higher Ground\", with part 1 being released on Monstercat on 4 August 2022 and part 2 on 2 March 2023.\nKoven have performed at some of the biggest music festivals in the world, including Tomorrowland, Glastonbury and Reading and Leeds. Since 2018, Boyle has performed alone due to Rowat suffering from travel anxiety, and offers a hybrid DJ set alongside live vocals.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nRetrospective (Viper, 2018)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nHereinafter, Pt. 1  (Viper, 2014)\nHereinafter, Pt. 2  (Viper, 2014)\nSometimes We Are (Viper, 2015)\nCome to Light (Monstercat, 2016)\nReality Reach (Monstercat, 2018)\nHigher Ground (Part 1) (Monstercat, 2022)\nHigher Ground (Part 2) (Monstercat, 2023)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

    "text": "The Astoria Symphony Orchestra is an orchestra of professional musicians based in Astoria, Queens, in New York City. The orchestra performs at least six programs annually. The Astoria Symphony is the only semi-professional orchestra that regularly serves western Queens.\nThe orchestra was founded by conductor Silas Nathaniel Huff in 2002, and performed fifteen concerts in its inaugural season. The Astoria Symphony's first performance in September 2003 under Huff's baton included Felix Mendelssohn's The Hebrides, Mozart's Flute Concerto No. 1, and Haydn's Symphony No. 103 (\"Drumroll\"). Since then, the orchestra has performed a wide range of repertoire including Vivaldi's Gloria, Schubert's Unfinished Symphony, Debussy's Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun (reduced orchestration), Brahms' A German Requiem, Beethoven's Choral Fantasy, Symphonies No. 8 and 9, Piano Concertos 3 and 5, and Egmont Overture, Stravinsky's Firebird, Ives' The Unanswered Question, Lukas Foss' Elegy for Anne Frank, and many more, including a number of world premieres. These performances have taken place in LaGuardia Performing Arts Center (LaGuardia Community College, Long Island City), Symphony Space (Upper West Side), Riverside Church, Central Park's Naumburg Bandshell, and the Manhattan Jewish Community Center, among others.\nThe Astoria Symphony is the flagship ensemble of the Astoria Music Society, which also includes the Lost Dog New Music Ensemble.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAstoria Symphony Orchestra discography at MusicBrainz\nSilas Nathaniel Huff discography at MusicBrainz\n\"Astoria Symphony Orchestra: A gem in New York Cityâ€™s outer boroughs\" by Kay Kempin, Bachtrack, November 22, 2011\nAstoria Symphony Orchestra at brownstoner.com\nAstoria Symphony on Twitter"

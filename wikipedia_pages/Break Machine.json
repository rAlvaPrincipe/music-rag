In 1981, he recorded a single, \"Searching Rap\" under the name 'Bon Rock'.

In 1983, together with Fred Zarr, they released \"Street Dance\",  which was an international hit and one of the earliest mainstream breakthroughs for hip hop.\n\"Street Dance\" peaked at #3 on the UK Singles Chart in March 1984, and was the 39th best-selling single of that year. It hit #1 in Sweden and Norway. In Germany, it was the 78th best-selling single of 1984. It charted #11 in Italy. \"Street Dance\" saw its strongest chart performance in Norway, where it was #1 for five weeks. In France, the song reached #1 for two weeks, selling over a million copies and becoming the 86th best-selling single of all time according to a list released in 2004 by the Syndicat National de l'Edition Phonographique\nSubsequent singles \"Break Dance Party\" and \"Are You Ready?\" both reached the UK chart, peaking at number 9 and number 27 respectively.

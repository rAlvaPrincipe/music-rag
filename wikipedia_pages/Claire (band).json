    "text": "Claire is an electropop band from Munich, Germany.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 2012, three musicians and producers Matthias Hauck, Heller Nepomuk and Florian Kiermaier found Josie-Claire Buerkle to sing for a film project with their shared recording studios. This was a result of her participation in the TV show The Voice of Germany the year before, and her subsequent search for a band. Out of their film project emerged the band. The fifth member of the band, drummer Fridolin Achten, joined shortly after.\nThey had immediate Internet success with their first volume, the EP Games, helping them to get a recording contract with Capitol Records, part of Universal Music Group. In the summer of 2013, they had an initial moderate success with the title song of their EP in the German charts. At the end of September they released their debut LP, entitled The Great Escape, which debuted at number 38 on the album charts.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nJosie-Claire Bürkle – vocals\nMatthias Hauck – keyboards\nNepomuk Heller – keyboards\nFlorian Kiermaier – guitar\nFridolin Achten – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Pioneers\" (2012)\n\"Games\" (2013)\n\"The Next Ones to Come\" (2013)\n\"Overdrive\" (2013)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nClaire discography at Discogs"

    "text": "U.N. is a Harlem, New York City-based hip hop duo formed by Cam'ron and Vado in 2009. The group came to formation after Cam'ron had a falling-out with fellow Harlem rapper and co-founder of the Diplomats, Jim Jones in 2007.\nThe duo released the mixtape Boss of All Bosses in 2009, followed by its sequel Boss of All Bosses 2 the following year. Afterwards, the U.N. released Boss of All Bosses 2.5, an expansion of the first two original mixtapes, released on May 12, 2010. The duo's debut album, Heat in Here Vol. 1 was released later that same month, through Asylum Records and Warner Records. It reached number 133 on the Billboard 200, and contained guest appearances from rappers Young Chris, Gucci Mane and Felony Fame. A sequel, Gunz n' Butta was released in April 2011 independently through Diplomatic Man and Entertainment One; it performed slightly better commercially at number 77 on the Billboard 200. It spawned the singles \"Speakin' in Tungs\", which peaked at number 82 on Billboard's Hip-Hop/R&B Songs chart, as well as the similarly received \"Hey Muma\". \nCam'ron has since temporarily made amends with Jones in 2010 and renewed focus on his solo career, while Vado briefly signed with DJ Khaled's We the Best Music Group to pursue a solo career.\nThey reunited in 2019.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

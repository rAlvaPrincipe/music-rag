    "text": "Dungeonesse is an American collaboration between songwriter and producer Jon Ehrens (White Life, Art Department) and singer Jenn Wasner (Wye Oak, Flock of Dimes) out of Baltimore, Maryland. The project was born through their mutual love for Top 40 and R&B and the mechanics behind a hit song. The pair began creating songs long-distance between Los Angeles and wherever Wasner was touring. The group signed to the independent record label Secretly Canadian in 2012, and since have released one single, \"Drive You Crazy\" b/w \"Private Party.\" Their self-titled debut album was  released by Secretly Canadian on May 14, 2013.\nAccording to Ehrens and Wasner, the music is equally focused on sonic choices and lyrics. The songs have been heavily influenced by the music of the 1990s, as both members of the duo call themselves \"90's children.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2012: Secretly Canadian ===\nJon Ehrens and Jenn Wasner began collaborating on music remotely when Wasner was touring with another group.

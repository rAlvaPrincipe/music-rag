    "text": "Neon Blonde was a supergroup consisting of Johnny Whitney and Mark Gajadhar from The Blood Brothers. They were based in Kirkland, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. The two expanded beyond The Blood Brothers' sound by utilizing a more electronic-based sound, which included electroclash and dance-punk. Neon Blonde's music drew from many genres including post-hardcore, and experimental rock (influenced by their band The Blood Brothers and Velvet Underground's art rock), who have also teamed up with Blood Brothers members to create Head Wound City), and a more electroclash sound. Their music also featured rapping, and rapped vocals in an alternative hip hop style.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHeadlines (Dim Mak Records, 2005)\nChandeliers in the Savannah (Dim Mak Records, 2005)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Myspace\nDim Mak Records\nDim Mak profile\nNeon Blonde Interview, Fall 2005\n\n\n== References =="

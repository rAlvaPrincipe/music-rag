    "text": "7icons ( or Indonesian pronunciation: [aykens]) is an Indonesian girl group formed on 28 October 28, 2010. The group originally consisted of seven members: A.Tee, Gc, Linzy, Mezty, Natly, PJ, and Vanila who departed in 2013; T-Sha was then added to the group after an audition. The group was disbanded in 2014 and reunited in 2020 with members Gc, Mezty, PJ, Vanila, and T-Sha.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2010–2012: Beginnings ===\nThe group was formed by friends from three big cities in Indonesia:\n\nSurabaya (Angel/A.Tee, Vanila, PJ, Natly)\nJakarta (Linzy, Grace/Gc)\nBandung (Mezty)\nMembers of the group came from various professions: model, fashion designer, dancer, presenter, teacher, college student, and disc jockey. After the initial idea for the group was suggested by A.Tee, they decided to move to Jakarta and bought a small apartment as their headquarters. Whilst searching for a music label, 7icons hired a personal dance coach and took vocal lessons, all of which were self-financed. As the group had large expenditure (for coaches, studio, etc.) and no income, Mezty sold her car to help the group's finance. They later signed a contract with Keci Music.\n7icons officially debuted with their first single \"Playboy\" on 18 April 18, 2011 in music show \"Derings\" on Trans TV. 7icons also starred in their own teen drama series Go Go Girls on Trans TV, with \"Playboy\" as its opening and closing theme. The single was well received, reaching number two on the national music chart in its first week, and then became a TVC jingle in their first TV commercial with Telkom Indonesia. The group's schedule became tighter as their popularity grew and they performed almost weekly.\nTheir second single \"Jealous\" was released later that year, along with \"Penjaga Hati\". They held a mini-concert, themed as a pyjama party, as the launch of their mini-album, \"Lovable\". Their fan base grew through Indonesia; a fanclub, \"ICONIA\", was established by their fans. Until the end of the year, 7icons had successfully performed throughout Indonesia. 7icons was the only female group who performed at the concert Road to 2011 Southeast Asian Games, held in Borobudur. To close the year, the group released \"The Journey of Love\", the first full album from an Indonesian girl band, on 21 December 2011. The album is not sold by conventional methods, but via special booths in Naughty Accessories.\nIn 2012, The Journey of Love was marketed by Naughty Accessories. The group approved the fanclub \"ICONIA\" to become their official fan club, \"Official ICONIA\". 7icons also played as guests on several private television stations in Indonesia. They had the opportunity to collaborate with Bebi Romeo through his song \"Cinta Cuma Satu\", on the album Bebi Romeo Mega Hits, received several awards in the fields of music and appearance, and were appointed as \"Ambassador(s) of the Environment\" 2012. 7icons also had the opportunity to do a concert collaboration between countries, held in Gangnam, South Korea. They performed \"Playboy\" and \"Cinta Cuma Satu\", with \"Cinta Cuma Satu\" translated into Korean.\n\n\n=== 2013: Vanila's departure and America release (2013) ===\nIn early January 2013, Vanila announced she's departing the group on her wedding day, 31 January 2013. The group begin an audition in February for a new member and T-Sha was later selected to replace Vanila. The group got their second own television series, Cinta 7 Susun, a musical-comedy soap opera. The series tells the story of a fictionalized version of the group as they struggle to debut. Vanila appeared on its first three episodes, while new member T-Sha was introduced later on the series. The series premiered on 28 January 2013, three days prior to Vanila's official departure, and concluded on 10 May 2013.\nOn the same year, they underwent an image change with the theme of \"rebirth\". The idea was to go from the reborn phase of life to meet the mature phase. The concept was launched simultaneously with the launch of their first American single, \"Outta Diz World\" in March 2013. The single was included on 7icons' compilation album, which is their second album and the first album to be released in the U.S.\nThe single \"Cinta 7 Susun\" was also a winner in the television musical program \"TOP POP\", earning \"Top Song of the Day\" on 28 May 2013. \"Playboy (Bali mix)\" won \"Top Song of the Day\" on 12 June 2013, and single \"Cinta Cuma satu (Korean Mix)\" did so on 5 July 2013. In a \"Suka Suka Uya\" (a talk show on the MNCTV channel) interview with Uya Kuya, Pj (Cute Icon) revealed 7icons's term \"Captain Class\", their term for the leader of the group; PJ is the Captain in 7icons. 7icons covered Feliz Navidad, included on the Keci Music Christmas Songs Compilation.\n\n\n=== 2014–2015: Disbandment and rebranding to the Icons ===\nFollowing issues with Keci Music in early 2014, 7icons decided to left the label and started working self-managed. On 19 August 2014, they released their first single under their own label, \"Mana Tahan\", an electropop dance single created by Andi from the group 'Beage' and Dwi Andri.\nHowever, on November, PJ announced the disbandment of the group following the departure of A.Tee, T-Sha, and Linzy. It was also announced the remaining members will rebrand the group as The Icons (stylized as 7he Icons). According to an interview, the group will change their musical style from K-pop to Western with 1980s and 1990s appearances and musical style. It was also revealed that the group is producing their first single. However, in 2015, Mezty announced her departure from the group, citing that other members were abandoning the group.\n\n\n=== 2016–2017: The formation of Icons ===\nFormer members Grace Fransin (Gc) and Natalia Shasanti (Natly), along with Instagram celebrity Marisha Chacha, formed a creative pop girlband, Icons. The group is said to be a \"reincarnation\" of 7Icons. Their sole single, \"Playboy Beautiful\", was produced in America and released on 21 March 2016. The group was last seen on mid 2017.\n\n\n=== 2020–2021: Reunion ===\nThe group announced their reunion on 28 October 2020 with a new single to be released. The reunion involves PJ, Gc, Mezty, Vanila, and T-Sha. Former member A.Tee won't be coming back due to her contract with another label, while Linzy is now married and Natly wears hijab. The single \"Night and Day\" and its music video was released on 25 November 2020. They also launched their own beauty product, Iconskin, at the peak of Shopee 12.12 Birthday Sale.\nTheir first appearance after a 6-year vacuum was on Pagi-Pagi Ambyar, a variety program which aired on Trans TV.

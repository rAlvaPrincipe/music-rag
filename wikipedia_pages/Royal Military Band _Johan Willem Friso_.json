    "text": "The Royal Military Band \"Johan Willem Friso\" (Dutch: Koninklijke Militaire Kapel \"Johan Willem Friso), also informally called the Band of the Royal Netherlands Army or the Johan Willem Friso Military Band is a Dutch military unit in the Koninklijke Landmacht (Dutch Army) which is the seniormost of all the military bands in the Netherlands Armed Forces, as well as the oldest of the four professional bands currently in existence in the army. It provides musical support for ceremonial events of national importance involving the army, the government, and the Dutch royal house. The repertoire of the band ranges from a variety of different genres, including military marches and contemporary/classical arrangements of symphonic music.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn July 7, 1829, William I of the Netherlands ordered that a music corps be established for the then Grenadier Regiment with 18 professional musicians and 10 conscript youths. The first public performance took place on 8 April 1830 on the occasion of the sixth birthday of Princess Sophie daughter of the William II. After the retirement of François Dunkler as bandmaster in 1849, he was succeeded by his son François Dunkler Jr, a clarinet player in the 11th Infantry Division. Dunkler Jr. Dunkler brought many merits and fame to the band over the course of the following 10 years, collectively winning second place at a musical competition in Paris. William III recognized personally these accomplishments by granting Dunkler Jr. the honorary title of Director of Music in 1861. \nUnder the direction of Nicolaas Arie Bouwman, the band made a concert trip to Ghent, Belgium, on the occasion of the World Exhibition of 1913. The band was also present when Wilhelmina returned to her residence (Anneville) in 1945 following the allied victory in the Second World War. During the immediate post-war period, the focal points of military music were centered around wind orchestras. In addition, military tattoos were developed and as a result, the band gained more close international contacts, specifically in the NATO and European Union sphere. The country became widely known for the large military tattoos that were held annually. In connection with this, Anne Posthumus, who had previously been bandmaster of the Music Corps for the Troops in Suriname, became director of the band. \nPosthumus was succeeded on 1 March 1978 by Jan van Ossenbruggen, who was then succeeded on 1 April 1986 by Pierre Kuijpers van Ossenbruggen as the first conductor of the Royal Military Band in The Hague. During his tenure, he began efforts for the introduction of symphonic wind music, creating many CD recordings with the band. The Royal Military Band \"Johan Willem Friso\" was created on January 1, 2005, after a period of reorganization of military music organizations, which led to the disbandment of four then existing bands within the Royal Netherlands Army. It was a result of a merger between The Hague band and the Assen band of the Johan Wilem Frisco Infantry Regiment. In addition the band also welcomed musicians from the Brass Band of the Rifles' Guard Regiment, also fused into the RMB as a result of the merger of that regiment with the Grenadier Guards Regiment.\n\n\n== Musical support ==\n\nThe Royal Military Band \"Johan Willem Friso\" serves primarily as the musical accompaniment at military events and ceremonial occasions within and outside the armed forces. Its musicians give concerts, tattoos and shows at home and abroad. The band provides musical support to the Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment alongside the Traditional Corps of Drums of the Grenadier Regiment and the Rifles' Guards Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps (both formations staffed by veterans and reservists), due to the few number of military bands in active service in the Dutch Army, moreover it is assisted by the Veterans' Drum and Bugle Corps of the Johan Wilem Frisco Infantry Regiment. Aside from being the official band of the Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment it supports the activities of other regiments of the Army and of the Corps of Cadets, Koninklijke Militaire Academie, alternately with the brass bands of the RNA.\nIt supports the following annual and occasional events in the country:\n\nKoningsdag\nPrinsjesdag\nVeteranendag\nBevrijdingsdag\nDag van de Strijdkrachten\nState Visits (Staatsbezoek)\nPresentation of credentials (Presentatie van de geloofsbrief)\nRoyal weddings (Koninklijke Huwelijken)\nState funeral (Staatsbegrafenis)\nInaugurations (Inhuldiging)\nChange of command (Verandering van commando)\nMilitary tattoos, Veterans Day and concerts (including Liberation Day concerts)\n\n\n== Organization ==\n\nThe band consists of 50 professional musicians who fall under the woodwind, brass and percussion sections. In addition, smaller ensembles can also be formed from the band, such as the following:\n\nMarching Band – This is used during parades and events where the band is required to stay standing up for a long period of time. They wear the uniform of the former Grenadier Guards Regiment.\nBig Band – It plays at official receptions and concerts.

The two met in Somerset, UK, while \"digging through crates at the local record store\". Clement is also a member of James Lavelle's Unkle project.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1998, Psychonauts released a mix album, Time Machine, on Mo' Wax. In 2015, Fact placed it at number 35 on the \"50 Best Trip-Hop Albums of All Time\" list.\nIn 2003, the duo released their first studio album, Songs for Creatures, on International DeeJay Gigolo Records. John Bush of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, calling it \"one of the best records to appear from a former Mo' Wax act in several years.\" Neesh Asghar of The Guardian described it as \"a gorgeous record showcasing cinematic soundscapes and seductive ethereal ambience alongside pastoral folk-pop songs and electro disco.\" The album was re-released in 2010. In a review of the album's reissue, Matthew Bennett of Clash called it \"a complete dance album that's rarely been surpassed in the last six years.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nSongs for Creatures (2003, International DeeJay Gigolo Records)\n\n\n=== Mix albums ===\nTime Machine (1998, Mo' Wax)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Hot Blood / Invading Space (Outer Descent)\" (1999, Mo' Wax)\n\"Fear Is Real / Hips for Scotland\" (2003, International DeeJay Gigolo Records)\n\"World Keeps Turning\" (2004, International DeeJay Gigolo Records)\n\"Take Control\" (2010, International DeeJay Gigolo Records)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Psychonauts at AllMusic\nPsychonauts discography at Discogs"

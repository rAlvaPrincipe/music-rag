    "text": "Microstoria is an experimental electronic ensemble from DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.\nMicrostoria was founded in 1994 by Markus Popp (of Oval) and Jan St. Werner (of Mouse on Mars). Their first full-length arrived in 1995, released in Europe on the Mille Plateaux label and reissued in America on Thrill Jockey. Three further efforts followed on both labels, and the pair continued working together through 2002. According to Popp, as compared to Oval, \"Microstoria does focus much more on the playfulness of the overall approach,\" incorporating warmer sounds.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nInit Ding (Mille Plateaux/Thrill Jockey, 1995)\nsnd (Mille Plateaux/Thrill Jockey, 1996)\nReprovisers (Mille Plateaux/Thrill Jockey, 1997)\nModel 3, Step 2 (Mille Plateaux/Thrill Jockey, 2000)\nInvisible Architecture 3 (Audiosphere Records, 2002)\nImprovisers (Sonig Records, 2002)\n\n\n== References ==\nSean Cooper, Microstoria at Allmusic"

    "text": "The Gass was a rock band formed in May 1965 by Robert Tench, Godfrey McLean, and Errol McLean. They were managed by Rik Gunnell and Active Management. The band fused melodies with soul, Latin influences, blues and progressive rock often employing complex rhythms with an eclectic mix of other influences.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1960s-1969 ===\nAfter forming in the early 1960s as The Senators then becoming the Creators they became known as The Gass in 1965 with the original line up of Robert Tench as bass player and lead vocalist,  percussionist Errol McLean with his brother drummer and vocalist Godfrey McLean. Saxophonist Humphrey Oka and guitarist Alan Roskams were also added to the lineup. Tench soon became began contributing guitar and keyboard parts as well. As their music progressed the line up changed and between 1965 and 1967 they released singles on the Parlophone and CBS labels.\nThe band played at clubs and venues throughout the UK and at fashionable music venues in London's Soho such as The Ad Lib club, The Flamingo and the Bag O'Nails. Eric Burdon sang with them at The Scotch of St James where they were employed as the house band and Jimi Hendrix jammed with them. During 1968 they were supporting bands such as Led Zeppelin. In 1969 they became the house band for the rock musical Catch My Soul-Rock Othello produced by Jack Good and their participation was billed as 'music interpreted by Gass'.\n\n\n=== 1970-1971 ===\nBy this period the band were known simply as Gass and they released their first album Juju (1970) which featured guitarist Peter Green. In the same year Godfrey McLean appeared on Peter Green's End of the Game (1970). Gass were also featured on the album Catch My Soul (1971), which was recorded with the original cast of the UK stage production of Catch My Soul-Rock Othello.\nIn 1971 the band recorded the single \"Something's Got To Change Your Ways\" which was released the Polydor label. Pete Masden mentions in his book Funk guitar and Bass, that during this period Godfrey McLean and Tench performed at regular jam sessions with other musicians at Ronnie Scott's club. These sessions led to an embryonic line up for the fusion band Gonzalez.\n\n\n=== Post disbanding ===\nIn May 1971 Tench joined The Jeff Beck Group and Gass finally disbanded. Godfrey McLean recorded with Brian Auger and The Oblivion Express. Delisle Harper who was the band's bass player in a later lineup appeared with Tench on Freddie King's Burglar (1974) also Larger than Life (1975).

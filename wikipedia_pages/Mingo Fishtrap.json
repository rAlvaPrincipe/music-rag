Infectious tunes and plentiful chops figure to make for a crowd-pleasing evening.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1997: Succotash\n2000: From the Private Bag\n2004: EP2\n2005: Yesterday\n2006: Live at the Granada\n2008: EP3\n2010: In the Meantime\n2014: On Time\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website"

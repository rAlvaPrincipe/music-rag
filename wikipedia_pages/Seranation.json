Shortly after, the met up with lead singer J. Carter Gleason (or simply \"J\") who auditioned for them by singing the Sublime song \"Garden Grove\". Next, they needed a name to represent the members diverse musical backgrounds. It was J. Carter who came up with the band's name. After singing about a co-worker named Sarah. He kept singing, \"It's like a Sarah-nation!\" And that was it, \"Seranation\" was born out of the word \"serenade\". Later on, they added Josh Baron on drums and Beard Bruce on keyboard and saxophone, as well as guitarist Colin Smith.\n\n\n=== Island Thinkin (2015) ===\nThe band recorded their first full-length studio album, Island Thinkin on September 17, 2015,  as a self-produced release.

The 10-track follow-up was released on Pepper's LAW Records, working with Josh Saldate and Greg Shields, lead singer of label-mates Kash'd Out, recording at Sound Lounge Studios. J. Carter explains the album's name, \"We were trying to inspire people. When you're down and out, keep pushing through. We want to spread good vibes with it. We want people to know they're capable of making their dreams happen, just as we are doing the same thing. It's us really committing to living the dream.\" The band really brings their \"Florida vibes\" with them in this album. Adam added, \"There is a deeper message than just the Floridian lifestyle, a responsibility when creating music.\" The band also added guitarist Matt Knabe after Smith left.\n\n\n=== Compilation and singles (2019–2023) ===\nIn 2021, Seranation was one of several reggae rock and punk bands on The House That Bradley Built, a charity compilation honoring Sublime's lead singer Bradley Nowell, helping musicians with substance abuse. They covered Sublime's song \"Ebin\" on the Deluxe Edition which was released on January 12, 2021.\nThe band also recorded and released several singles over the years, along with music videos. Some singles include, \"Sweet Tempation\", \"Dangerous\", and \"Surfboard\", which were co-written and produced by Rome Ramirez of Sublime with Rome, which were released under his own record label, Fresh Goods.\n\n\n=== Meant To Be (2024) ===\nOn September 26, 2024, Seranation released their second full-length studio album, Meant To Be on their record label, Livin' the Dream Records.

For Bianca it was a mix of artists from the 70's; from Jimi Hendrix to their contemporaries like The Expendables and Slightly Stoopid. J's was inspired by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and especially Sublime whose CD was in constant rotation that he listened to a 'million times', which he said \"reawakened his dream\" of becoming a musician. Adam got a chance to meet his greatest inspiration; guitarist Raul Bianchi from The Expendables who taught him how to perfect his craft as a musician.\n\n\n== Lineup ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nJ.

    "text": "Ferocious Dog are an English folk punk band from Warsop, Nottinghamshire, England. The band has headlined tours of the UK and Europe, performed in Dubai, festivals such as Bearded Theory, Alchemy, Deerstock, Farmer Phil's Festival, Splendour and Beautiful Days, and toured in support of New Model Army, The Levellers and The Wonder Stuff. In 2015 the band played in the Field of Avalon at Glastonbury Festival.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe band released a number of EPs before a first album on Weird Sounds in 2013, described by Louder Than War as \"startlingly good, and so it should be, it’s been many years in the making\".  The album has been reviewed positively in both folk and metal sources.\nOn 11 February 2015, Ferocious Dog announced that they would be releasing a second album, From Without, this was funded by fans pre-ordering the album in advance.  It was produced by Matt Terry and mastered by Al Scott.  It was released in October 2015 after single releases of \"Ruby Bridges\" in June 2015 and \"Slow Motion Suicide\" in August 2015.\nTouring the new material started at The Bodega in Nottingham on 7 March 2015, the first live appearance with the new line-up including Leslie Carter on guitar and Scott Walters on drums -  it sold out in 22 minutes. This kicked off a busy year of touring and festivals, culminating in a sell-out home town gig at Rock City in Nottingham.  Ferocious Dog are the first independent act to sell-out the venue in its 35-year history. The band encouraged those attending to bring items for a local food bank to the gig, completely swamping the room Rock City had put aside to store them in the process.  The gig was filmed and recorded, and released as a CD and DVD.  2016 ended with a UK and European tour supporting The Levellers, including shows in the Netherland and Germany.  Further shows in the Netherlands were played in February 2017.\n\n\n== Fans ==\nFans of Ferocious Dog are affectionately referred to as 'Hell Hounds' - taking their name from the Ferocious Dog song.  \n\n\n== Lee Bonsall ==\nPivotal to the ethos of Ferocious Dog is the fate of Ken's son Lee.  Lee served in Afghanistan from the age of 18, and upon rejoining civilian life took his own life in 2012 at the age of just 24, unable to overcome the post traumatic stress disorder he was suffering  stemming from one of his friends being killed by a sniper.  Lee is commemorated in the songs \"The Glass, Lee's Tune\" and \"A Verse for Lee\" on their first album.  This gave rise to the Lee Bonsall Memorial Fund which is a constant focus for fundraising and awareness building by the band.  Lee's story was featured in the BBC documentary Broken by Battle. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs and singles ===\n\"Ferocious Dog\" (2011)\n\"Hell Hounds\" (2012)\n\"Revolution\" (2012)\n\"Ruby Bridges\" (2015)\n\"Slow Motion Suicide\" (2015)\n\"American Dream\" (2017)\n\"The Landscape Artist\" (2018)\n\"Psychedelic Spin\" with Dr. Peacock (2019)\n\n\n=== Other media ===\nLive at Rock City (CD/DVD) (2016)\nLive at the Rescue Rooms (CD/DVD) (2018)\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nKen Bonsall - Vocals, Acoustic Guitar (1988–present)\nJamie Burney - Violin (2022 –present)\nKyle Peters - Electric Guitar (2010 - 2014, 2022-present)\nLuke Grainger - Percussion (2022 -present)\nNick Wragg - Bassist (2022 -present)\nSam Wood - Banjo, Mandolin, Bouzouki, Acoustic Guitar, Whistles, Accordion (2021-present)\n\n\n=== Former ===\nDan Booth - Violin (1988–2022)\nDave Drury - Bass Guitar (1988 - 2014)\nPaul Newbury - Drums (1988 - 2005) Deceased\nJimmy Carroll - Guitars, Banjo, Mandolin, Tin Whistle, Uilleann pipes (1988 - 2003)\nBrad Drury - Drums (2005 - 2014)\nPaul Hallam - Mandolin (2010)\nDaniel Hughes - Electric Guitar ()\nRyan Holleywell - Electric Guitar ()\n'Mushy' - Drums (2014 - 2015)\nScott Walters - Drums (2015–2017)\nEllis Waring - Acoustic Guitar, Mandolin, Bouzouki, Banjo (2010–2017)\nJohn Leonard - Guitars, Banjo, Mandolin, Tin Whistle, Uilleann pipes (2017–2019)\nLeslie Carter - Electric Guitar (2015–2019)\nJohnny Edwards - Banjo, Acoustic Guitar, Mandolin, Accordion, Whistle, Harmonica, Mandola (2019 - 2021)\nRyan Brooks - Electric Guitar (2019 - 2022)\nJohn Alexander - Bass Guitar (2014-2022)\nAlex Smith - Drums (2017-2022)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nBBC artists Ferocious Dog page"

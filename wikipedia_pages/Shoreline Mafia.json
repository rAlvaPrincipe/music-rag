    "text": "Shoreline Mafia is an American hip hop group based in Los Angeles, that was originally active from 2016 until 2020. Their debut mixtape, ShorelineDoThatShit (2017) garnered local success, leading to a commercial re-issue by Atlantic Records in May 2018. In August of that year, they released the extended play (EP) Party Pack, and its sequel, Party Pack Vol. 2 in September 2019. Their debut studio album, Mafia Bidness (2020) peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200. In April of that year, one of the band's founding members, Fenix Flexin announced his departure, leading its remaining members to briefly disband.\nIn May 2024, members OhGeesy and Fenix Flexin reunited and released the song \"Heat Stick\" under the Shoreline Mafia name, marking their first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 and confirming the band's return as a duo.\n\n\n== History ==\nFor most of their career, Shoreline Mafia was originally composed of four members: vocalist OhGeesy (Alejandro Carranza), guitarist Rob Vicious (Robert Magee), bassist Fenix Flexin (Fenix Rypinski) and drummer Master Kato (Malik Carson). Ohgeesy and Fenix met in 2012 while doing graffiti in Los Angeles. The pair began making music soon after, and, sometime later, Rob Vicious and Master Kato joined them. Although they produced music for several years, they did not become a rap band until 2016. They chose the name Shoreline Mafia at some point after their formation.\nIn November 2017, they independently released their first full-length mixtape, ShoreLineDoThatShit. The album featured songs such as \"Nun Major,\" \"Musty,\" and \"Bottle Service\". Most of the songs on the album were produced by Ron-Ron including \"Musty\" and \"Bottle Service\", the beats for which the group was not initially authorized to use. Despite this, the two parties eventually formed a partnership that continues to exist. In December of that year, the group performed at the Rolling Loud Festival in San Bernardino, California. In the spring of 2018, the group headlined their \"Only The Xclusives\" (OTX) tour.\nIn May 2018, Atlantic Records announced that it had signed Shoreline Mafia. At that time, the label also re-released ShoreLineDoThatShit and debuted a new music video for the song \"Musty\". Later that month, the group embarked on the \"Still OTX\" tour, which included stops at the Rolling Loud Festival in Miami and, later, at the Billboard Hot 100 Music Festival in New York. In June 2018, Shoreline Mafia was featured on songs on the Ron-Ron and Friends compilation mixtape alongside 03 Greedo, Drakeo the Ruler, and others.\nThe following month, Rob Vicious released a solo mixtape titled Traplantic. The songs on the album also featured members of Shoreline Mafia, including \"Bands\" which had verses from everyone. In August 2018, the group released a 4-track EP called Party Pack via Atlantic Records. In the fall of 2018, the band went on their \"Only The Xclusives\" tour throughout the United States. The group also performed at the Los Angeles iteration of the Rolling Loud Festival in December 2018. In early April 2020, Fenix Flexin announced that he would be leaving Shoreline Mafia after the release of their new album, Mafia Bidness. The album followed on July 31, 2020.\nCurrently, members OhGeesy and Fenix Flexin reunited under the Shoreline Mafia band name as confirmed by both OhGeesy and Fenix Flexin in an our generation YouTube video, where they performed together at the Hollywood Palladium on October 6, 2023, and potentially hinted at releasing new music together soon. On May 10, 2024, OhGeesy announced the band’s return with a show in late September 2024 to celebrate the 5th anniversary of Party Pack Vol. 2, and they released the single \"Heat Stick\" under Shoreline Mafia on all platforms, confirming the return of the band as a duo.\nIn 19 June 2024, they performed the song \"Geekaleek\", for Kendrick Lamar's concert The Pop Out: Ken & Friends at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, during the first set by DJ Hed, titled the Act I – DJ Hed & Friends.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent Members\n\nOhGeesy – lead vocals, backing vocals(2016–2020, 2023-present)\nFenix Flexin – lead vocals, backing vocals (2016–2020, 2023-present)\nFormer members\n\nRob Vicious – lead vocals, backing vocals, production (2016-2020)\nMaster Kato – lead vocals, backing vocals (2016–2020)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

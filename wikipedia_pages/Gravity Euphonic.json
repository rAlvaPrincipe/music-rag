    "text": "Gravity Euphonic is an industrial metal/industrial rock band from Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n\n== History ==\nGravity Euphonic is Eric Hunter, Jamie French and Orion Quest. Eric Hunter started making music in 1995 with vocalist, Justin McKimmey.  In 2005, Gravity Euphonic was born and their project evolved into the industrial rock/industrial metal driven sound that can be heard today. The band's sound includes heavy orchestration, distorted synthesizers, electronic drums and electric guitar.\nIn 2006, several line-up changes took place as the band recorded the Secret EP.  McKimmey left the band and was replaced with vocalist/multi-instrumentalist, Jamie French.  Upon the EP's release, one reviewer described the album as a \"new and exciting revival of electronica or industrial pop music\", while another pointed out the questionably over-produced sound of the album, asking the question, \"should I be giggling or dancing?\"\nFollowing the short tour that accompanied Secret, McKimmey returned to the band as vocalist and Gravity Euphonic released their full-length album, Sunlight Kills in 2007.  The album, described as \"a solid collection of energetic dance mixes and hard driving industrial beats\" was followed up with a second tour of the east coast of the US.\nIn late 2008, the band announced that they had signed to the independent music label, Radio-Active-Music. Shortly afterwards in April, 2009, Gravity Euphonic announced Jamie French's return to the band through the first installment of their Future News from the Future News video series.  The band would continue to use the Future News videos to announce news for upcoming tour dates the upcoming self-titled record, Gravity Euphonic, which would be released in September of the same year.\nThe album, Gravity Euphonic was described by the band's label as \"laid-back angst-laden industrial rock\".  The reviewers disagreed however, and called the album \"solidly awesome without any pretence\" while another said that Gravity Euphonic \"lends an animalistic primevalness to what is usually a more refined and technological genre\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Lost - Volume 1 (2010)\nGravity Euphonic - (2009)\nSunlight Kills - (2007)\nSecret - (2006)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nLockout 2008 (Radio-Active-Music - 2008) \"Dance or Die â€“ Bardo in Motion Remix\" \"Tragedy\"\nIn Memoriam: Kairi Mais (Radio-Active-Music - 2009) \"Tragedy 2009\"\nRadio-Active-Music Label Sampler 2010 (Radio-Active-Music - 2010) \"Livid All Along\"\nGCS 1 (COMA Music Magazine - 2011) \"Brace Leg (Demo)\"\n\n\n== Music videos ==\nLivid All Along - (5/23/2010)\nBrace Leg -(6/24/2010)\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndustrial metal\nIndustrial rock\nElectronic music\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGravity Euphonic official website\nMyspace Artists: Gravity Euphonic official MySpace page"

    "text": "Shazna (stylized as SHAZNA) is a Japanese visual kei rock band originally active from 1993 to 2000. Originally having a strong gothic/post-punk influence, the band's sound greatly shifted to a more new wave direction by 1996. At their peak, they were considered one of \"the big four of visual kei\" alongside La'cryma Christi, Fanatic Crisis and Malice Mizer. Their 1998 major label debut album Gold Sun and Silver Moon reached the number two position on the Oricon chart, sold over a million copies and was named \"Rock Album of the Year\" at the Japan Gold Disc Awards. In 2006, Shazna reunited, though after releasing an album and a single they disbanded once again in 2009. In 2017, Shazna officially reunited again for their 20th anniversary.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed in 1993 with Izam on vocals, A・O・I on guitar, Niy on bass and Katsura on drums. Katsura left in 1996 and joined Baiser, leaving the trio. Perhaps the band's most notable feature was vocalist Izam and his choice of fashion; taking the cross-dressing feminine look to an extreme. Izam was largely influenced by Boy George and Culture Club, whom he later did a cover album of in 1998.\nWith the release of their major debut single \"Melty Love\" on August 27, 1997, Shazna gained immense popularity and many awards. It reached number two on the Oricon chart, earned them the \"Best Newcomer\" award from the Japan Cable Awards (Nihon Yusen Taisho) and helped their album Gold Sun and Silver Moon, which was named \"Rock Album of the Year\" by Japan Gold Disc Awards, be certified Million by the RIAJ. The album was named one of the top albums from 1989–1998 in a 2004 issue of the music magazine Band Yarouze.\nIn 1999, Izam married famous idol Hinano Yoshikawa, only to file for separation two months later and divorce two months after that. Both the marriage and divorce caused a scandal.\nIn October they released a cover of Ippu-Do's \"Violet September Love\" as a single. In 1999 Shazna signed to Toshiba EMI and released the album Pure Hearts in June. Their last single (and their second Christmas single) \"Winter's Review\" was released in December. In January 2000, a singles collection was released, however in October Shazna went on an activity pause.\nThe members all went in different musical directions. Izam, with a much less feminine look, became a solo singer and turned to acting, appearing in several films such as Chinese Dinner, G@me and Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: Act Zero, a special episode of the live-action series based on the popular Sailor Moon manga. Back in 1998 Izam also had a cameo appearance in the Crayon Shin-chan movie Crayon Shin-chan: Blitzkrieg! Pig's Hoof's Secret Mission, which used Shazna's song \"Pureness\" as its theme song. A・O・I performs as an acoustic guitarist and singer, and became a filmmaker. Niy performs with the band Fanble.\nIn June 2006, after 6 years Shazna announced that they were reuniting. They held their first concert on September 5, 2006 and released the single \"Heart\" on April 25. They released the album 10th Melty Life on August 8, 2007, 10 years after the release of their major single debut \"Melty Love\". On November 3, 2008, Shazna announced that they would disband and played their last concert on March 22, 2009 at Shibuya O-East.\nShazna's song \"Melty Love\" was covered by BugLug on the compilation Crush! -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-. The album was released on January 26, 2011 and features current visual kei bands covering songs from bands that were important to the '90s visual kei movement.\nIn August 2017, Shazna officially reunited for the 20th anniversary of their major label debut. In addition to Izam, A・O・I and Niy, their lineup includes three new female members; second vocalist Raychell, drummer Natsume and saxophonist Asuka.\n\n\n== Members ==\nIzam – vocals (1993–2000, 2006–2009, 2017–2019, 2023–present)\nA・O・I – guitar (1993–2000, 2017–2019, 2023–present)\nNiy – bass guitar (1993–2000, 2006–2009, 2017–2019, 2023–present)\nAsuka – saxophone (2017–2019, 2023–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nKatsura (桂‐KATSURA‐) – drums (1993–1996)\nRaychell – vocals (2017–2019)\nNatsume – drums (2017–2019)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSophia (November 30, 1994)\nMelty Case (March 14, 1996)\nRaspberry Time (August 1, 1996), Oricon Albums Chart Peak Position: No. 43\nPromise Eve (January 22, 1997) No. 16\nGold Sun and Silver Moon (January 22, 1998) No. 2\nPure Hearts (June 30, 1999) No. 15\n10th Melty Life (August 8, 2007)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nBest Album 1993–2000: Oldies (January 1, 2000) No. 24\nSingle Best Shazna & Izam (September 5, 2007, singles collection & Izam's solo)\nSHAZNA LOVE SELECTION - EP (December 12, 2014, ballads collection) \n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Stillness for Dear\" (April 17, 1994, limited to 330 copies)\n\"Dizziness\" (December 8, 1995, limited to 500 copies)\n\"Dizziness\" (January 5, 1996, re-release with a B-side track, limited to 1000 copies)\n\"Melty Love\" (August 27, 1997), Oricon Singles Chart Peak Position: No. 2\nEnding theme of 所さんのこれアリなんじゃないの!?\n\"Violet September Love\" (すみれ September Love, October 8, 1997) No. 2\nEnding theme of Beat Takeshi's TV Tackle (ビートたけしのTVタックル)\n\"White Silent Night\" (December 3, 1997) No. 1\nEnding theme of King's Brunch (王様のブランチ)\n\"Sweet Heart Memory\" (January 7, 1998) No. 2\nEnding theme of Tonight 2 (トゥナイト2)\n\"Pureness\" (April 22, 1998) No. 4\nTheme song of Crayon Shin-chan: Blitzkrieg!

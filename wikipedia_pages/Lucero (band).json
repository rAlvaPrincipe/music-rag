Lucero's sound has been described as a \"synthesis of soul, rock, and country [that] is distinctly Memphisian.\" They have released 11 albums and one live DVD, mostly through their own label. The band mainly tours around North America.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== 1998–2007: Formation and early years ===\nLucero had their start in Memphis, Tennessee, and played for the first time in early 1998.

The cover, which includes a line taken for the album title, featured backing vocals from Big Star drummer, Jody Stephens.

Like their previous album, Among the Ghosts, When You Found Me was produced by Matt Ross-Spang, recorded at Sam Phillip's Recording and released on their own label, Liberty & Lament. Rolling Stone states that he album \"continues the darker trend started by Among the Ghosts and feels more intimate than raucous, horn-driven Lucero records like Women & Work and 1372 Overton Park\" and that it \"updates Lucero’s sound in interesting ways with the addition of synthesizers\".\n\n\n=== 2023: Should've Learned By Now ===\nLucero releaseed their 12th album, Should've Learned By Now on 24th, February 2023. As in their previous two, this album was produced by Matt Ross-Sprang. It is noted for having more upbeat, fun songs that did not suit the darker tone of the previous two.\nPitchfork gave the album a score of 7.5, saying that \"what really distinguishes Should’ve Learned by Now from their previous barroom musings is the humor in these songs\", while also highlighting drummer, Roy Berry, stating that he's \"still one of the most inventive drummers around\". Paste Magazine gave it a score of 7.1, saying that the album is \"a marriage between the band's surging early angst and latter-day introspection.\"\n\n\n== Collaborations and other projects ==\nThe first solo release from frontman Ben Nichols, The Last Pale Light in the West, was released in January 2009 on Lucero's label Liberty & Lament.

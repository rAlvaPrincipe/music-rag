    "text": "Tha Bizness is an American record production and songwriting duo from Seattle, Washington, composed of Justin \"Henny\" Henderson and Christopher John \"Dow Jones\" Whitacre. Tha Bizness have produced songs for several prominent artists, including Chris Brown, Ne-Yo, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Nas, 8Ball & MJG, Ice Cube, 50 Cent, and Kendrick Lamar, among others. In 2009, they received a Producer of the Year nomination at the BET Hip Hop Awards.\n\n\n== History ==\nHenny, who was previously a singer under the name \"J Henn,\" and Dow Jones, who was previously a mixtape DJ, joined forces to form the production team \"Tha Bizness.\" Dow used his mixtape series, titled \"Play Your Position,\" to promote their beats. Eventually, they were noticed by West Coast artists, for whom they produced songs for mixtapes. In 2007, Sha Money XL contacted the duo via Myspace and offered the duo a production deal with G-Unit Records and Sha Money's management team, Teamwork Music.\nTha Bizness achieved mainstream success with the production of \"Every Girl\" from Young Money's 2009 album \"We Are Young Money.\" The instrumental was originally intended to be for R. Kelly, for whom Tha Bizness had previously collaborated on \"Hair Braider\" in early 2008, but Lil Wayne heard the beat and bought it first. Tha Bizness also produced another song on the same album, titled \"Ms. Parker.\"\n\n\n== Production discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles produced ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nTha Bizness at AllMusic\nTha Bizness discography at Discogs\nTha Bizness discography at MusicBrainz\nTha Bizness on SoundCloud"

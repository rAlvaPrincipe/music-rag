    "text": "Sigma are an English drum and bass DJ and record production duo consisting of Cameron James Edwards and Joseph Aluin Lenzie. They met at Leeds University at drum and bass nights. Their 2010 collaboration with DJ Fresh, \"Lassitude\", peaked at number 98 on the UK Singles Chart. Their single \"Nobody to Love\" topped the UK Singles Chart, becoming their first UK number one. Their second was the follow-up single \"Changing\", featuring Paloma Faith.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2006–2009: Formation and career beginnings ===\nLenzie and Edwards met in 2006 at Leeds University; Edwards was working in local record store Tribe Records and with Echo Location's Obi running local night Event Horizon, while Lenzie was DJing hip-hop and warming up Event Horizon for acts. Once they had finished in Leeds, they relocated to London and became a three-piece with Ben Mauerhoff, being signed under DJ Fresh's Breakbeat Kaos. After a while, Mauerhoff left. In December 2008, they formed their own record label, Life Recordings (so called because, according to Lenzie, the industry demanded that it be their life). Its inaugural release was a VIP mix of their early Bingo Beats single \"El Presidente\".\n\n\n=== 2009–2012: Stand Tall and Night & Day EPs ===\nSigma have produced music through Hospital Records. In June 2009, they made the song \"Paint It Black\" for the compilation album Sick Music. Later that year, they released their second Life Recordings release \"Nexus\" / \"Front to Back\". In 2010, the duo released their two-part Stand Tall EP on the drum and bass label, Breakbeat Kaos. In December 2010, Sigma and DJ Fresh released the single \"Lassitude\" featuring Koko as the fifth single from DJ Fresh's album Kryptonite. The song became one of their first charting singles as it peaked at number 98 on the UK Singles Chart and number 11 on the UK Dance Chart. After the release of their late-2011 Night & Day EPs on their label, in 2012, Sigma toured the UK, Europe, Australasia and the United States. They were the supporting act for DJ Fresh on his first live UK tour. The tour included dates supporting fellow former Leeds student Christopher Mercer (also known as Rusko).\n\n\n=== 2013–2015: Breakthrough and Life ===\nThe duo signed to 3 Beat Records in the summer of 2013. They had also remixed tracks for Ellie Goulding, Eric Prydz, Skepta and Sway. Following their remix of the Stylo G single \"Soundbwoy\", they released their debut single with 3Beat, \"Summer Calling\", featuring Taylor Fowlis. Their second single with 3Beat, \"Rudeboy\", featuring Doctor, was released in December 2013. The song peaked at number 56 on the UK Singles Chart and number 12 on the UK Dance Chart. They released their third single with 3Beat, \"Nobody to Love\" (a rework of Kanye West's \"Bound 2\"), on 6 April 2014. It topped the UK Singles Chart upon release. To celebrate, they released a new song, \"Divine\", for free download on 16 April 2014. In July 2014, Sigma announced their single \"Changing\" co-written by Ella Eyre and featuring vocals from Paloma Faith; it was released on 14 September 2014 and became their second consecutive number one song on the UK Singles Chart.

In 2016, Sigma announced their biggest headline tour including a date at the O2 Academy Brixton, London. Sigma were announced as one of the headline acts at the pro-Brexit music event Bpoplive, but pulled out on learning that it was a political event. Sigma stated that they in no way supported the beliefs of the organisers and promptly pulled out on learning this information.\n\n\n=== 2016–present: Hope ===\nOn 11 March 2016, Sigma released their first single of their upcoming second studio album entitled \"Nightingale\".

After the war in 1864, the Second Schleswig War, they played for several years for Kronborg Castle, which had become a military installation. After the reunification, they were garrisoned in Sønderborg. Finally, in 1953, they settled down in Haderslev.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSlesvigske musikkorps website (Danish)"

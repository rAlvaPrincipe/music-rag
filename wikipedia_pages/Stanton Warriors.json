    "text": "Stanton Warriors are a British DJ and production duo consisting of Dominic Butler and Mark Yardley. Originally from the West Country, the duo have performed internationally with their infamous Stanton Sessions parties in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. Their name was taken from a manhole cover, made by Stanton Ironworks.  Stanton record player needles are popular with DJs for their ability to scratch records.\nThe Stanton Warriors' third mix album was released in the UK on 27 October 2008, entitled Stanton Session Vol. 3, which is their best-seller to date, and received 5 out of 5 from iDJ. This was also released in a limited run, deluxe edition manhole cover tin pack.\nThe graffiti style artwork (and their SW logo) seen on many of their releases and merchandise is the work of several renowned graffiti artists, SheOne and Rough, the latter of which won a design award for the artwork on the Stanton Warrior's single, \"Da Antidote\".\nThe Stantons have been known to release free to download promotional DJ sets through their websites, where there is also live video footage of their gigs. Now based in West London, they run a successful record label (Punks) out of their recording studio.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums and EPs ===\n1997: Headz of State EP (with Deeper Cut)\n1997: Deeper Cut/Headz of State EP\n2001: The Stanton Session\n2006: The Stanton Sessions Vol. 2 / The Lost Files\n2006: Fabric Live 30\n2007: Remixes (Skint) – (compilation album of Stanton Warrior's remixes of other artists)\n2008: The Stanton Sessions Vol. 3\n2011: The Warriors – UK No. 186\n2013: Sessions IV\n2014: The Bones EP\n2015: Rebel Bass\n2015: Keep It Movin' EP\n2016: Sound of Punks\n2019: Rise\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2000: \"Da Virus\" – UK No. 91 (2004)\n2001: \"Da Antidote\" – UK No. 69\n2003: \"Break Me with You / Reckless Dub\" – UK No. 124\n2003: \"Everybody Come On (Can U Feel It)\" (Stanton Warriors Remix) – Mr Reds vs DJ Skribble – UK No. 13\n2004: \"Slanty\" – UK No. 93\n2004: \"Adventures in Success\" – UK No. 93\n2006: \"Get 'Em High\" (feat.

The video was directed by Edward John Drake.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStanton Warriors website"

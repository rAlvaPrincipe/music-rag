    "text": "MIGGS is an American pop/rock band formed in 2001 in San Francisco, California, United States, by Don Miggs (vocals/guitar). Michael Lombardo (bass/vocals) joined in 2005, Walker Adams (drums/vocals) joined in 2011 and John Luzzi (guitar/vocals) joined in 2012.  Over the course of a decade, the band has released five albums and toured extensively with Maroon 5, Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver's Scott Weiland, LIVE's Ed Kowalczyk, Plain White T's, Green River Ordinance, Parachute, Candlebox, and KT Tunstall.\n\n\n== History ==\nDon Miggs teamed up with drummer Jason Gianni and bass guitarist Mark Baker in San Francisco, California in 2001. After playing with many guitarists, the band independently released the album Anyway in 2003 which was recorded for less than $2,000 over the course of 50 hours. Michael Muller, who works and performs on the Late Show with David Letterman, played all lead guitar parts on the album. The band sold over 10,000 copies of Anyway and spent the next three years playing throughout California. At this time, MIGGS started to develop a fan base playing at local Borders and Barnes & Noble bookstores two to four times a week.\nGavin MacKillop (Goo Goo Dolls, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Sugarcult) teamed up with Miggs to produce Insomnia in 2005. The band embarked on their first national tour, opening for Cake (band), Aerosmith, Kid Rock and Lifehouse.\nAfter a brief hiatus, Don Miggs released the solo acoustic EP, \"Late Nights And Early Mornings\".\n2006 saw a reformed MIGGS with Don Miggs' childhood friend and original bassist Michael Lombardo joining the band. In 2008, the band released Unraveled, a collection of unreleased and alternate versions of songs from Miggs' previous three albums.  They achieved chart success with the singles \"Perfect\" produced and mixed by JC Convertino, \"I Believe,\" which reached No. 66 and No. 82 on Billboard's Hot AC chart. \"I Believe\" landed No. 7 on the Hot AC Media Base Chart and the band played on the national morning show Good Morning America.\n2010 saw the release of MIGGS first album of new music in five years with Wide Awake. Wide Awake was produced by Ken Lewis and included the single \"Girls & Boys,\" which hit the Billboard's Adult Album Alternative Chart at No. 42 and No. 89 on the Billboard's Hot AC chart. The music video for \"Girls and Boys\" was directed by Justin Purser. The next single off \"Wide Awake\" was \"Let The Games Begin\", which was also directed by Justin Purser and starred Lindsay Lohan. In the video, Lohan plays herself, partaking in celebrity activities by day and posing as an anonymous graffiti artist who paints the city walls of Los Angeles at night. The video landed the band major media attention from MTV Networks, Access Hollywood and many others.\nIn late 2011, MIGGS worked with the record producer Phil Ramone to record their fifth album, 15th & Hope.  The album was released on September 11, 2012 on Elm City Music/EMI and entered the Billboard 200 at 163 and Heatseekers chart at number 7.\nIn June 2015, MIGGS released a rock single \"Ordinary\" that garnered attention of radio stations across the country with plays on Sirius XM station Octane and iHeart Radio's SIXX Pick, as well as hitting number 40 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart. The long awaited self-titles album, Miggs, was released in 2020. \nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic the original members of the band worked on new music during quarantine. The result was the early 2021 released single \" Harder Than It Has To Be\".\nThe band is currently on hiatus as all members work on other projects and ventures.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nDon Miggs - Vocals/Guitar - 2001–present\nJohn Luzzi - Guitar/Vocals - 2012–present\nMichael Lombardo - Bass/Vocals - 2006–present\nWalker Adams - Drums/Vocals - 2011–present\n\n\n== Previous members ==\nMichael Muller - guitar (2001–2002)\nMicah Beverly - guitar (2002–2004)\nJohn Carta - guitar (2004–2005)\nSep Velizadeh - guitar (2006)\nMonroe Grisman - guitar (2007)\nJason Gianni - drums (2001–2006)\nBrian Totten - drums (2007–2009)\nRyan Scarborough - drums (2009–2010)\nMark Baker - bass (2001–2005)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMIGGS Interview Aug 2011 - Access Hollywood\nMIGGS on Myspace\nMIGGS on YouTube\nMIGGS Archived 2011-10-08 at the Wayback Machine on Perez Hilton"

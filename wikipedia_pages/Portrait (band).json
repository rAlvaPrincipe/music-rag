    "text": "Portrait is an American R&B and hip hop vocal quartet, consisting of members Michael Angelo Saulsberry, Irving Washington III, Eric Kirkland and Philip Johnson. The quartet group's music sound was influenced by the new jack swing style of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe group, which hailed from Los Angeles, California debuted in 1992 with a self-titled album riding on the end of the new jack swing era. Their debut single \"Here We Go Again!\", which sampled Michael Jackson's Off the Wall track \"I Can't Help It\", reached #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #3 on the R&B chart in early 1993, and the second single \"Honey Dip\" also reached the R&B top 20.\nThe group was featured in an episode of Family Matters, titled \"Stormy Weather\", performing \"Here We Go Again!\". In that episode, they were performing at a high school prom, where Waldo mentions that he got them to do it because one of the members happens to be his cousinâ€”Waldo adds that his cousin says he'll do whatever Waldo asks him to do as long as he doesn't tell people that they're related. Although Steve Urkel ends up correctly guessing which of the members is Waldo's cousin.\nThroughout 1993 and 1994, Portrait could be heard lending their voices to various projects, appearing on the soundtracks to the movies, Addams Family Values and Blankman, as well as singing on the Black Men United song, \"U Will Know\" for the Jason's Lyric Soundtrack.  Portrait also provided backing vocals on the Quincy Jones single \"Slow Jams\", which featured Babyface and Tamia on lead vocals, in 1995.  The song reached #68 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nAlso in 1995, the group released their second album, All That Matters.  The album had a few minor hits, with \"I Can Call You\" reaching #22 on the R&B charts and \"How Deep Is Your Love\", a cover of the Bee Gees song, briefly appearing on the Hot 100.\nIn 2018, the group returned as a trio consisting of Michael Angelo Saulsberry, Phillip Johnson, and new member Ruben \"R.C.\" Monge (former lead singer of R&B band Po' Broke 'N Lonely?) with a new single entitled \"In The Moment\" off of their forthcoming project entitled \"Beach Music\" which landed them opportunities to tour in Germany and the United Kingdom respectively.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Featured singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPortrait Bio\nBillboard"

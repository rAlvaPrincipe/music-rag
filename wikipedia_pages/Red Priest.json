    "text": "Red Priest is a British Baroque instrumental group that was formed in 1997 by Piers Adams. Currently it is composed of four performers: Adams on recorder, Adam Summerhayes on violin, Angela East on cello and David Wright on harpsichord. The group is named after the red-haired Italian priest and Baroque composer, Antonio Vivaldi.\nThe quartet plays in a flamboyant, theatrical and virtuosic style making use of props, costumes, dramatic lighting and other effects. The pieces they perform are generally their own arrangements, though based very closely on the original music by Vivaldi, Bach, et al.\nIn addition to touring all over the world, Red Priest are a frequent guest on BBC Radio 3's In Tune programme. They have released several albums, including a contemporary take on Vivaldi's The Four Seasons.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nPriest On The Run - 1998\nNightmare In Venice - 2002\nThe 4 Seasons - 2003\nPirates Of The Baroque - 2008\nJohann, I'm Only Dancing - 2009\nHandel In The Wind - 2014\nThe Baroque Bohemians - 2017\n\n\n== Previous members ==\nJulia Bishop â€“ violinist\nHoward Beach - harpsichordist\nJulian Rhodes - harpsichordist\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1]\nRed priest on Facebook"

    "text": "My Secret Passion: The Arias is the first classical album by Michael Bolton featuring the Philharmonia Orchestra under the direction of Steven Mercurio. The album includes a duet with Renée Fleming.\nDue to both a lack of substantial promotion and criticism that Bolton lacked the range to perform opera, the album peaked on the Billboard Top 200 at No. 112, marking the end of a period of chart success for Bolton.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Pourquoi me réveiller?\" from Werther by Jules Massenet - 2:57\n\"Nessun dorma\" from Turandot by Giacomo Puccini - 3:14\n\"Una furtiva lagrima\" from L'elisir d'amore by Gaetano Donizetti - 4:52\n\"M'apparì\" from Martha by Friedrich von Flotow - 3:08\n\"Che gelida manina\" from La bohème by Giacomo Puccini - 4:49\n\"O soave fanciulla\" from La bohème by Giacomo Puccini (Duet with Renée Fleming) - 4:26\n\"Vesti la giubba\" from Pagliacci by Ruggero Leoncavallo - 3:14\n\"E lucevan le stelle\" from Tosca by Giacomo Puccini - 3:17\n\"Recondita armonia\" from Tosca by Giacomo Puccini - 2:24\n\"È la solita storia\" from L'arlesiana by Francesco Cilea - 4:42\n\"Celeste Aïda\" from Aïda by Giuseppe Verdi - 3:38\n\n\n== Credits ==\nProducers – Grace Row and Michael Bolton\nVocals produced by Michael Bolton and Dave Reitzas.\nRecorded by Rob Rapley at Abbey Road Studios (London, England), Passion Studios (Westport, CT), Record Plant (Los Angeles, CA) and Sony Music Studios (New York, NY).\nMixed by Dave Reitzas at The Hit Factory (New York, NY).\nMastered by Vlado Meller at Sony Music Studios.\nDesign – Joel Zimmerman\nIllustration – Tom Woodruff\nPhotography – Sheila Metzner\n\n\n== References =="

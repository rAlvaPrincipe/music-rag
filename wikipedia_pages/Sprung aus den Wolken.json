    "text": "Sprung aus den Wolken is a German band based out of Berlin, part of Berlin's underground music movement of the 1980s â€“ sometimes referred to as the \"Geniale Dilletanten\" movement. Their music is typically minimalistic industrial music.\nThe band's name is German for \"Jump from the Clouds\". The origin of this title is unknown, however it should be known that the phrase was the title of a 1963 board game, although the possibility that it is a German idiom or simply just made up should not be ruled out either. Also, \"Sprung aus den Wolken\" was the title of the German broadcasts of Ripcord in the 1960s.\n\n\n== Members ==\nFred Alpi\nKiddy Citny\nPeter Prima\nContributing artists:\n\nAlexander Hacke\nN.U.

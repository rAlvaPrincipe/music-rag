    "text": "Beborn Beton is a German synthpop band founded in 1989, with their first album release in 1993. Their debut named Tybalt is a compilation of the best tracks written in the first three years of their band history and was very well received in the electronic music scene. In 1995 the follow-up album Concrete Ground was released. After a change of record label in 1996 their break-through album Nightfall was published featuring the club-filler \"Im Innern Einer Frau\".\nThe album Rückkehr zum Eisplaneten was released in 2000. It features remixes of Beborn Beton songs by artists such as Covenant, Camouflage, Neuroticfish and Daniel Myer of Haujobb, as well as remixes by Beborn Beton.\nThe word Beborn has no particular meaning, while Beton is the German word for concrete, which according to the band refers to the urban environment they grew up in.\n\n\n== Members ==\nStefan \"Till\" Tillmann, composing, synthesizers, drums\nMichael B Wagner, composing, synthesizers\nStefan Netschio, lyrics, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\nTybalt 1993                       (Label: Subtronic)\nTwisted 1993                      (Label: Subtronic)\nConcrete Ground 1994              (Label: Subtronic)\nNightfall 1996                    (Label: Strange Ways)\nTybalt 1997 - Re-Release          (Label: Dark Star)\nTruth 1997                        (Label: Strange Ways)\nAnother World 1997                (Label: Strange Ways)\nConcrete Ground 1998 - Re-Release (Label: Strange Ways)\nPoison 1999                       (Label: Strange Ways)\nFake 1999                         (Label: Strange Ways)\nFake Bonus 1999                   (Label: Strange Ways)\nRückkehr zum Eisplaneten 2000     (Label: Strange Ways)\nTales from another world 2002     (Label: Wtii, LLC)\nA Worthy Compensation 2015        (Label: Dependent)\nShe Cried EP 2016        (Label: Dependent)\nDarkness Falls Again 2023         (Label: Dependent)\n\n\n== Remixes for other artists done by Beborn Beton ==\nApoptygma Berzerk – Kathy’s Song\nInfam – Limbo\nClaire Voyant – Majesty\nFunker Vogt – Under Deck\nCleen – The Voice\nDe/Vision – Your Hands on My Skin\nClan of Xymox – Something Wrong\nCamouflage – I Can’t Feel You\nIn Strict Confidence – Seven Lives\nWolfsheim – Approaching Lightspeed\nVirtual Server – The Earth (featuring Reagan Jones of Iris)\nTechnoir – Manifesto\nTechnoir – All in My Head\nPurwien – Alle Fehler (featuring Joachim Witt)\nHelalyn Flowers – DGTal Blood\nPurwien – So kalt\nJames D.

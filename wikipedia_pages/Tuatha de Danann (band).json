    "text": "Tuatha de Danann is a Brazilian Celtic metal band formed in 1995 in Varginha, Minas Gerais; it is known for their merry Celtic dance rhythms, flute melodies, Celtic mythology-inspired lyrics and the original jesting tones such as gnome-choirs, etc. The band is named after the race of supernaturally-gifted people in Irish mythology, the Tuatha Dé Danann, roughly translated to \"People of Dana\".\nBetween July and August 2005, Tuatha de Danann did their first tour outside Brazil; they performed in France and Germany. In France, the band played shows in Saint Brieuc, Languidic, Brest, Hennebont, Tours, Grenoble, and Rheims, while in Germany the band played at the Wacken Open Air festival.\nFollowing a hiatus, the band returned in 2013 at the Roça 'n' Roll festival organized by frontman Bruno Maia; during the occasion they performed with Martin Walkyier (ex-Sabbat, ex-Skyclad).\nIn 2015, they released their first album since 2004's Trova di Danú: Dawn of the New Sun. In the period between both efforts, two groups spun off Tuatha de Danann: Kemunna and Tray of Gift. Maia also released a solo album, Braia.\nIn 2019, they released In Nomine Élreann, containing 11 songs, nine of which are traditional Irish songs. One of the original songs, \"King\", was perceived as criticizing Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro. In 2023 they released The Nameless Cry.\nOn 13 November 2024, the band announced through their social media that keyboardist Edgard Brito had died at the age of 50.\n\n\n== Line-up ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nBruno Maia – lead vocals, guitars, flute, whistle, mandolin, bodhrán (1994–2010, 2013–present)\nGiovani Gomes – bass, harsh vocals (1999–2010, 2013–present)\nRafael Wagner - guitar (2023–present)\nRafael Delfino - drums (2023–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nRogério Vilela – bass (1995–1999)\nWilson Melkor – drums (1995–2000)\nFelipe Batiston – keyboards (1995–2000)\nMarcos Ulisses – vocals (1998–1999)\nLeonardo Godtfriedt – keyboards, violin (2000–2002)\nRafael Castro – keyboards, piano (2002–2003)\nRodrigo Berne – lead guitar (1994–2010, 2013–2017)\nAlex Navar – uilleann pipes (2013–2018)\nRodrigo Abreu – drums, percussion (2000–2010, 2013–2018)\nEdgard Brito – keyboards (2003–2010, 2013–2024; his death)\n\n\n=== Touring/session members ===\nRafael Wagner – guitar\nAlex Navar – bagpipe\nNathan Viana – violin\nRafael Delfino – drums\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nTuatha de Danann (1999)\nTingaralatingadun (2001)\nThe Delirium Has Just Began...

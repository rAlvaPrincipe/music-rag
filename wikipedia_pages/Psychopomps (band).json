    "text": "Psychopomps is an electro-industrial band from Denmark formed by Jesper Schmidt and Flemming Norre Larsen. They were signed to Zoth Ommog Records in the early 1990s followed by Cleopatra Records. Their early records were recorded at Strip Studios by their close friend and label mate, Claus Larsen of Leaether Strip. The only notable line-up change was the addition of Kaare Mogensen for the recording of Fiction Non-Fiction. The band appeared defunct after the release of Fiction Non-Fiction, but has created a Myspace page with new content as well as old and unreleased songs.\nIn 2014, Infacted Recordings released a retrospective compilation of the band's work titled Infection Start 90.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n(All years are the original EU releases)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1991 – Assassins DK United\n1993 – Pro-Death Ravers\n1995 – Six Six Six Nights in Hell\n1997 – Fiction Non-Fiction\n\n\n=== EP ===\n1990 – More DK – (12\"/EPCD)\n1993 – In The Skin\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1992 – \"'Godsh*t\" (containing explicit content in lyrics as mild-course language) – (12\"/MCD)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n1996 – First Blood\n2000 – The Best Of\n2014 - Infection Start 90\n\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n2004 – Saw – (song \"Wonderful World\")\n\n\n== References =="

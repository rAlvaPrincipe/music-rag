    "text": "Still Flyin' is an American Indie pop band based in San Francisco, founded in 2004 by Sean Rawls.\n\n\n== Name of the Band ==\nThe band is based on the song \"Never Gonna Touch the Ground\", a song that Rawls wrote and performed in a prior band, Je Suis France. After moving to San Francisco, Rawls recorded the song, which took on a life of its own resulting in the creation of Still Flyin'. The chorus of the song, \"Still Flyin', never gonna touch the ground\" was the source of the band's name as well as its debut album and title track.\n\n\n== Formation and History ==\nIn 2004, Sean Rawls, a veteran of bands Masters of the Hemisphere and Je Suis France moved from Athens, GA to San Francisco, CA. Upon arriving in San Francisco Rawls asked just about everybody he knew  to join his new project. Most of the friends he had in San Francisco were fellow musicians he had met through his prior bands, and many of them joined Rawls to form Still Flyin'.\nThe band played its first live show at the Hemlock Tavern in San Francisco in November, 2004. Shortly thereafter they embarked on a tour of the US West Coast opening for Architecture in Helsinki. In August, 2006 they went on their first tour of Scandinavia, playing at the Emmaboda Festival   in Sweden. During this tour they were joined onstage by Jens Lekman. Still Flyin' returned to Scandinavia in 2007. In 2008 they performed in Australia's St Jerome's Laneway Festival, where they met Spiral Stairs. He curated   the 2008 Sled Island Festival  in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and invited Still Flyin'. In early 2009 Still Flyin' toured Europe and returned to Australia to play St. Jerome's Laneway Festival once again. They played at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival  in Austin, Texas in early spring and summer saw them touring Europe once again, where they performed at the Secret Garden Party festival  in the UK.\nStill Flyin' signed with Antenna Farm in 2006 and released 2 EP's. In 2008, the band signed with Ernest Jenning (US), London-based Moshi Moshi and Australian label Lost and Lonesome for the release of their first full-length record.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nStill Flyin's sound is generally classified as reggae or rocksteady. However, the band has coined its own term to classify its sound and outlook: hammjamm, which is loosely defined as \"when a good time gets better\"  and with lifestyle ramifications involving \"friends, beers, high fives, parties and enjoying life to the fullest\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nAlthough the band started and is based in San Francisco, its members now stretch to all corners of the world. The band is made up of a \"core\" lineup with a long roster of \"spiritual members\", who join the band for live performances when geography permits.\nCurrent Core Lineup:\nSean Rawls – vocals, guitar (Masters of the Hemisphere, Je Suis France)\nZach Moran – guitar\nPhil Horan – drums (Maserati)\nMaria Niubo – keys, vocals\nSamuele Palazzi – bass (The Calorifer Is Very Hot, The Ian Fays)\nMembers on Past Recordings:\nYoshi Nakamoto – drums (The Aislers Set, Scenic Vermont, Poastal, Eux Autres)\nGabe Saucedo – vibraphone, saxophone, guitar, vocals (Red Pony Clock)\nBren Mead – percussion, guitar, bass, drums, vocals (Masters of the Hemisphere, Veteran, Summer Hymns)\nMark Monnone – bass (The Lucksmiths)\nMindy Schweitzer-Rawls – vocals\nMarjan Esfandiari – vocals\nJaime Knight – vocals (Poundsign, Dear Nora)\nGary Olson – trumpet, vocals (The Ladybug Transistor)\nFrank Jordan – saxophone (Bright Lights)\nIsobel Knowles – trumpet, keys, vocals (Architecture in Helsinki, The Icypoles)\nAlicia Vanden Heuvel – keys, vocals (The Aislers Set, Poundsign)\nDrew Cramer – bass (Personal and the Pizzas, the Mantles)\nLizeth Santos – vocals\nBecky Barron – vocals (Poundsign, Kids On A Crime Spree, Bright Lights)\nBrian Girgus – bongos (lowercase, Track Star)\nAdrian Finch – keys, percussion, saxophone, vocals (Masters of the Hemisphere, Night Moves Gold, Dances With Wolves, Elf Power, Summer Hymns)\nPast Live Performers:\nWyatt Cusick – bass, guitar (Track Star, The Aislers Set)\nCarrie Jedlicka – keys, vocals\nIce Bergeron – reverb tank (Je Suis France, Peace Goat)\nOJ Hammond – guru (Je Suis France, Excalibrah)\nAke Stromer – saxophone (Love Is All, James Ausfahrt)\nTara Shackell – trombone, vocals (Architecture in Helsinki, The Icypoles)\nGus Franklin – percussion (Architecture in Helsinki, Sheahan Drive, The Smallgoods)\nAnna Storakers – vocals\nBrody Railton – reverb tank\nJosephine Olausson – vocals (Love Is All, Girlfrendo)\nRichard Baluyut – guitar (Versus)\nMarkus Gorsch – bongos (Love Is All, Girlfrendo, Glenn und Glenn)\nJens Lekman – guitar, vocals (Jens Lekman)\n\n\n== Influences ==\nRawls's songwriting is influenced by a lot of popular music.

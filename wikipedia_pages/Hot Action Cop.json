    "text": "Hot Action Cop is an American rock band from Nashville, Tennessee. They are known for their hit single \"Fever for the Flava\". Long Island, New York-native Rob Werthner formed the band in 2001 with bassist Luis Espaillat, drummer Kory Knipp, and guitarist Tim Flaherty, and added keyboardist Daniel Feese in 2002 prior to the tour to support their self-titled debut album. Knipp left in December 2003 but remained friends with the band, subbing in on drums when needed, and rejoined in 2011. Espaillat left in 2006 to pursue other musical ventures. Bass guitarist Juan Chavolla joined in 2008, and after playing for several years without a keyboardist, multi-instrumentalist Brian Smith, a long-time friend of Werthner's, joined in 2012.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Nutbag EP and Hot Action Cop (2001–2003) ===\nThe band's name came from the nickname that Werthner and his friends gave his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend in the 1990s. He was an NYPD officer with a 1970s parted and feathered hairstyle. When they saw him they'd say, \"here comes the hot action cop.\" Werthner cites musical influences including Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, The Eagles, New York hardcore, Southern hip-hop, punk, metal, reggae, and songwriters like Billy Joel and Elvis Costello.\nTheir first release, the EP Nutbag, was recorded in 2001 and released in 2002, and was only available to purchase at live shows or direct order from the band. The band released their debut album, the self-titled Hot Action Cop (produced by Michael Baker), on Lava Records/Atlantic Records in 2003. They achieved moderate success with the single \"Fever for the Flava\" despite limited radio support. The band toured extensively from October 2002 to December 2003 throughout the US, Canada, Germany, and England supporting bands such as Evanescence and Trapt, and including a spot on the northwestern leg of the 2003 Lollapalooza tour.\n\n\n=== 2009 EP ===\nHot Action Cop released a six-song EP in 2009 with Werthner, Flaherty, Espaillat, Feese, and Nashville session drummer Miles McPherson.\n\n\n=== Comfortably Numb (2012) ===\nOn May 1, 2012, the band released a cover of the Pink Floyd song \"Comfortably Numb\" on iTunes and Amazon. Recorded during a break from touring in 2003, the song features the original line-up of Werthner, Flaherty, Espaillat, Knipp, and Feese.\n\n\n=== Listen Up! (2014) ===\nThe band's fourth release Listen Up! was released on February 7, 2014, available on hotactioncop.com, Spotify, and iTunes. A video was produced for the song \"House of Pain\". It was subsequently used in promos for House of DVF on the E! Network. The album was dedicated to Daniel Feese, who died in January 2014.\n\n\n=== 2015–present ===\n\nEvery year since 2015, Hot Action Cop has headlined or co-headlined a private festival called Lampapalooza in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, and has shared the stage with Sponge, Public Enemy, Run-DMC, EPMD, Rakim, Sir Mix-a-Lot, Bobby Bare Jr., and Elephant Room.\nTimmy Flaherty has released two solo albums available on Spotify and iTunes, and is currently working on a third. He also plays in a Ramones tribute band with Daniel Feese's brother Dylan Feese on lead vocals.\nJuan Chavolla joined the Louisville, Kentucky band Elephant Room, playing live and recording with Malcolm Springer in Nashville, Tennessee. Elephant Room and Hot Action Cop have played several shows together with Chavolla pulling double duty on bass guitar.\nRob Werthner and original producer Michael Baker have been working together on a new Hot Action Cop release for the last few years.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nRob Werthner – vocals, rhythm and lead guitars (2001–present)\nTimmy Flaherty – lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals (2001–present)\nKory Knipp – drums (2001–2003, 2007, 2011–present)\nJuan Chavolla – bass guitar (2008–present)\nBrian Smith - keyboards, rhythm guitar, vocals, saxophone (2012–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nLuis Espaillat – bass guitar (2001–2006)\nDaniel Feese – keyboards (2002–2007, died 2014)\nMiles McPherson – drums (2004–2006)\nGary Horrie – drums (2007-2008)\nJohnannes Greer – drums (2008–2011)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nNutbag EP (2002)\nHot Action Cop (2003) – No. 46 US Heatseekers\n2009 EP (2009)\nListen Up!

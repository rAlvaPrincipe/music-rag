Rory McCartney of BMA Magazine says that the release \"is as much a deep conversation between dear friends as a collection of songs. Whimsical tales explore the poetry that exists below the surface of everyday life, if only you bother to look\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRuby for Lucy on Myspace"

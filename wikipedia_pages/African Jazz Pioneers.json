The band was founded in the 1980s by Her Excellency Queeneth Ndaba, who envisioned reviving the vibrant 1950s and 1960s South African jazz scene. Her mission was to recreate the joy and energy of that period's live performances, blending the big band sound with the traditional Majuba tempos and Marabi influences.\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, Dorkay House served as a haven for South African music legends like Dollar Brand, Kippie Moeketsi, Miriam Makeba, Ntemi Edmund Piliso, Dudu Pukwana, Hugh Masekela, Wilson Silgee, Zacks Nkosi, and Jonas Gwangwa. These musicians led South Africa’s music scene, innovatively merging American big band elements with local styles. However, the decline of big bands began in the 1960s, paralleling the demolition of Sophiatown between 1955 and 1960.\nIn June 1981, Bra Ntemi Piliso, a celebrated marabi saxophonist, re-united members of the Alexandra All-Stars band under the banner of the African Jazz Pioneers. Returning to Dorkay House, the group included seasoned marabi musicians and younger players drawn to the style. Their first performance as the African Jazz Pioneers was at a Roman Catholic church in Alexandra, Johannesburg. Despite the challenges posed by apartheid-era pass laws, censorship, and systemic discrimination, the band persisted and developed their unique township jazz sound.\nUnder Her Excellency Queeneth Ndaba’s leadership, the band gained prominence, reaching greater heights through her relentless dedication. By 1986, they toured Botswana, and international acclaim followed their performance at the CASA Conference in Amsterdam in 1987. Queeneth played a significant role in navigating these early opportunities, helping the band transition to global stages.\nIn the 1990s, as cultural boycotts eased, the African Jazz Pioneers toured extensively, performing at festivals in France, Japan, Switzerland, England, Spain, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands. They shared stages with legends like Youssou N'Dour, Quincy Jones, Gilberto Gil, Nina Simone, and Chick Corea.\nThe band’s music, deeply rooted in marabi, evolved to incorporate the instrumental depth of big swing bands like Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Bra Ntemi Piliso, who joined the band shortly after its formation, became its driving force. Though musicians came and went, Bra Ntemi ensured the continuity of the band's sound until his passing on December 18, 2000. He was honored as one of South Africa’s leading saxophonists by Minister Ben Ngubane in August 2000.\nHer Excellency Queeneth Ndaba’s foundational vision and Bra Ntemi’s leadership ensured the band's longevity. In 2001, the Ikageng Jazz Festival, dubbed \"The Night of the Pioneers,\" was established to honor their legacy, with the band closing each edition as the top act. More recently, the African Jazz Pioneers have performed for prominent figures, including the Flemish Minister of Culture, the President of the European Parliament, and former South African President Thabo Mbeki.\nHer Excellency Queeneth Ndaba's significant contributions and leadership remain integral to the band's legacy as they continue to celebrate and share the golden era of South African jazz with the world.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe African Jazz Pioneers are: \n\nNtemi Piliso – bandleader, guitar\nSam Shabangu – tenor sax\nTimothy Ndaba– alto sax\nBheki Buthelezi – alto sax\nLevy Kgasi – trumpet (Died 07 August 2016)\nSphiwe Mkhize– trumpet (Left band)\nPhillip Tau – bass (Died)\nMadoda Gxabeka – drums\nXolani Maseti – keyboards (Left band)\nBheki Khoza – guitar\nKenneth Motshabib Mosito - Keyboards\nSipho Mtshali\nSam Shabangu\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1991 – African Jazz Pioneers\n1992 – Live at the Montreux Jazz Festival\n1993 – Sip 'n Fly\n1996 – Shufflin' Joe\n1999 – Afrika Vukani\n2004 – 76–3rd Avenue\n2005 – Alextown with Ernest Ranglin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAfrican Jazz Pioneers discography at Discogs \n\"African Jazz Pioneers\".

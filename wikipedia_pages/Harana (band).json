    "text": "Harana was an all-male vocal group from the Philippines. It is under ABS-CBN and Star Music.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut ===\nStar Music' head, Roxy Liquigan shared that initially it was Joseph and Bryan who inspired the formation of the boyband.\n\n“Last year kasi, may nakita akong video sa party ni Arjo Atayde. May video na sumasayaw si Bryan at si Joseph Marco na parang nagbo-boy band. So nagkaroon ako ng idea when we talked kami sa buong Star Music. Meron tayo Gimme 5, ‘yung mga teeners. Ang wala sa industry natin ‘yung boy band na mga gwapo at nakakakanta at parang suave lang, Mr. Suave lang dating sa atin.” — he related.\n“Last year, I saw one of this video in Arjo Atayde's party. In that video, Bryan is dancing and Joseph is having like a boy-band thing. So here comes this idea when we talked about things together with everyone in Star Music. We have Gimme 5, the teens. The thing we don't have in our industry is a boy band who are handsome and singers who have that Mr. Suave look in them.” — he related.\nMichael came into the picture when Star Music was looking for an artist to sing Joven Tan's “Pare Mahal Mo Raw Ako,” an entry at the 2014 Himig Handog P-Pop Love Songs. Marlo then completed the group when he finished shooting for hit daytime show, Be Careful with My Heart.\n\n\n=== 2015–2018 ===\nASAP launched their newest boy group called “Harana” with members, Joseph Marco, Bryan Santos, Michael Pangilinan and Marlo Mortel with their carrier single, “Number One”.

The group also showed that they’re the all-in-one package, showing off their charm, good looks and notable singing voices as they performed their debut single “Number One” at the OPM Fresh press conference last April 28.\nThey performed recently at the “Most Wanted” concert of Daniel Padilla at the SM Mall Of Asia Arena last June 13, 2015.\nHarana disbanded in 2018.

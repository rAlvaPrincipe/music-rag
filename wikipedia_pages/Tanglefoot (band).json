    "text": "Tanglefoot was a Canadian folk band from Owen Sound, Ontario. Formed in Peterborough in the early 1980s by schoolteachers Joe Grant, Bob Wagar, and Tim Rowat to play traditional music, they became a five-piece band playing largely original music. They regularly toured Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe band has toured frequently throughout Canada and the United States, and also regularly in the UK. The band's song subjects are largely derived from history, especially Canadian history. Subject have included the Frank Slide, The War of 1812, Laura Secord, the first flight in Canada, and the tale of Sir John A Macdonald's wife Agnes Macdonald riding the cowcatcher across Canada.\nTanglefoot's lineup from 2007 on was: Steve Ritchie (guitar and whistle), the band's longest-serving member, Al Parrish (double bass), Terry Young (multi-instrumentalist incl guitar, mandolin, banjo, harmonica, whistle), Sandra Swannell (fiddle and viola), and Rob Ritchie (piano), returning after a five-year hiatus to replace departing pianist Bryan Weirmier. All the members sang and all, to varying degrees, wrote for the band.\nAfter performing for nearly three decades, Tanglefoot ended their run with a pair of farewell concerts at the Roxy Theatre in Owen Sound, Ontario. In a comment on 27 June 2009 Al Parrish said that there was no bitterness in the breakup, but after more than twenty years the time had come to call it a day. Parrish also said there was a possibility of reunion gigs in the future, but nothing was planned.\nIn October 2010, all five band members appeared together back at the Roxy Theatre for a leukemia fundraiser. The concert was billed as \"The My Sweet Patootie Show with special guests, Al Parrish, Rob Ritchie & Steve Ritchie\". Organized by former Tanglefoot members Sandra Swannell and Terry Young (who had founded their own group My Sweet Patootie), the concert featured all five performers in a variety of configurations but they played only a couple of Tanglefoot songs and the event was not particularly a \"Tanglefoot reunion\".\nIn September 2012, the founding members of Tanglefoot (Joe Grant, Tim Rowat and Bob Wagar) were inducted into the Pathway of Fame in Peterborough, Ontario.\nThree longstanding members of Tanglefoot – guitarist/vocalist Steve Ritchie, bassist/vocalist Al Parrish and keyboardist/vocalist Rob Ritchie teamed up with drummer/percussionist/vocalist Beaker Granger in 2012 and currently perform and record as RPR.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDance Like Flames – Released by Borealis Records in 2006; BCD-179CD\nWay More Live – Released on DVD by Borealis Records in 2004; BDVD001\nCaptured Alive – Released by Borealis Records in 2003; BCD-157CD\nAgnes on the Cowcatcher – Released by Borealis Records in 2002; BCD-143CD\nFull Throated Abandon – Released by Borealis Records in 1999; BCD-115CD\nThe Music in the Wood – Released by Tanglefoot Media in 1996; TML14-0896CD\nVoyageurs et Vagabonds: Songs of the Voyageurs – Released by Ooze River Music 1995; ORM8-989\nSaturday Night in Hardwood Lake – Released by Tanglefoot Media in 1994; TML12-1194CD\nGrain of Salt – Released by Ooze River Music 1992; ORM11-1192CD\nVoyageurs & Vagabonds (cassette) – Released by Ooze River Music 1987; ORM5-287\nSongs of the River (cassette) – Released by Ooze River Music 1984; ORM-002\nIgg's Pig: Songs and Stories for Young Canadians' – Released by Waterloo Music 1984; WR-8030\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site at the Wayback Machine (archived 28 February 2013)\nAllMusic's article on Tanglefoot"

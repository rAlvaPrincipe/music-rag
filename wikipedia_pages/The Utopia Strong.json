    "text": "The Utopia Strong are a British electronic band formed in Glastonbury, England in 2018. The group consists of Steve Davis, Kavus Torabi, and Michael J. York. They released their self-titled debut album in 2019 and their second, International Treasure, in 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Utopia Strong originated from an experimental improvised session in Glastonbury on the evening of 2 January 2018. Steve Davis, a six-time World Snooker Champion, was recognised for his love of progressive rock, soul and jazz-funk. He booked the French progressive rock band Magma to play three sold-out nights at the Bloomsbury Theatre and later became a DJ with the radio show Interesting Alternative on Phoenix FM. At a Magma gig, Davis bonded with Iranian-born musician Kavus Torabi, a storied guitarist with Gong and Cardiacs. Davis and Torabi met Coil's Michael J. York after DJing at the 2017 Glastonbury Festival, and the three decided to form a band.\nThe Utopia Strong released their self-titled debut album on 13 September 2019 on Rocket Recordings. The album features a guest vocal appearance by Mediæval Bæbes' Katharine Blake.\n\nThe Utopia Strong's second album International Treasure was released in 2022. The Quietus listed the album at number 25 on their Albums Of The Year So Far Chart 2022. The band appeared on BBC Breakfast on 25 March 2023. They supported Steve Hillage's 2023 UK tour, with Torabi also a member of Hillage's backing band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nThe Utopia Strong (2019)\nInternational Treasure (2022)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nAlphabet of the Magi (2020)\nDreamsweeper (2020)\nNinth Art (2021)\nGyre (2023)\nThe BBC Sessions (2024)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Brainsurgeons 3\" (2019, The Utopia Strong)\n\"Konta Chorus\" (2019, The Utopia Strong)\n\"Strange Altar\" (2019)\n\"Shepherdess\" (2022, International Treasure)\n\"Castalia\" (2022, International Treasure)\n\"Gatekeeper\" (2023, Golden Lion Sounds)\n\"Lamp of Glory\" (2024, The BBC Sessions)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n\"Rechargeable\" (2019, with Snapped Ankles)\n\n\n=== Appearances ===\n\"Harpies\" (2023, Rocket Recordings: Launch300)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Utopia Strong on Bandcamp\nThe Utopia Strong at AllMusic\nThe Utopia Strong discography at MusicBrainz"

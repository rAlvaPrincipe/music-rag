Scoring hit records since the late 1960s, they are best known for their two number-one R&B singles, \"And the Beat Goes On\" in 1979 and \"Rock Steady\" in 1987. The Whispers scored 15 top-ten R&B singles, and 8 top-ten R&B albums with two of them, The Whispers and Love Is Where You Find It, reaching the No. 1 spot. They have earned two platinum and five gold albums by the RIAA.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe Whispers formed in 1963 in Watts, California. The original members included identical twin brothers Wallace \"Scotty\" and Walter Scott, along with Gordy Harmon, Marcus Hutson, and Nicholas Caldwell. After being invited to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1966 by Sly Stone, the group relocated to that area where they began developing a reputation as a show-stopping live act. Walter Scott was drafted to serve in the Vietnam War during that period for eighteen months, returning to the group in 1969 after discharge. After Harmon injured his larynx in a driving accident in 1973, he was replaced by former Friends of Distinction member Leaveil Degree.\nAfter a series of singles on Los Angeles label, Dore, the group signed to a small L.A. label, Soul Clock, run by producer Ron Carson, who was responsible for their breakthrough hit, \"Seems Like I Got to Do Wrong\" in 1970. Moving to the larger New York-based Janus label, they continued to be produced by Carson, before he sold all of his recordings to Janus with the group then recording mainly in Philadelphia in the mid-1970s.\nIn 1978, the group signed to Dick Griffey's SOLAR Records. They hit #1 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart in 1979-80 with \"And the Beat Goes On\" / \"Can You Do the Boogie\" / \"Out the Box\". In the UK, \"And the Beat Goes On\" peaked at #2 and \"It's a Love Thing\" became their second top 10 in 1981 peaking at #9. In 1987, their song \"Rock Steady\" reached #7 on the US  Billboard Hot 100, #10 on the US Cash Box Top 100 and #1 on the R&B chart.\nThe Whispers later established their own production company, Satin Tie Productions, through which they released their independent 2006 album For Your Ears Only.\nThe group opened Game 2 of the 1989 World Series at Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum with their rendition of the National Anthem.\nMarcus Hutson left the group in 1992 due to prostate cancer.

    "text": "The Vancouver Metropolitan Orchestra (VMO) is an orchestra based in the Lower Mainland area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The VMO is a registered not-for-profit charitable organization, and was founded in 2003. \nIn the decade, the VMO has continually provided job opportunities to the alumni of the Music School of the University of British Columbia, which includes the players, administration staffs and the board of directors. \nVMO performs music from the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods. Contemporary and popular music is also performed, in concerts with opera companies, choirs, and traditional folk music groups. \nKenneth Hsieh has been the music director since the orchestra's founding, and is the principal conductor. Ken's style of conducting always brings energy to the audience, as well as creates the perfect atmosphere for the players. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

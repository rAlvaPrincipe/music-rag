    "text": "Universal Congress Of are an American jazz ensemble from Los Angeles, formed in 1986.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe project was started by guitarist-vocalist Joe Baiza after his previous group Saccharine Trust went on hiatus. The new ensemble continued to develop the fusion of free jazz and punk rock that Saccharine Trust began to explore. Congress' approach to free jazz has earned them comparisons to Ornette Coleman and James Blood Ulmer, while the group themselves have pointed to Albert Ayler as a primary source of inspiration. The band's name was chosen \"to reflect the open-ended nature of its music.\"\nThe original line-up consisted of Baiza, Ralph Gorodetsky (bass), Jason Kahn (drums), Steve Moss (saxophone). Moss had played in an earlier incarnation of Saccharine Trust alongside Baiza.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn an issue of Mountain Bike, bassist Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine spoke of his admiration of the band's funky and jazz tinged style.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nJoe Baiza & The Universal Congress Of (1987, SST)\nProsperous and Qualified (1988, SST)\nThe Sad and Tragic Demise of Big Fine Hot Salty Black Wind (1991, Enemy)\nThe Eleventh-Hour Shine-On (1992, Enemy)\nEPs\nThis Is Mecolodics (1988, SST)\nLive albums\nSparkling Fresh (1998, Hazelwood)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nallmusic Biography"

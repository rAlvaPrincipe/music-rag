The audition process, which saw more than 1,000 people attend, took over nine months. Just George, Parker and Sykes were involved at the start, and Kaneswaran and McGuiness joined later through the process. The group revealed in their autobiography that after they were informed of the line-up, seven more people were re-auditioned before they were signed to Maximum Artist Management and Geffen Records.\nThe group were credited with co-writing five of the thirteen tracks on the album.

In May 2012, \"Chasing the Sun\" was released as the album's lead single, and the third single from the band's The Wanted: The EP in the United States. Around this time, the band also premiered a brand new track called \"Satellite\", which was co-written by Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic. In August 2012, the band filmed a music video in Los Angeles, reportedly for their brand new single, \"I Found You\". However, when the video for \"I Found You\" was released in October 2012, it was a different one. The band later revealed that they had reshot the video in London, not being satisfied with the first one. The original was later released as the \"fan version\" on Vevo. \"I Found You\" was released on 5 November 2012 as the album's second single. The band confirmed in September 2012 that the album would contain a number of collaborations, including tracks with Pitbull, LMFAO, Chris Brown, Rita Ora and Dappy. In November 2012, the band announced that the album had been pushed back from the original release of 3 December 2012 to February 2013 at their request; the reason stated for this delay was to perfect the album, and \"tweak out a few insecurities involving certain tracks\".

The tour included shows in the UK, mainland Europe, the US, and Canada.\nThe band originally announced in January 2014 that they were taking a hiatus in order to pursue individual solo projects. In a 2014 interview with The Sun, George stated that part of the group's reasoning for taking a hiatus was due to the success of One Direction, saying \"One Direction are a phenomenon that no one else can compete with. They've taken over the market. We have our own fans, who we love, but we couldn't stop things from happening\". Parker later echoed George's statements in an interview with Digital Spy, stating \"For The Wanted to try and compete against one of the biggest bands in the world ... it's almost impossible. I don't think any band out there can compete with them at the moment\".\n\n\n=== 2021–present: Reunion, Most Wanted: The Greatest Hits and Parker's death ===\nSince 2020, the band had been teasing a reunion. On 5 September 2021, it was reported that a reunion would be officially announced on 8 September, with new music and performances announced, including raising money for cancer charities in support of band member Tom Parker, who was diagnosed with an inoperable stage 4 glioblastoma in late 2020.\nOn 8 September 2021, it was announced that the band would return with a greatest hits album titled Most Wanted: The Greatest Hits, set to be released on 8 November.

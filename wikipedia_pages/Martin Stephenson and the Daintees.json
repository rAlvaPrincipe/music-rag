    "text": "Martin Stephenson & the Daintees is a British rock/folk/pop band combining elements of \"rockabilly, show tunes, rootsy pop, straight-ahead rock and punk\". The band is fronted by songwriter/guitarist Martin Stephenson.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nThe band was signed to a recording contract with Kitchenware Records and released their first single in 1982. Like other Kitchenware acts the group had its origins in the North East England. The band enjoyed a high critical profile and some minor commercial success. Their best-selling and most acclaimed album is Boat to Bolivia released in 1986. In June 1989, Stephenson took part in that year's Glastonbury Festival. They recorded three further albums – Gladsome, Humour & Blue in 1988, Salutation Road, produced by Pete Anderson, in 1990 and The Boy's Heart in 1992 – but sales fell short of expectations and the band was dropped by their label.\nAfter parting company with Kitchenware, Stephenson disbanded the group in 1992, but continued to record both solo and as part of a group. The Daintees reformed in 2000.\nIn April 2012, Stephenson completed an eleven-date high-profile tour with The Daintees playing The Boat to Bolivia album in full to critical acclaim. The touring Daintees line up since November 2010 features original guitarist John Steel (Boat to Bolivia/Jackdaw4), John's wife Kate Stephenson (Midge Ure/Sam Brown/Jackdaw4) on drums, and Lou Short (Martin Stephenson 1997/2000) on bass guitar who left the group March 2013.\nDaintees have signed a major deal with Absolute music and also have a new agent Neil O'Brien They have remained active in recent years and, in 2018, performed a multi date tour \"Gladsome, Humour and Blue 30th Anniversary\" tour which culminated in a rapturous reception at the Sage on Tyneside on 8 December that year. This performance was filmed and released on DVD entitled Gladsome 30.\nIn the same year the actor, comedian and musician Billy Connolly filmed with Stephenson for the two part documentary about Glaswegian's life, in which Stephenson performed the track \"Rain\" and Connolly described him warmly him as his idea of a musician and songwriter.\n\n\n== Martin Stephenson ==\nMartin George Stephenson was born on 27 July 1961, to Alfred and Francis Stephenson in Durham. In January 1990, he married Angela Cape who appeared on the cover of the album Boat to Bolivia, though they later divorced. Stephenson has two daughters. Stephenson's work has increasingly drawn on folk music and traditional musical roots, and his performances have often taken in low-key live events and venues for recording. He has recorded albums in a Scottish church and a disused lighthouse. Martin Stephenson currently lives in the highlands in Scotland.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStephenson's albums have been released on various UK and US labels, including Kitchenware, London, Capitol USA, Floating World Records, Fresh Ear Records, Ramseur, and most recently, his Barbaraville label with Voiceprint.\n\n\n=== Martin Stephenson and The Daintees albums ===\nBoat to Bolivia (1986)\nGladsome, Humour & Blue (1988) # 39 UK Albums Chart\nSalutation Road (1990)\nThe Boy's Heart (1992)\nLive in the 21st Century (2001)\nWestern Eagle (2008)\nLive at Town & Country Club, Camden Town 1990 (2011)\nCalifornia Star (2012)\nHaunted Highway (2015)\nBoat to Bolivia 30th Anniversary Edition (new recording) (2016)\nBayswater Road (2017)\nGladsome, Humour & Blue 30th Anniversary Edition (new recording) (2018)\nChi Chi and the Jaguar (2019)\nSalutation Road 30th Anniversary Edition (new recording) (2020)\nThe Boy's Heart 30th Anniversary Edition (new recording) (2021)\nHowdy Honcho (2021)\nYou Belong To Blue (2023)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nThere Comes a Time – The Best Of...

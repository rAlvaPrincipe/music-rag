    "text": "Angerme (アンジュルム, Anjurumu), formerly Smileage (スマイレージ, Sumairēji, stylized as S/mileage, from 2009–2015), is a Japanese idol girl group from the musical collective Hello! Project, which originally consisted of four former Hello! Pro Egg (Hello! Project trainees) members that left Egg in 2010 and became full-time members of Hello! Project. In 2010, they won the Japan Record Award for Best New Artist. In 2011, five new girls were added to the group as part of the second generation, with two being former Egg members and three new girls. In 2014, three new members joined the group as third generation members.\nSince the formation of Angerme, there have been eleven generations and fourteen departures. As of 20 June 2024, the total number of members of the group stands at ten members.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Smileage era ===\n\n\n==== 2009: Formation ====\nOn April 4, Japanese music producer Tsunku announced on his blog that a new girl group consisting of Hello! Pro Egg members would be formed. The members would consist of Ayaka Wada, Yuuka Maeda, and Kanon Fukuda, all formerly of Shugo Chara Egg!, as well as fellow Egg Saki Ogawa. Ayaka was the designated group leader. A month later, on May 7, 2009, he revealed that the group would be called \"Smileage\". The name is a portmanteau of the English words \"smile\", \"mileage\", and \"age\", and together the name means \"the age of smiles\". In 2009 the group released three indie singles: \"Ama no Jaku\", \"Asu wa Date na no ni, Ima Sugu Koe ga Kikitai\" and \"Suki-chan\"\n\n\n==== 2010: Debut ====\nAfter releasing three singles, Tsunku announced that the group would become a full-time group in the spring of 2010 and their debut was set for May 2010. A \"Smile Campaign\" (笑顔キャンペーン, \"Egao Campaign\") was embarked upon to collect 10,000 smiles from people, where fans were asked to send in photographs of themselves smiling, compiled into a big mosaic. The group made their official event debut in Nagoya on March 19, with their fourth single \"Otona ni Narutte Muzukashii!!!\", released March 14, their first release on the Up-Front Works label. The result of the campaign was announced during the joint Smileage and Erina Mano concert on April 3. It was then announced that the group would be leaving from Hello! Pro Eggs.\nTheir first major single, \"Yume Miru Fifteen\", was released on May 26. Their debut album, Warugaki 1, was released on December 8, 2010. On December 30, Smileage received the Japan Record Award for Best New Artist.\n\n\n==== 2011–2014: The second generation ====\nOn May 29, 2011, Smileage revealed at their first-anniversary event that they would be holding auditions for new members to add to the four-member line-up and that some of the members would depart.

Project Egg after her recovery.\nStarting September 18, a second Smile Campaign was held by the new members to determine their place as official members in the group.

    "text": "Chat Pile is an American rock band from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The band is composed of four members using the pseudonyms Raygun Busch (vocals), Luther Manhole (guitar), Stin (bass), and Cap'n Ron (drums).\nSigned to The Flenser, their debut album God's Country was released in 2022, followed by Cool World in 2024. The band self-identifies as belonging to the noise rock subgenre, but external publications have labeled them as sludge metal.\n\n\n== History ==\nChat Pile formed in 2019 and took their name from piles of chat, byproducts of lead-zinc mining which are commonly found throughout Northeastern Oklahoma. The band was founded in Oklahoma City, but its members grew up in other parts of the state; Raygun Busch from Ponca City, Luther Manhole from Moore and the brothers Stin and Cap'n Ron from Asher. The members initially adopted stage names to avoid being identified by their employers at the time. Stin acts as the band's manager.\nTheir debut EP This Dungeon Earth was released in May 2019. The band performed their first live concert in July 2019 at the venue 89th Street in Oklahoma City. When trying to promote their music, the band was originally rejected by Oklahoma City's music scene, which a band member claimed revolved around only hardcore punk and shoegaze. The band found successful promotion when This Dungeon Earth reached the top of Rate Your Music's weekly charts in a fluke of timing. Their second EP Remove Your Skin Please was released in November 2019, and the band released a compilation of both EPs on vinyl and cassette the following February.\nSan Francisco-based label The Flenser signed Chat Pile in September 2020 and released the band's debut single, \"Roots Bloody Roots\", a cover of the song by the Brazilian thrash metal band Sepultura, in July 2021. A year later, the band released their debut album, God's Country. The album received wide acclaim, receiving the \"Best New Music\" distinction on Pitchfork.\nThe band released the soundtrack to the film Tenkiller, which Busch stars in, in November 2022 as a Bandcamp exclusive. Brothers in Christ, a split EP with Kansas City band Nerver, was released in April 2023. Chat Pile's European tour debut came in April 2023 Roadburn Festival in Tilburg, Netherlands, first performing a secret set before playing the main stage the day after.\nTheir second full-length album, Cool World, was released through The Flenser on October 11, 2024. The band was also named as headliners for the 2025 Roadburn Festival.\n\n\n== Musical style and influences ==\nIn interviews, the band has described the themes of their music as \"trying to capture the anxiety and fear of seeing the world fall apart,\" and \"very consciously try to express and represent the feeling of living in the southern plains.\" They also take inspiration from other pieces of media including In a Glass Cage, Mysterious Skin, L’Humanite, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Continental Drift by Russell Banks, and Woman at Point Zero by Nawal El Saadawi. \nThe band describes their music as noise rock while acknowledging that audiences have also labeled them as sludge metal. Vocalist and songwriter Raygun Busch named Big Black as \"probably our biggest influence.\" The Flenser describes Chat Pile as \"[c]hanneling everything from the oppressive sludgy beat downs of Godflesh, the vulgar absurdity of The Jesus Lizard and the rebellious, post-modern experimentation of Sonic Youth\".\nAccording to guitarist Luther Manhole, the band's sound also contains elements of post-punk, nu metal and grunge. Bassist Stin also cites Korn as an influence with \"no shame\" but is the only member of the band who is a Korn fan. \"Most nu-metal is completely unlistenable, especially anything made after 1999,\" he said.\nBusch's vocals are influenced by David Yow of The Jesus Lizard and Scratch Acid, Black Francis of Pixies and H.R. of Bad Brains. \n\n\n== Band members ==\nRaygun Busch — vocals\nLuther Manhole — guitar\nStin — bass\nCap'n Ron — drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nGod's Country (2022)\nCool World (2024)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nThis Dungeon Earth (2019)\nRemove Your Skin Please (2019)\nPortrayal of Guilt/Chat Pile Split (with Portrayal of Guilt) (2021)\nTenkiller Motion Picture Soundtrack (2022)\nBrothers in Christ (with Nerver) (2023)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Roots Bloody Roots\" (2021)\n\"Slaughterhouse\" (2022)\n\"Why\" (2022)\n\"Wicked Puppet Dance\" (2022)\n\"Tenkiller/Lake Time (Mr. Rodan)\" (2022)\n\"I Am Dog Now\" (2024)\n\"Masc\" (2024)\n\"Funny Man\" (2024)\n\"Scentless Apprentice\" (2024)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

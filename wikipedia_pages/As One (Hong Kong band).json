    "text": "As One (Korean: 에즈 원, stylized as AS ONE), also known as AS1 in South Korea to avoid confusion with Korean girlband As One, was a Hong Kong Cantopop girl group formed by Sun Entertainment Culture and choreographer Sunny Wong.\nThe meaning behind the group's name is based on the concept of unity, with the members united together \"as one\". The group was consisted of four members; Shin, Oli, Elfa and Nata. The group promoted as a quartet for two years until Oli's departure in August 2014 to pursue her studies. Subsequently, two new members (Chloe and Kayan) joined the group in March 2015 after emerging as champions of a scouting audition. Elfa announced her temporary hiatus from the group in May 2015 due to sustained injuries. As of 15 May 2015, As One is promoting as a quartet with Shin, Nata, Chloe and Kayan.\nThey were trained in Korea in 2015 and made a comeback in both South Korea and Hong Kong. On the other hand, Shin participated in South Korea Mnet's survival show Produce 101 in 2016. During Shin's absence, this team is working with the remaining 3 members. The band has now disbanded.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\nExtended Plays\n2013: AsOnE\nCantonese Singles\n2012: \"Catch Me Up\"\n2013: \"Red Hot Hits 2013\"\n2013: \"4Ever\"\n2014: \"Be With U\"\n2014: \"New Girl\"\n2015: \"Candy Ball\"\n2016: \"Hey ya\"\nKorean Singles\n2015: \"캔디볼 (Candy Ball)\"\nOther Songs\n2014: \"Let's Goal\"\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\n(*) Still charting\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== Books ==\n2014: \"Girls' Anecdotes\"\n\n\n== Endorsements ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAs One on Facebook\nAs One on Weibo (in Chinese)\nAs One's channel on YouTube"

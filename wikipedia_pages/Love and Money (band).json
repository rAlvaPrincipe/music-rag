    "text": "Love and Money are a Scottish rock/soul/funk band, formed in 1985 in Glasgow, Scotland. The band was formed by three former members of Friends Again (singer-songwriter and guitarist James Grant, drummer Stuart Kerr and keyboardist Paul McGeechan) along with bassist Bobby Paterson, who replaced Friends Again's Neil Cunningham and who had been a member of Set the Tone, a band previously signed to Island Records in 1983.\nIn their initial nine years together they recorded four moderately successful albums, three of which were released in the United States, and had six chart hits in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== All You Need Is... Love And Money ==\nSigning to Phonogram's Mercury Records in the United Kingdom, they recorded \"Candybar Express\", with production from Duran Duran's Andy Taylor, and this recording became their first hit receiving airplay in the U.S. and reaching number 56 in the UK Singles Chart in the spring of 1986. Shortly afterwards they released their debut album, All You Need Is... produced by Tom Dowd but this failed to chart. Follow up singles \"Dear John\" and \"River of People\" were released to modest success. In September 1986, the group played an Artists Against Apartheid concert at Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow, alongside acts such as The Big Dish and Lloyd Cole.  The band also had a support slot with U2 at Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh.\n\n\n== Strange Kind of Love ==\nThe 1988 follow-up album Strange Kind of Love (which featured Toto's Jeff Porcaro on drums following the departure of Kerr, as well as Rick Derringer and an uncredited appearance from Donald Fagen) was overseen by Steely Dan producer Gary Katz, and featured the hit \"Halleluiah Man\", which helped to establish a sizeable following for the band.  This single was a minor hit in UK (No. 63) but was more successful in Continental Europe and in Oceania, reaching the Top 50 (and sometimes the Top 40) in 1989; just missing the Top 20 in Italy. \"Strange Kind of Love\" and \"Jocelyn Square\" also charted in the UK, although they did not break into the Top 40.\nThe band toured to promote Strange Kind of Love, including the United States and Japan, and garnered support slots with Tina Turner, Simply Red and B. B. King.  Part of the band's performance at the Eden Court Theatre in Inverness was filmed for BBC Scotland's Sounds of Eden programme.  A half-hour set from the band also featured on the Night Network television show and they performed the \"Strange Kind of Love\" single on Wogan.\nStrange Kind of Love, which has sold in excess of 250,000 copies worldwide, was re-released in April 2010, with added demos and new sleeve notes from James Grant, Paul McGeechan and Gary Katz.\n\n\n== The Mother's Boy ==\nThe band, now supplemented by permanent drummer Gordon Wilson and rhythm guitarist Douglas MacIntyre, returned to the studio to record the follow-up, to be entitled The Mother's Boy, but the songs met disapproval from Phonogram.  The release was scrapped and the band returned to the studio.  Several of the tracks including proposed album opener, \"Hubcap to Blue Town\", \"Blue Eyed World\" (played on the Strange Kind of Love tour), and \"True Believer\", reappeared as B-sides to the singles from the eventual follow-up Dogs in the Traffic. \"Pappa Death\" and \"Winter\" also were included on Dogs in the Traffic, and \"No Chicane\" on Grant's solo debut Sawdust in My Veins.  Other tracks, including \"Amaranth\", were released on the 2012 release, The Devil's Debt.\n\n\n== Dogs in the Traffic ==\nDogs in the Traffic was included in the All Time Top 100 Scottish Pop and Rock albums in The Scotsman (at number 30). The band gave a pre-release playthrough of the album at City Halls in Candleriggs, Glasgow, which included an encore featuring Tom Waits' \"Clap Hands\" and Bob Dylan's \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\". Three singles were released from the album, \"My Love Lives in a Dead House\", the Wishing Waters EP on which \"Looking for Angeline\" was the lead track, and \"Winter\".\n\n\n== Littledeath and split ==\nLove and Money's fourth album, Littledeath (1993) was released independently on Iona Gold records and featured the single, \"The Last Ship on the River\".  The album sold 25,000, around one tenth of the sales for Strange Kind of Love and the group were subsequently released from Mercury. Bassist Bobby Paterson had split from the band to form a career in bar management and did not feature on this album. The band's guitarist Douglas MacIntyre played bass on the album. The remainder of the band went their separate ways in 1994, although they did regroup for one final gig at Glasgow Barrowland on 23 December 1994 entitled 'Love and Money: RIP'.\n\n\n== Reformation and The Devil's Debt ==\nLove and Money reformed 'for one night only' for a successful sell out show at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall as part of Celtic Connections 2011.  They played the albums Strange Kind of Love and Dogs in the Traffic in their entireties, and dedicated the song \"Walk The Last Mile\" to bassist Bobby Paterson, who had died in 2006.  The Strange Kind of Love portion of the show was later released on L&M recordings.  It was announced in March 2011, that the band would continue their reunion with a show at the Clyde Auditorium in Glasgow on 4 December 2011.\nThe band previewed its fifth studio album The Devil's Debt to a sold-out show at King Tuts Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow on 5 May 2012.  The album was released on Vertical Records in October 2012 to positive reviews.\nDouglas Macintyre was featured in the 'Pop Band' episode of the CBeebies My Story programme in late 2012.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Bobby Paterson ===\nRobert Armstrong Paterson was born in 1956 in Carntyne, Glasgow.

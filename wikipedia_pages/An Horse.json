    "text": "An Horse is an Australian pop and rock duo, formed in 2007 in Brisbane, Australia and founded by Kathleen \"Kate\" Cooper and Damon Cox. The duo has released three studio albums (Rearrange Beds in 2009, Walls in 2011 and Modern Air in 2019) and two 2009 hit singles (\"Camp Out\" and \"Postcards\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Becoming An Horse ===\nKathleen \"Kate\" Cooper and Damon Cox met while working at an independent record store called Skinny's in Brisbane, Australia. They began making music together in 2007, and set up a PA in the store, where they would rehearse after-hours and organise shows in the Brisbane area. \n\n\n=== 2007–2008: Not Really Scared ===\nThe duo's first recording was a 5 song EP, Not Really Scared, which was released by local Brisbane label Valve Records. Kathleen handed a rough mix version on CD to Tegan and Sara at the Canadian duo's in-store performance at Skinny's, and not long after received an invite for An Horse to open their Out of Hibernation US tour in April 2008. Off the back of that tour, they were the first duo to be signed to New York label Mom + Pop Music by Michael Goldstone. They returned to the US in October 2008 for tours with Bishop Allen and Jessica Lea Mayfield, while continuing to tour at home in Australia with Death Cab For Cutie, The New Pornographers and more.\n\n\n=== 2009–2010: Rearrange Beds ===\nTheir debut album, Rearrange Beds, was released on 17 March 2009 on the label Mom + Pop. It was recorded in Australia with ARIA award-winning Australian producer Magoo, and was mixed in Vancouver by Howard Redekopp. The album received favourable reviews from Pitchfork, Spin and Rolling Stone. Upon its release they appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman and continued with extensive US touring with acts including The Appleseed Cast, Silversun Pickups, Cage the Elephant, Wintersleep and Telekinesis. They also opened again for Tegan and Sara on Australian, UK and Canadian tours. 2010 touring included shows with Kaki King, Dashboard Confessional and The Big Pink. A 2010 Australian tour with Against Me! was scheduled, but was later cancelled. Cooper and Cox worked on writing their second album throughout 2010, and recording took place that summer in Vancouver with Howard Redekopp producing. 2010 also saw the band tour Germany, Austria and Switzerland extensively as Rearrange Beds saw a release on the Grand Hotel van Cleef label. Festival appearances included Gurten Festival in Bern, Switzerland and MELT! in Germany. A remix EP called Beds Rearranged was released on 23 March 2010. The EP includes remixes of songs from Rearrange Beds by artists such as RAC and Gerard Smith from TV on the Radio.\n\n\n=== 2011–2012: Walls ===\nAn Horse released their second album Walls on 26 April 2011, again through Mom + Pop. It debuted at number 17 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums Chart The opening-song, \"Dressed Sharply\", was selected as iTunes Single of the Week, and was also praised by NPR.

Meanwhile, Cox toured as a drummer for Kevin Devine and occasionally Tancred, as well as an auxiliary percussionist and drum tech for Brand New up to their 2017 tour.\n\n\n=== 2018: Return and \"Get Out Somehow\" ===\nOn 1 March 2018 the duo announced they were going to start playing again, beginning with three shows in Canada with Camp Cope.

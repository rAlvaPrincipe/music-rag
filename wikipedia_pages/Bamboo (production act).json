    "text": "Bamboo was a short-lived British house production act formed by producer Andrew Livingstone, formerly of Hed Boys (with Dave Lee/Joey Negro). It had a #2 hit in the UK Singles Chart with \"Bamboogie\" in 1998, which was based on a sample from the KC and the Sunshine Band's 1975 US #1 single \"Get Down Tonight\". The act's other hit single, also in 1998, was \"The Strutt\", which peaked at #36 and featured Erin Lordan on vocals.  Both singles were released on the VC Recordings label, a subsidiary label of Virgin Records. Livingstone also co-produced Take That's cover version of \"Relight My Fire\" in 1993 along with Dave Lee.\n\n\n== References =="

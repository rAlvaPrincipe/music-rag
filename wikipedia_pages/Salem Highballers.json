    "text": "The Salem Highballers was the recording name given to The McCray Family by Okeh Records, their recording label in the 1920s and 1930s. They traveled somewhat but did not stray far from their hometown of Salem, Virginia.\nAside from local performances and their \"Salem Highballers\" sides, The McCray family's biggest claims to fame were their radio programs, performed live on Roanoke's WDBJ between 1925 and 1930.\nThe lineup consisted of Henry McCray on violin, Fred McCray on guitar, Carl McCray on guitar, and Robert McCray on banjo. Carl, the last surviving member, died in 1984.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLornell, Kip (1989). Virginia's Blues, Country, and Gospel Records, 1902â€“1943: An Annotated Discography.

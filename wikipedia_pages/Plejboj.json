They were soon joined by saxophonist Dušan Petrović, a former Duh Nibor and Deca Loših Muzičara member. Together they had their first public appearance at the Brzi Bendovi Srbije festival held at the Dom Omladine in Belgrade, where, performing with kitschy clothes, attractive musical style, wigs and on-stage dancers, the band had easily drawn the attention of the public to themselves.\nThe following year, the band performed as a part of the Trinidad Trip band in the play Trinidad (Trinidad) which was directed in the BITEF theater by Milutin Petrović. The song \"Ja hoću mambo\" (\"I Want Mambo\"), performed with Branka Katić, Slobodan Ninković and Branko Vidaković on vocals, soon became a nationwide hit. The band also wrote music for a part of the Beogradske priče (Belgrade Stories) play.\n\n\n=== Official releases, breakup (1994-1999) ===\nThe debut album, Sviraj dečko (Play, Boy), released by B92 and DE Production in 1994, the band recorded featuring guest appearances by Veljko Nikolić \"Papa Nik\", piano on the track \"Sve ili ništa\" (\"All or Nothing\") and vibraphone on \"Carstvo čula\" (\"Empire of Sensations\"), Marko Milivojević, percussion on the tracks \"Grizi metak\" (\"Bite the Bullet\"), \"Bela koka\" (\"White Coca\") and \"Carstvo čula\" (\"Empire of Sensations\"), and Vlada Lešić, congas on \"Plejboj\" and percussion on \"Carstvo čula\".

During the same year, Plejboj appeared on the soundtrack and performed in the film Geto - Tajni život grada (Ghetto - A Secret City Life), however, the soundtrack album was never officially released.\nIn the meantime, the band appeared on several various artists compilations. The track \"Zajedno\" appeared on Radio BOOM 93 and B92 compilation Ovo je zemlja za nas?!? (This Is The Land For Us?!?) and the Radio Index compilation Nas slušaju svi, mi ne slušamo nikoga!

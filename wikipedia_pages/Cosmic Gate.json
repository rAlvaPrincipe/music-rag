    "text": "Cosmic Gate is a German DJ duo consisting of trance music producers Claus Terhoeven (born 1972) and Stefan Bossems (born 1967). Both hail from Krefeld, Germany.\nOn October 28, 2009, DJ Magazine announced the results of their annual Top 100 DJ Poll, with Ultra Records artist Cosmic Gate placed #19, 43 spots above the group's ranking the year before. For the 2010 DJ Magazine Top 100 DJ Poll, Cosmic Gate moved to #24.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCosmic Gate was formed in 1999 when Terhoeven (also known as Nic Chagall) and Bossems (also known as Bossi) decided to assemble a new project in the electronic music field.\nTheir first single was \"The Drums\", followed by \"Exploration of Space\", \"Mental Atmosphere\" and their \"Somewhere over the Rainbow\" remix using samples from the film The Wizard of Oz. However, Cosmic Gate did not become well known until their single \"Fire Wire\" was released in the UK in 2001.\nCosmic Gate have made many remixes for artists such as Tiësto (\"Urban Train\"), Ferry Corsten (\"Punk\"), Blank & Jones (\"DFF\"), Israel Kamakawiwo'ole (\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\"), Svenson & Gielen (\"Answer the Question\") and Vanessa-Mae (\"White Bird\").\nOver the past few years, Cosmic Gate's sound has developed and moved away from the harder edge trance through to their current, more subtle yet still driving energetic music style. Since their third studio album, Earth Mover, they started moving towards the Progressive Trance style. They have also led a trance podcast called Wake Your Mind Radio since 2014.\nIn 2015, they collaborated with Armin van Buuren on the trance track \"Embargo\", which was featured on Van Buuren's studio album \"Embrace\". Two years later, they announced their seventh studio album titled \"Materia\", which was released on January 20, 2017.\nIn 2018, Nic & Bossi were nominated for a Grammy Award For Best Remixed Recording for their remix of Gabriel & Dresden feat. Sub Teal \"Only Road\" on the Anjunabeats Label. They were the first ever trance artists to be nominated in this category.\n\n\n=== Touring ===\nThe pair have played over 1,000 gigs, typically performing between 100 and 130 nights a year. They have played at clubs such as Ministry of Sound, The Guvernment, and Privilege Ibiza. They have played alongside DJs such as Armin Van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, W&W and Hardwell.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\nRhythm & Drums (2001)\nNo More Sleep (2002)\nEarth Mover (2006)\nSign of the Times (2009)\nWake Your Mind (2011)\nStart to Feel (2014)\nMateria Chapter.One (2017)\nMateria Chapter.Two (2017)\n20 Years [Forward Ever Backward Never] (2019)\nMosaiik Chapter One (2021)\nMosaiik Chapter Two (2023)\n\n\n==== Compilation albums ====\nBack 2 the Future – The Classics from 1999–2003: Remixed (2011)\n\n\n==== DJ mixes ====\nMaxiMal in the Mix Vol. 5 (with Tillmann Uhrmacher) (2001)\nTechnics DJ Set Volume Three (with DJ Shog) (2001)\nTechno Club Vol. 14 – Talla 2XLC Welcomes Cosmic Gate (2001)\n3AM Rush (2002)\nBitte Ein Beat!

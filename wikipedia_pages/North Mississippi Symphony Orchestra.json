Lagrone. The orchestra was founded in 1971.\n\n\n== Musical Director and Conductor ==\nSteven Byess is the current Music Director and has led the TSO since 2006. He is the Cover Conductor for the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Opera Conductor for the Cleveland Institute of Music and the California State University - Los Angeles, in addition to the Conductor at the International Vocal Arts Institute in Tel Aviv, Israel and the former Music Director of the Ohio Light Opera.\n\nThe previous conductor of the Tupelo Symphony Orchestra was Louis Lane, a recipient of the Mahler medal. He was the principal guest conductor of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra from 1973 to 1978 and co-conductor of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra from 1977 through 1983. Mr. Lane became Music Director Laureate of the Tupelo Symphony Orchestra in 2006.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nDuring his lifetime, each concert was reviewed in the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal by a known local music authority, Robert Bruce Smith, IV.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nofficial website\nhttp://www.link-centre.org/organizations/arts/tupelosymphony.html\nhttp://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Lane-Louis.htm\nhttp://www.stevenbyess.com/Content.asp?cid=1&sid=894679038"

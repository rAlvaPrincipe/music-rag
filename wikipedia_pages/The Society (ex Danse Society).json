    "text": "The Society are an English gothic rock band, formed in Barnsley in 2014 after Paul Gilmartin resigned from Danse Society. The current lineup is Jonathan Cridford (vocals), Elliot Wheeler (guitar), Darran Guy (keyboards), Ade Clark (bass guitar) and Paul Gilmartin (drums). Jonathan Cridford replaced Brian Jay in 2016. J. Cridford left after his last show with the band at Old School House in Barnsley, August 2018. Paul Gregory of Expelaires and 3,000 Revs replaced him on vocals. More guitar was added to the line up with the inclusion of David Wolfenden from Red Lorry Yellow Lorry. This line up opened the new version of Whitby Goth Weekend, now called Tomorrow's Ghost, in November 2018. \n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== First incarnation ===\n(see separate article The Danse Society)\n\n\n=== Reformation ===\nPaul Gilmartin, after leaving The Danse Society in January 2014, recruited a strong male vocal, initially provided by Brian Jay, which proved popular with fans old and new as well as live audiences. The live band also began to take shape with the recruitment of Darran Guy on keyboards, Ade Clarke on bass and Elliott Wheeler on guitar.\nPaul Gilmartin's album Reincarnated, featuring some early songs and many new ones, with lyrics by Gilmartin and scored by the band, was released in 2015.\nWhile this incarnation of the band gained momentum, extensively touring the UK and Europe, playing alongside such bands as Balaam And The Angel, Chameleons Vox, Spear Of Destiny and Theatre Of Hate, a legal battle started for the sole usage of the band name.\nDuring 2016, Brian Jay stepped aside to allow a new frontman, Jonathan \"J\" Cridford, to join the band. The \"Reincarnated\" tour continued, but as the tour drew to a close, the decision was made to change the band name, as Paul Gilmartin had lost the legal case against The Danse Society to gain the band name.\n\n\n=== Future ===\nAt the start of 2017, \"The Society\" was born, in order to deliver Paul Gilmartin's legacy of the Danse Society's back catalogue of songs, as well as recording and performing new material. The band self-released a four-track EP, Night Ship in November 2017, to coincide with their tour supporting The Eden House. The mini-gatefold CD sold out its initial run quickly, and was well reviewed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Society discography at Discogs\n\"THE SOCIETY - ft.

    "text": "Dionysos is a French pop band that originated in Valence, Drôme, in 1993; their formation took place at their lycée. The group presents songs in both French and English and has produced six studio albums. They are particularly recognized in France for their surrealism and eccentricity.\nTheir debut album, Happening Songs, was entirely self-produced and featured lyrics exclusively in English. With their subsequent album The sun is blue like eggs in Winter (also self-produced), Babet joined the band. In 1999, they signed a deal with a major label (the now defunct Trema) and released Haïku, which propelled them into the public eye, largely owing to the success of the single \"Coccinelle.\"\nThe name of the band comes from the ancient Greek god Dionysus, which in French is Dionysos.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nThere are evident non-musical influences drawn from Tim Burton and Roald Dahl. Many of the songs carry a surreal quality, with a significant number featuring nonsense lyrics, such as the track \"Surfin Frog.\" The albums Monsters in Love and La mécanique du cœur are situated in a fantastical world teeming with whimsical monsters and other extraordinary characters. This unique setting has been utilized by Mathias Malzieu as the backdrop for two original comic books. The cover art for these comic books, as well as for the two albums, was illustrated by Joann Sfar. Sfar's distinct and comical style of fantasy fiction, as showcased in the Donjon comic books, seamlessly aligns with the band's humor-infused fantasy albums.\nThe lead singer, Mathias Malzieu, is also working on other projects such as the career of Olivia Ruiz (his partner from 2005 to 2011), and his other hobby : writing (published 4 books in 2002, 2005, 2007 and 2011). His second book is based on the same world as the album Monsters in Love, his third book on the same world as the album La mécanique du cœur.  In the same way, there will be connections between his fourth book, Métamorphose en bord du ciel, but not to the same extent as La mécanique du cœur.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMathias Malzieu – vocals, ukulele, folk guitar, theremin, harmonica, glockenspiel\nMathias is the main songwriter and frontman. He has also written three books – 38 mini westerns (Pimientos, 2003), Maintenant qu'il fait tout le temps nuit sur toi (Flammarion, 2005) et La mécanique du cœur (Flammarion, 2007) – with inspiration drawing between the albums and the novels.\n\nÉric Serra Tosio a.k.a. Rico – drums, percussion, whistle\nMichaël Ponton a.k.a. Miky Biky – lead guitar, phonograph turntable, banjo, lapsteel, ukulele, programming\nThe Miky Biky co-produced La mécanique du cœur with Mathias.\n\nGuillaume Garidel a.k.a.

Babet – vocals, violin, keys, banjo, theremin (member since 1998)\nBabet has begun a solo career and released two albums: Drôle d'oiseau (5 March 2007) and Piano Monstre (27 September 2010).\n\nStéphan Bertholio a.k.a.

    "text": "Gas Huffer was an American garage rock band from Washington. They were known for their informal and comical lyrics and their antic-laden stage presence.\n\n\n== History ==\nGas Huffer classified themselves loosely in the garage punk genre. The band created comic books with each album (drawn by all four members of the band, including Joe Newton, now deputy art director for Rolling Stone magazine), that contain the lyrics to the songs. This was done for every album up to (and including) \"Just Beautiful Music\".\nGas Huffer played its final show – dubbed \"The Last Huffer\" – at Seattle's Crocodile Cafe on January 14, 2006. Opening the show were Girl Trouble from Tacoma, Washington, and Canned Hamm [1] from Vancouver, British Columbia. At the conclusion of Girl Trouble's set, K.P. Kendall called Gas Huffer's Tom Price (who has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease) to the stage and presented to him a \"Certificate of Achievement\".\nPrior to Gas Huffer, Tom Price played with The U-Men.\nTom Price and Don Blackstone currently play in the Tom Price Desert Classic. Matt Wright was also briefly a member in the band, having appeared in its debut 7\". The Tom Price Desert Classic LP \"HELL\" was released in September 2014.\nThe term \"huffer\" often refers to a form of substance abuse known as huffing.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Full-length ===\nJanitors of Tomorrow (1991) on Empty Records\nIntegrity, Technology & Service (1992) on Empty Records\nOne Inch Masters (1994) on Epitaph Records\nThe Inhuman Ordeal of Special Agent Gas Huffer (1996) on Epitaph Records\nJust Beautiful Music (1998) on Epitaph Records\nThe Rest of Us (2002) on Estrus Records\nLemonade for Vampires (2005) on Estrus Records\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nBeer Drinkin' Cavemen from Mars (1992) on Empty Records (European release only)\nThe Shrill Beeps of Shrimp (1993) on  Empty Records\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nFirebug (1989) on Black Label Records\nEthyl (1990) on Black Label Records\nMole (1992)  on Sympathy for the Record Industry\nWashtucna Hoe-down (1992) on Hayseed Records\nBeer Drinking Cavemen from Mars/Hotcakes (1992) on Sub Pop\nOoh Ooh Ooh!/Flaming Star (1996) on Lance Rock Records\nRotten Egg/Old Summertime (2000) on Au Go Go Records\n\n\n==== Splits ====\nKing of Hubcaps (1991) split with Fastbacks\nKnife Manual (1992) split with Mudhoney (You Stupid Asshole) on Empty Records (pressed on saw-shaped clear vinyl)\nBad Guy Reaction (1992) Gearhead magazine split with Supercharger\nTeach Me to Kill (1994) split with Red Aunts\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\nHot Cakes (1992)\nCrooked Bird (1994)\nMore of Everything (1994)\nSixty Three Hours (1996)\nSmile No More (1996)\nRotten Egg (1998)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nAnother Damned Seattle Compilation Dashboard Hula Girl Records\nTracks and Fields: Kill Rock Stars Compilation\nRunnin' on Fumes\nPunk-O-Rama Vol. 4: Straight Outta the Pit\nPunk-O-Rama Vol. 3\nAll Punk Rods!\nHype!

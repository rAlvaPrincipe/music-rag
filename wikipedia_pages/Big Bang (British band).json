    "text": "Big Bang are a British electronic music duo formed in 1988 by the founder of Trade nightclub, Laurence Malice, and writer Iain Williams. Based in London, the duo were signed to Swanyard Records and spearheaded the music genre known as big beat.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1988: Formation and early years ===\nBig Bang were formed during the latter part of 1988.\nFrom 1986 to 1988, Malice and Williams were in the band You You You with vocalist Karen O'Connor and backing vocalist Alice Shaw. By late 1986, a new clique of club bands were beginning to make an impression in Europe and Scandinavia that were rediscovering and embracing past dance music and taking it forward onto a different level; Army of Lovers in Sweden and Desireless in France were examples. You You You was part of this renaissance.\n\nYou You You gave their first concert at a secret location in Charing Cross Road, London, in early January 1987. News of the gig remained so secretive that band members have since forgotten where the venue was. The show was arranged as an unannounced warm-up appearance before their debut at Camden Palace on 13 January. The band billed their first series of concerts as 'Stage 1' of their 'World Domination Tour' and enlisted the help of illustrator Mark Wardel to design their publicity. Their appearance at the Camden Palace attracted over 1,000 people on what the Met Office recorded as one of England's coldest nights of the 20th century. \nYou You You built up a strong following performing concerts on the club scene, including three nights at the Hippodrome, London (23 January, 9 February and 6 April), on 19 February at Anarchy Club at London Astoria, at The Fridge, Brixton on 27 March (where they appeared on stage on a huge, white staircase with a troupe of synchronized dancers and were filmed for Japanese TV), at The Zap Club in Brighton on 18 April (as part of the event 'Return of the Django goes to Brighton'), on 28 April at Paradise Lost in Watford,  on 9 May at The Limelight, London, and two shows on 10 July at Paramount City in Soho (formerly the Windmill Theatre),  and on 15 July at Le Palace in Paris (hosted by the performance artist Leigh Bowery.\nThe band received an invitation to appear at The Party – a benefit concert held at Wembley Arena on 1 April to help fund AIDS research and awareness. It was the first such concert held. Many well-known musicians were on the bill, including Elton John, George Michael, Bob Geldof, Meat Loaf, Ben E. King and Kim Wilde. The show was televised globally to over 100 million viewers. Due to the volume of acts performing, You You You were allotted an appearance at the After-Party show held at a London West End theatre where You You You appeared on stage alongside several pop stars, including George Michael, members from the cast of TV's Coronation Street and EastEnders, and performers from several West End musicals, including 42nd Street (musical) and Nunsense.\nOn 2 June 1987, during the run-up to the general election, Karen O'Connor co-starred (as a magician's assistant) in the Conservative Party (UK)'s Election Broadcast, which aired on UK national TV. The 8.44-minute film was part of Saatchi & Saatchi's marketing campaign to help re-elect the Conservative Party. On 12 July, You You You made a guest appearance on the Channel 4 TV show Network 7. The band's new pop video for Head Over Heels, directed by Steven Chivers, premiered on the show, and O'Connor was interviewed inside a caravan by presenter Magenta Devine. On 17 December, You You You gave a special Christmas Show at the Hippodrome, London, their 4th appearance at the venue that year.\nIn February 1988, You You You signed a deal with Orinoco to record a single for Major Productions under the guidance of Orinoco Studios owner Tom Astor. The Lager Brothers – Ken Thomas and Zeke Manyika (from Orange Juice) – produced two tracks with the band. In July, the project halted after O'Connor quit the band to concentrate on her acting career. Soon after the split, Malice and Williams formed Big Bang, using session vocalists for recordings and live performances. The single You You You recorded, How Can This Be Love, was never released.\nPrior to You You You, Malice had hosted the Pyramid Club at Heaven, and Williams had been a solo singer-songwriter and model, as well as a member of the London-based bands Dance on a Telephone and One by One, the latter of which he recorded the 1984 single I Kept My Promise.\nIn January 1984, Williams recorded the dance track Love Is Suicide at Trident Studios in Soho under the provisional title Iain Williams & the 1984 Project. Williams penned the track and co-produced it along with Fiachra Trench. The 9-minute recording based on repetitive chord structures was an experiment in producing a rhythmic, minimalistic dance track aimed explicitly at dance clubs. Musicians on it include Hans Zimmer on Fairlight CMI synth and LinnDrum, guitarist Alan Murphy (later of the band Level 42), lead vocal by Lelo (of Lelo and the Levants), and backing vocals by Shirley and Dee Lewis, with Williams playing the Trident Studio grand piano on which Rick Wakeman played on David Bowie's recording of 'Life On Mars'.\nIn 1985, Williams produced and co-wrote the single The Boys Were There for London-based performance artist Yvette the Conqueror. The record was released on the Fridge nightclub indie label Latex Records.\n\n\n=== 1989: Swanyard Records,Voulez-Vous and big beat ===\n\nBig Bang signed with Swanyard Records at the start of 1989. Margarita Hamilton, the owner of Walton Castle, founded the label. Big Bang was the first band signed to the company. In June 1989, Big Bang released their Arabic-inspired version of ABBA's Voulez-Vous, B-side Cold Nights In Cairo. It reached #101 in the BBC national chart. Big Bang and Steev Toth produced the single. 7\" and 12\" versions (plus a 12\" extended 'Imagine Mix') were released. Lead vocals on Voulez-Vous were shared by Jasmine Duggan Ventura and Teresa Revill, with backing vocals shared by Williams and Malice. Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor plays guitar on the track.  A 12\" white label had previously been released several months earlier. Mixed by Democratic 3, Voulez-Vous (Democratic 3 Mix) reached #1 in several club charts throughout the UK and #27 in the Record Mirror chart. The single charted at #14 in London's (1989) end-of-year club chart.\nIain Williams coined the musical term big beat to describe the band's sound. He explained the concept during an interview with the journalist Alex Gerry in London's Metropolitan magazine under the heading, 'Big Bang in Clubland. Could Big Beat be the 1989 answer to Acid House?'. Big Bang's sound consisted of various experimental musical elements, including heavy hard rock drum beats and synthesizer-generated loops, as well as an added suggestion of European influences that, at times, had a trance-like quality.  Their agent, 10 x Better, released a press release that stated their musical influences included Dalida, Warda Al-Jazairia, ABBA, Tamla Motown, and 70s Euro disco. Big Bang always stated Cold Nights In Cairo gave a better impression of the big beat sound they were aiming for than their recording of Voulez-Vous did. Club DJs picked up on this, and both tracks became club floor-fillers. The concept of the big beat sound was later adapted and became widely used by many musicians throughout the 1990s.\n\n\n=== 1989: Arabic Circus Tour ===\n \n\nIn 1989, Big Bang publicised the release of Voulez-Vous by producing their lavish Arabic Circus Tour. On stage, the band was joined by the vocalists Teresa Revill and Jasmine Ventura and a company of circus acts, including acrobats, one-wheel bicycle riders, fire-eaters, jugglers, flying trapeze artists and a belly-dancing troupe. Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, through her outfits, gave the band and the tour a strong, distinctive image.\nThe Arabic Circus Tour appeared at the Hippodrome in London's Leicester Square, where Visage frontman Steve Strange hosted the night and, it was said, the singer Grace Jones threatened to jump on stage to upstage the band, and at Paramount City in Soho (formerly the Windmill Theatre), at the Hammersmith Palais, and on 18 November at a fetish Ball in ‘a mysterious cavern somewhere on the west side of London’ hosted by the performance artist Leigh Bowery, with experimental musician/vocalist Danielle Dax and American punk singer and former Andy Warhol protégé Jayne County appearing as supporting artists on the bill, and at Heaven nightclub with DJ's Mark Moore (of S'Express) and Colin Faver.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 1990–91: Recording their album & the International Song Festival ===\n1990: Throughout 1990, Big Bang concentrated on writing and recording new material for an album. In October, Malice opened Trade nightclub at Turnmills in London. Trade was Britain’s first licensed all-night after-hours club.\nAlso, in 1990, Malice made a guest appearance in the Dead or Alive video for \"Your Sweetness (Is Your Weakness)\" from \"Fan the Flame (Part 1)\". In the nightclub scenes, Malice appears in drag, playing the cello.\nOn 16 November 1990, Big Bang, accompanied by vocalist Jasmine Ventura, flew to Ireland to represent the UK in the 13th International Song Festival, where they performed their self-penned song One More Chance. It was the first time the song had been heard in public. The festival was held in Cavan over two days and compered by the Irish commentators George Hamilton and Larry Gogan. The Romanian singer Ricky Dandel gave a guest performance. The final took place on 17 November. The Earl Gill Orchestra accompanied Big Bang on stage. Malta won the contest. Big Bang came second in the competition and first for their performance.\nUpon their return to London, Big Bang parted company with Swanyard Records over musical differences. The band immediately secured interest from London Records, who commissioned them to record a single at The Music Station in Fulham, where Big Bang laid down the track One More Chance with a new producer.\n1991: Although Big Bang never officially disbanded, at the tail end of 1991, Malice and Williams decided to concentrate on their careers away from the band. The new material they wrote and recorded for their intended album (tentatively titled \"Theory\") was never released.\n1992: Big Bang's vocalist Teresa Revill, under the name Teresa Revelle, released the single \"Shine\" on Subrosa Records. The House track was written and produced by Leee John and Adam Pense.\n2008: In 2008, one week before Trade closed its doors for the final time, Malice was interviewed on Gaydar Radio by DJ Gary H in a two-hour, two-part documentary about his music career, Trade, and clubbing history—how it all started, the highs and lows, and everything else in between.\n2012: In July 2012, Big Bang released DJ promotional copies of a previously unreleased 12\" rare mix of Voulez Vous.\n\n\n=== 2013: \"I Really Miss U\" ===\nBig Bang - \"I Really Miss U\" (ft. Teresa Revill).\nOn 26 August 2013, Big Bang issued a press statement announcing the release of their first single in over two decades. \"I Really Miss U\" features lead vocals by Teresa Revill. The 'media' dubbed it a 'nu-disco' track.\n\n\n== 2014: \"Arabic Circus // The Dawn Rising\" (EP) ==\nOn 1 July 2014, Big Bang released a new six-track EP. \"Arabic Circus // The Dawn Rising\" is Big Bang's first EP and is a collection of songs/tracks taken from the soundtrack of their \"Arabic Circus Tour\". The EP is 21 minutes in length.\n\n\n=== \"Arabic Circus // The Dawn Rising\" track listing ===\n\n\n=== \"Arabic Circus // The Dawn Rising\" - release history ===\n\"Arabic Circus // The Dawn Rising\" was released on WM Records in various countries worldwide in 2014.\n\n\n=== 2015-present ===\n\n\n== \"Destiny\" by Francon ==\nIn 2015, Williams released the song \"Destiny\" under the alias FRANCON with featured vocals by Keith Pemberton. 'Destiny' is co-written by Williams and Monty Norman and contains the famous four-chord progression from Norman's James Bond Theme. The accompanying video was filmed in Worthing, West Sussex, and uses interior shots in the unique Dome Cinema, Worthing. A JB-007 (Instrumental) mix was also released.\n\n\n=== Alice Shaw ===\nOn 28 July 2016, the media reported that Alice Shaw (former backing vocalist in You You You) committed suicide on 27 July 2016.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Music videos ==\n\n\n== Tours ==\nYou You You – 'Stage I' World Domination Tour (1987)\nBig Bang – Arabic Circus Tour (1989)\n\n\n== Band members timeline ==\nYou You You / Big Bang\nTimeline\n\n\n== Archives and Further reading ==\nBishopsgate Institute - Gordon Rainsford Archive (photographer) - Big Bang performing live on stage at Heaven, London, 20 September 1989, 3 photos refs: 1/2/2/167, 1/2/2/168, 1/2/2/169.\nBishopsgate Institute - Gordon Rainsford Archive (photographer) - Big Bang performing live on stage at Dreamworks at the Hippodrome, London, 11 December 1989, 2 photos refs: 1/2/2/223, 1/2/2/224.\nHoy, Rory.

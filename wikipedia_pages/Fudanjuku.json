    "text": "Fudanjuku (風男塾) is a sub-group of the Japanese idol girl group Nakano Fujo Sisters and was formed in 2007 by Imperial Records. Fudanjuku is Nakano Fujo Sisters' alter-ego boy band, in which the members take on male personas and dress. Fudanjuku released their debut single \"Otokozuka\" in 2008 and later stopped performing as Nakano Fujo Sisters in 2011 to focus on Fudanjuku full-time.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2006, the Nakano Fujoshi Sisters were formed as a comic performance troupe, consisting of gravure models and actresses who considered themselves otaku and fujoshi. In 2010, they renamed themselves Nakano Fujo Sisters and began releasing original music. While performing multiple live shows under the name Nakano Fujo Sisters, the group formed a male-alter ego for themselves, Fudanjuku, to make performances more interesting. The group released their debut single in 2008. \nAfter November 25, 2011, the activities of the group Nakano Fujo Sisters were placed on hiatus. Fudanjuku, however, continues to perform and release new works.\n\n\n== Subgroups ==\n\n\n=== Fudanjuku ===\nFudanjuku (風男塾, formerly 腐男塾 prior to Shijuuin Yousuke's graduation) is an \"alter ego\" male idol group of Nakano Fujo Sisters.\n\n\n=== W Prince ===\nWith the graduation of Seimyouji Uramasa and Akazono Kojiro, the remaining two senior members formed a duo-idol group in 2017 titled W♠PRINCE.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe members use their real names as Nakano Fujo Sisters and their male stage names when performing as Fudanjuku.\n\nAi Hasegawa (長谷川 愛) / Kensui Aiba (愛刃 健水)\nEmi Tanabe (田部 絵美) / Sora Kusakabe (草歌部 宙)\nKiko Sueyoshi (末吉 咲子) / Masaki Kuryu (紅竜 真咲)\nUchida Yuuga (内田夕雅) / Ibuki Miyabi (偉舞喜 雅)\nKomori Nina (小森虹那) / Kanna Touma (神那 橙摩)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nSakura Azuma (東さくら) / Sotaro Oji (桜司 爽太郎)\nAya Kitamuro (北室亜弥) / Katsuki Daiya (香月 大弥)\nRei Fujita (藤田 怜) / Leo Fujimori (藤守 怜生)\nKana Seguchi (瀬口 かな) / Kōki Seto (瀬斗 光黄)\nKanae Shimokariya (下仮屋 カナエ) / Light Kariyase (仮屋世 来音)\nErika Ura (浦 えりか) / Seimyōji Uramasa (青明寺 浦正)\nYūka Konan (虎南 有香) / Kōjirō Akazono (赤園 虎次郎)\nYūka Kyōmoto (京本 有加) / Kyōhei Midorikawa (緑川 狂平)\nMaki Fukumi (福見 真紀) / Ryōma Yukimura (雪村 涼真)\nChiaki Kyan (喜屋武 ちあき) / Momotarō Bukiya (武器屋 桃太郎)\nMariru Harada (原田 まりる) / Renji Ruhara (流原 蓮次)\nYōko Inui (乾 曜子) /  Yōsuke Shijūin (紫集院 曜介)\nHirono Arai (新井 寛乃) / Kanbae Saiki (彩黄 寛兵衛)\nSae Yamamoto (山本 紗衣) / Zan Kisaragi (ザン・黄更城)\nYūko Kimura (木村 裕子)\nAn Nanba (南波 杏)\nAsuka Ruike (類家 明日香)\nAya Kanai (金井 あや)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Concert DVD ===\n\n\n== Other media ==\n\n\n=== Manga ===\nIn 2011, Arina Tanemura, who is friends with the members of Fudanjuku, wrote and illustrated Fudanjuku Monogatari (風男塾物語), a manga adaptation featuring fictional portrayals of their male alter-egos.

    "text": "Phalanx was a jazz quartet featuring guitarist James \"Blood\" Ulmer, drummer Rashied Ali, tenor saxophonist George Adams, and bassist Sirone. They released three albums: Got Something Good for You (1986), Original Phalanx (1987) and In Touch (1988). They've been described as \"an ad-hoc supergroup that thrived and disappeared.\"\nWhile the quartet is said to have moved on after the 1980s, they played a show at the Museum of Natural History in 1991.\n\n\n== References =="

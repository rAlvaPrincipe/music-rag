The single, produced by Vincenzo Callea & Danilo Rispoli, has already topped the DMC (UK) Dance charts in 2006 and has been championed by DJs and clubland across the globe. The track has elements similar to that of Michael Moog's 1999 track \"That Sound.\"\nThe act returned in 2008 with their follow-up, \"Behind,\" which reached number one on Billboard's US Hot Dance Airplay chart in December 2008.

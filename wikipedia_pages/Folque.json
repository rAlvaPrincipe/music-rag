    "text": "Folque is a Norwegian folk rock band founded in 1973 by Morten Bing, Jørn Jensen, Eilif Amundsen, Lisa Helljesen, Espen Løvstad, Trond Øverland, and Trond Villa. In 1972 a subset of the band was initially named «Brød & Vin» (Bread & wine), they changed the name to Folque in the spring of 1973 after adding members and traditional instruments to the ensemble.\nThe band was dissolved in 1984, but reunited in 1994 and in  2004 for playing live. Folque is re-established in 2014 with Lisa Helljesen as lead singer.\nTheir musical style is linked to Malicorne in France and to Steeleye Span in the UK.\nMost of the discography is difficult to find, as only the first three albums were re-released on CD.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nFolque (1974)\nKjempene på Dovrefjell (1975)\nVardøger (1977)\nDans, dans Olav Liljekrans (1978)\nFolques beste (1979)\nFredløs (1980)\nLandet ditt (1981)\nSort messe (1983)\nDans dans (1991)\nStormkast (1998)\n\n\n== See also ==\nFolk och Rackare\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial homepage Archived 2011-07-23 at the Wayback Machine\nMySpace page"

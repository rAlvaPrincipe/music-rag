Their style combines pop and electronic with hints of hip-hop and rock.\nThey represented Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 with their song \"Line\" They also previously attempted to represent the nation in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe group was formed by Agnese Rakovska and her father Aivars Rakovski, with them being joined by Edgars Viļums and eventually also by Kristaps Ērglis. They attempted to represent Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, failing to win the Eirodziesma. In 2011, their song \"Upside Down\" qualified for the final of the preselection, but the band pulled out as Rakovski fell ill. Triana Park's debut studio album, EnterTainment, was released in 2010. A follow-up eponymous extended play was made available for purchase in August 2014, including the lead single \"Iron Blue\".\nThe band attempted to represent Latvia for a sixth time in 2017 with \"Line\" and were successful, receiving 51.56% of the public vote and winning the right to perform for Latvia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2017.

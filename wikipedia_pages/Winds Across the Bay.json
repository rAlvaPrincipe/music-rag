    "text": "Winds Across the Bay (Winds) was a non-profit youth orchestra founded in 1993 in the East Bay Area city of El Cerrito, California, with the philosophy that \"opportunities must be provided to support and encourage youth in the study and love of instrumental music\". It was open to middle and high school students who displayed a high-intermediate to advanced musical proficiency in any wind, brass or percussion instrument, as well as a desire to enhance their ability in the instrumental performing arts.\nWinds featured The Minors, a middle-school ensemble designed for entry-level and intermediate and The Majors, an ensemble for advanced and experienced musicians.\nWinds offered Tuesday evening rehearsals starting in September thru May, with three concerts each year: winter and spring concerts usually held at the Lesher Center for the Performing Arts in Walnut Creek, and summer session concerts at various locations.\nWinds worked with many local schools to augment the musical education which the schools were able to provide, and to afford youth musicians the opportunity to play high-profile performances in their own communities, such as the Lesher Center.\n\n\n== Member schools ==\nMember organizations included:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWinds Across the Bay Youth Orchestra website\nWAB performing Winds of Poseidon in 2013\nParchment Extra Curricular Profile\n2007 Benefit Concert\nWinds Across the Bay | Berkeley Parents Network"

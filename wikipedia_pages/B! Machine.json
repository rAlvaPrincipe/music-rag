    "text": "B! Machine is a synthpop band from San Francisco, California.\nThe band was formed in 1996, consisting of the sole founding member, writer and musician, Nathaniel Leigh Nicoll. The current line-up of the band varies, but typically consists of Nathaniel Nicoll, Mike Hayden, and James Wong. The meaning behind the name B! Machine has been veiled behind cryptic remarks since its inception.\n\n\n== History ==\nNicoll formed Doctors With Knives with Mike Hayden after the singer for a prior band \"left unexpectedly.\" After a number of limited releases, Nicoll released Dorlotez-vous on cassette tape under the name Halflife before forming B! Machine.\n\n\n== 1996–2000 ==\nB! Machine's first project, Must Kill, was recorded in 1996–97. This debut, however, was shelved and left uncirculated until after the release of B! Machine's second full-length project Aftermath, which was distributed by A Different Drum in 1998. Following on the heels of Aftermath, B! Machine signed with A Different Drum. In 1999, they released the full-length CD Infinity Plus which featured production by Jarkko Touhimaa of Neuroactive. Infinity Plus, which spawned the singles \"Temple\" and \"Opal\", was well received, with the album peaking at #25 and the \"Opal\" CD5 peaking at #26 on the CMJ RPM Charts in the U.S.\n\n\n== 2001–2009 ==\nIn the 2000s, B! Machine released three full studio albums: Hybrid, The Evening Bell, and Falling Star. A special 4-disc box set of Falling Star was also released. A collection of alternate versions of previous songs was released as Alternates and Remixes. In addition, a 6-disc anthology of B! Machine songs was released as The Machine Box.\n\n\n== 2021–2022 ==\nIn March 2021, the B! Machine website came back online at a new domain name, announcing a forthcoming full-length album entitled Snake Charm Girl would drop in the spring of 2022. \"Half The Time\", the first digital-only single celebrating the album, was released March 22, 2022 on Bandcamp.  Snake Charm Girl was released digitally on August 5, 2022, through Bandcamp with a limited edition double CD available from Poponaut.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nAftermath (1998)\nInfinity Plus (1999)\nHybrid (2001)\nAlternates And Remixes (2002)\nMachine Box (2002)\nMachine Box (Disc Six - Bonus Disc) (2004)\nThe Evening Bell (2004)\nThe Evening Bell (Limited Edition 4-Disc Set) (2005)\nThe Falling Star (2007)\nSnake Charm Girl (2022)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nTemple (1999)\nOpal (2000)\nOpal (Limited 2 CD Edition) (2000)\nUmbrella (2001)\nAngels (2004)\nForget (2005)\nThe Other Girl (2009)\nA Certain Sadness (February, 2010)\nHalf The Time (2022)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nHouston Press Interview/Tour Review\nB!

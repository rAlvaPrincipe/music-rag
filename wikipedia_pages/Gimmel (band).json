    "text": "Gimmel were a Finnish girl group.\nIn the spring of 2002, a Popstars competition was held in Finland to find members to form a pop band. 454 young women participated in the singing trials. 25 girls made it to the final selection round. Members of the first Popstars band in Finland were Jenni Vartiainen, Susanna Korvala, Ushma Karnani, and Jonna Pirinen. After a few weeks arguments between the girls increased, and Jonna decided to leave the band for a solo career. Ushma, Susanna, and Jenni continued. They decided to adopt the name Gimmel.\nGimmel is the third letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and it also means the number three.

    "text": "The Metronome All-Stars were a collection of jazz musicians assembled for studio recordings by Metronome Magazine, based on its readers' polls. The studio sessions were held in the years 1939–42, 1946–53, and 1956, and typically consisted of two tracks which allowed each participant a chance to solo for one chorus. Earlier recordings feature more swing style, while the later sessions tend more toward bebop.\n\n\n== Participants ==\nAll Star Band 1939: \"Blue Lou\"/\"The Blues\", recorded by Bunny Berigan, Charlie Spivak, Sonny Dunham, Harry James, Tommy Dorsey, Jack Teagarden, Benny Goodman, Hymie Shertzer, Eddie Miller, Art Rollini, Carmen Mastren, Bob Haggart, Bob Zurke, Ray Bauduc.\nThe Metronome All-Stars Nine 1940: \"All-Star Strut\" recorded by Harry James, Jack Teagarden, Benny Goodman, Benny Carter, Eddie Miller, Jess Stacy, Charlie Christian, Bob Haggart, Gene Krupa.\nMetronome All-Stars 1940: \"King Porter Stomp\", recorded by the same personnel as \"All-Star Strut\" plus Charlie Spivak, Jack Jenney, Toots Mondello, Charlie Barnet\nMetronome All-Stars 1941: \"One O'Clock Jump\"/\"Bugle Call Rag\", recorded by Harry James, Ziggy Elman, Cootie Williams, Tommy Dorsey, J.

    "text": "Worlds Apart are an English multinational boy band of the 1990s, with a changing line-up that variously included Marcus Patrick (billed as Patric Osborne) in the original (five-piece) group and, from 1994, Brother Beyond's Nathan Moore. After scoring a few hits in the United Kingdom, the band re-emerged as a four-piece and became chart stars in France. Currently a trio, Steve Hart is its only original and continuous member.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== French singles ===\n\"Everybody\" – Silver (125,000)\n\"Baby Come Back\" – Gold (500,000)\n\"Je te donne\" – Platinum (750,000)\n\"Don't Change\" – Silver\n\"Quand je rêve de toi\" – Gold\n\"Everlasting Love\" – Gold\n\"Je serai là\" – Silver\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nWorlds Apart discography at Discogs"

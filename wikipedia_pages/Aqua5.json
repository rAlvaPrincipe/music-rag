    "text": "Aqua5 (often stylized as AQUA5) was a J-pop group affiliated with the Takarazuka Revue. When the group was formed, all five members were otokoyaku (performers of male roles) in the Revue's Snow Troupe. They made their debut on August 25, 2007, at the opening ceremony of the IAAF World Championships in Osaka, Japan.\nThe group has officially disbanded since April 2010 and their last appearance together was on the show Tokyo Friend Park 2 on 5 April 2010. It was noted on the show itself that it was to be their final appearance as a group. It was also mentioned in the Takarazuka Graph April 2010 issue in an interview with the five member that the article would be AQUA5's last job.\nThe group's name is based on part of Natsuki Mizu's name (水夏希), which translates to \"water\".\nOn June 9, 2009, the group had their first live concert, performing for 1300 fans in Akasaka, Tokyo. However, only four of the members participated, as Kaname Ouki had been recently injured in rehearsals.\n\n\n== Members ==\nNatsuki Mizu (lead)\nMao Ayabuki\nKei Otozuki\nOto Ayana\nKaname Ouki\n\n\n== Discography and releases ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\n\n\n=== Television appearances ===\nNHK Kayo Concert - December 4, 2007\nUtaban - December 12, 2007; December 11, 2008\nTokyo Friend Park 2 - February 23, 2009; April 5, 2010\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial AQUA5 website (Japanese)\nArtist profile on oricon.co.jp (Japanese)\n\n\n== References =="

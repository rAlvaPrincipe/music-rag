    "text": "Jerry Murad's Harmonicats were an American harmonica-based group. \n\n\n== Background ==\nThe earliest iteration of the band was known as the Harmonica Madcaps, which was later renamed The Quintones by Jimmy Mulcay, who was promoting/producting the band up until 1942. The group regularly proformed at the Bijou Vaudeville lounge with Pete Petersen and Jerry Murad on chromatic, AL Fiore on chord, and Bob Hamdick on bass. In 1941, Jerry and AL left the famous Borrah Minevitch rascals, and started a group, quickly to bring on Don Les as a third member, becoming the Harmonicats in 1946. The group consisted of Jerry Murad (chromatic lead harmonica), Bob Hadamik (bass harmonica), Pete Pedersen (chromatic harmonica), and Al Fiore (chord harmonica). In 1947, the group consisted of Murad, Fiore, Don Les on bass harmonica, and Cappy Lafell on Polyphonia. Around 1948 they became a trio, with Murad, Fiore and Les.\nIn 1947, during the record ban, the group recorded the hit song \"Peg o' My Heart\" for Vitacoustic Records, which spent 21 weeks on the Billboard magazine chart (peaking at No. 1) and sold more than two million copies the first year. It was the first record in history to use artificial reverb.\nPedersen and Gail Wallace remained contributors to the group throughout its existence, working on arrangements and occasionally recording.\nDuring 1949, when Don Les' father died, the band asked Johnny Thompson to fill in for Les on bass harmonica for a couple of weeks. Thompson went on to play with them at their residency gig at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas in the early 1950s. In the mid-1950s, Les suffered from a detached retina, and Thompson once again took his place until Les was able to return full time later in the decade. In 1958, Al Fiore suffered his first heart attack and Bob Herndon filled in for him for several months.\nIn the early 1970s, Don Les left the group and was replaced by Dick Gardner, who stayed with the group for more than 20 years. Other members of the group included the following:\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Jerry Murad ===\nJerry Murad (1918–1996) (chromatic harmonica) was an Armenian born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1918, and moved to America at the age of 2.

Murad played Hohner 270s and 64s, as well as the Musette, a harmonica made especially for him that replicates the sound qualities of a French accordion. It is featured on their 1960s recording of \"Parisienne Fantasy\". Murad also played the Hohner Polyphonia (a type of orchestral melodic harmonica). He died of a heart attack in 1996. \n\n\n=== Don Les ===\nDon Les (Dominic Leshinski) (1914–1994) (bass harmonica) was born in Lorain, Ohio, with congenital cataracts.

At one point, he formed his own version of the Harmonicats. The Don Les Harmonicats, which featured Mildred Mulcay (of the harmonica duo the Mulcays) and Lenny Leavitt.

    "text": "The San Francisco Chamber Orchestra (SFCO) is a professional chamber orchestra in San Francisco, California, that presents small orchestra and chamber ensemble performances in the Bay Area.\nThe SFCO was founded by Emanuel Leplin in 1952. It gave its debut concert in April 1953 in Berkeley's Hillel Foundation, in a concert conducted by Leplin. After Leplin was afflicted by polio in 1954, management was taken over by conductors Edgar Braun and Adrian Sunshine. The musicians in the early years were all members of the San Francisco Symphony. Sunshine left in 1958, moving to Europe. Braun served as music director and conductor until 2002, when violist Benjamin Simon was granted the post.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSan Francisco Chamber Orchestra website"

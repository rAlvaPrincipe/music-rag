    "text": "Léon Jean Goossens, CBE, FRCM (12 June 1897 – 13 February 1988) was an English oboist.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGoossens was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, and studied at Liverpool College of Music and the Royal College of Music. His father was violinist and conductor Eugène Goossens, his brother the conductor and composer Eugene Aynsley Goossens and his sisters the harpists Marie and Sidonie Goossens. In 1916 his brother Adolphe, a gifted French horn player, was killed in action at the Somme.\nDuring the early and middle parts of the 20th century, he was considered among the premier oboists in the world. He joined the Queen's Hall Orchestra (conducted by Henry Wood) at the age of 15 and was later (1932) engaged by Sir Thomas Beecham for the newly founded London Philharmonic Orchestra, but he also enjoyed a rich solo and chamber-music career. He became famous for a uniquely pleasing sound few other oboists could match. Oboists of the past had tended to be divided between the French school (elegant but thin and reedy in tone) and the German (full and rounded but rather clumsy, with little or no vibrato), but Goossens brought together the best qualities of both styles.\nGoossens commissioned a number of works for the oboe from such distinguished composers as Sir Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Rutland Boughton and collaborated extensively with other prominent soloists such as Yehudi Menuhin. Amongst his many pupils were the oboists Evelyn Barbirolli, Joy Boughton, daughter of Rutland Boughton and Peter Graeme, oboist of the Melos Ensemble.\nDuring WW2, when Londoners found shelter from German bombs in the Tube, in the underground, Goosens was a reliable entertainer.  He played so often that even a casual concert in Cornwall in 1975 filled the church and people wept, remembering the comfort of his solo playing below ground and into the morning, before the all clear.\nHe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1950 and made a Fellow of the Royal College of Music in 1962.  He married his second wife Lucie Leslie Burrowes in 1933 and there were three daughters: Benedicta, Jennie (an actress) and Corinne.\n\n\n== Works commissioned/dedicated to Léon Goossens ==\nConcerto for Oboe and Strings, Op. 39, Malcolm Arnold\nOboe Quartet, Op. 61 (1957), Malcolm Arnold\nSonatina for Oboe and Piano, Op. 28, Malcolm Arnold\nQuintet for Oboe and Strings, Arnold Bax\nQuintet for Oboe and Strings, Arthur Bliss\nConcerto No. 2 for Oboe and Strings in G, Rutland Boughton\nSonata for Oboe and Piano, York Bowen\nPhantasy Quartet for oboe, violin, viola and cello, Benjamin Britten\nSonata for Oboe and Piano, Arnold Cooke\nThree Pieces for Oboe and Piano, Thomas Dunhill\nSoliloquy for oboe, Edward Elgar\nIdyll for oboe and orchestra (1926), Harry Farjeon\nInterlude, Op. 21, for oboe and string quartet, Gerald Finzi\nConcerto, Op. 45, by his brother Eugene Goossens\nParfums de Nuits, three miniatures for oboe and orchestra (1922), Hyam Greenbaum\nSonata for Oboe and Piano, Herbert Howells\nQuartet for Oboe and Strings, Gordon Jacob\nFrench Suite for Oboe and Piano,  Alan Richardson\nConcerto in A minor for Oboe and Strings, Ralph Vaughan Williams\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFrom Oboe Classics\nInternational Double Reed Society Article\nBritish Double Reed Society"

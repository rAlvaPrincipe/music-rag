    "text": "Small Black is an American indie band from Brooklyn, New York. They are currently signed to the 100% Electronica record label. The band consists of Josh Kolenik (lead vocals/guitar), Ryan Heyner (guitar/keyboards), Juan Pieczanski (bass/guitar), and Jeff Curtin (drums).\nAfter releasing the critically acclaimed Small Black EP, the band signed to Jagjaguwar to release their debut full length, New Chain (2010).\nTheir second full length, Limits of Desire was released in May 2013, with the single \"No Stranger\" a mainstay on satellite radio.\nThe band has toured consistently since 2010, participating in numerous festivals such as Primavera Sound Festival, Fun Fun Fun Fest, Capitol Hill Block Party, and the SXSW Music Festival.\n\n\n== History ==\nJosh Kolenik and Ryan Heyner formed the band while experimenting with lo-fi and loop-based recording techniques. Kolenik cites the Human League, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), David Bowie and Wu-Tang Clan as influences on the group.\nThe initial EP was recorded in Kolenik's uncle's attic with vintage keyboards and samplers, during the winter of 2008-2009 as Uncle Matt made surfboards underneath them.  Guitarist Juan Pieczanski and drummer Jeff Curtin, both from Washington D.C., met while attending Columbia University. The earliest collaborations of the entire group began years prior to the band's formation during after-hours recording sessions in a post-production film studio located in the Brill Building.\nAfter the band's initial release, they supported Washed Out on tour in 2010, also performing with him on stage during that tour.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nTheir sound is commonly described as belonging to the chillwave genre though the band's members don't label themselves as such. The band began with an emphasis on lo-fi sounds and distorted textures in their initial release, but has since adopted a more varied approach, expanding to include a mix of hi and lo-fi sounds, synthetic and acoustic instruments. The underlying elements of synth-heavy production and melodic, lyrical vocal style have been a fixture of the band’s sound throughout their entire catalogue. All the band's releases to date have been self-produced.\n\n\n== Other contributions/collaborations ==\nThe band has provided remixes for Health, Washed Out, and Frankie Rose.\nIn 2010 they released the Moon Killer mixtape, a loose collection of sample-based tracks featuring contributions from  Heems and  Star Slinger.\nJeff Curtin provided the drums for Wild Nothing’s second studio release, Nocturne (2012), and is credited as a sound engineer/producer for his work with Vampire Weekend and Those Darlins.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nNew Chain (Jagjaguwar, 2010)\nLimits Of Desire (Jagjaguwar, 2013)\nBest Blues (Jagjaguwar, 2015)\nCheap Dreams (100% Electronica, 2021)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nSmall Black EP (CassClub/Jagjaguwar, 2009) \nReal People EP (Jagjaguwar, 2014)\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\nMoon Killer Mixtape (Free download, 2011)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nDespicable Dogs EP (Transparent Records, 2009)\nPhotojournalist b/w Sun Was High (So Was I) 7-inch EP (Jagjaguwar, 2010) \n\n\n=== Splits ===\nWashed Out/Small Black split (Lovepump United Records), 2010\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSmall Black website\nSmall Black on the Jagjaguwar official website.\nSmall Black discography at Discogs \nSmall Black at AllMusic\nSean Moeller (April 12, 2011). \"A Warning Of The Ensuing Brightness And The Burn:Small Black session\".

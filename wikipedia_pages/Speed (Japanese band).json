    "text": "Speed (stylized in all caps) was a Japanese female vocal/dance group comprising Hiroko Shimabukuro, Eriko Imai, Takako Uehara and Hitoe Arakaki. All four members are former students of the Okinawa Actors School which also trained popular artists Namie Amuro and MAX.\nSpeed made their major label debut on August 5, 1996, and became an immediate success. They would eventually become the most successful girl group anywhere in Asia with sales of over 20 million singles and albums in just three years and eight months. They disbanded on March 31, 2000, to pursue solo careers and to study.\nFollowing their disbandment, the group reunited several times for charity, but on August 20, 2008, they officially announced plans to reunite permanently. They made their comeback on November 12, 2008, with the single \"Ashita no Sora.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1995–1997: Early success ===\nThe performers who would become Speed met at the Okinawa Actors School and formed a group containing seven to nine rotating members. The group was trimmed down to four when Nippon Television show Yoru mo Hippare (Night of the Hit Parade) requested them to come to Tokyo to perform in December 1995.\nIntroduced as the younger sisters of Namie Amuro, they requested the audience to give the band a name. Rejecting suggestions such as \"The Habus and Mongooses,\" \"Ryukyu Girls\" and \"Okinawa Girls,\" the quartet unanimously decided on \"Speed.\"\nUnlike most artists from the Okinawa Actors School which were signed to the Avex record label, Speed were signed up by Toy's Factory, which the group stated allowed them more creative freedom and expression. Their sole producer during their time together was Hiromasa Ijichi and the members hoped to emulate U.S. R&B group TLC.\nUpon forming, Speed recorded a few songs, however \"Body & Soul\" was chosen to be their debut single. The video for the song was filmed in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and the single sold an impressive total of over 638,000 copies. \"Body & Soul\" was also Speed's longest charting song, lingering in the charts for 31 weeks.\nBody & Soul was quickly followed up by the ballad single \"Steady\" which was their first million-selling single (1.27 million copies). Following Steady, Speed decided to go with a more upbeat song and released \"Go! Go! Heaven\". The video for the song was filmed on location in New York and Miami. The song sold over 665,000 copies and became the group's first single to hit No.1 on Japan's Oricon weekly charts. Following \"Go Go Heaven\", Speed released their debut album Starting Over. The album contained a mix of upbeat songs mixed with soft ballads. Their debut album became their first No.1 album on the Oricon charts. The album's third track, \"Luv Vibration\", has a music video.\nAfter the release of Starting Over, Speed followed on with their upbeat genre and released the single \"Wake Me Up!\". The video for the song was filmed on location in the Philippines and sold approximately 671,000 copies (total shipment: 890,000) when it was released. It was also during this time that Speed decided to have their debut concert. The concert titled 'Speed – First Live' was staged outdoors on location in Odaiba and featured an impressive stage with pyrotechnics and acrobatic stunts.\n\n\n=== 1997–1998: Rise to the top ===\nIn October 1997, they released \"White Love\". Their style saw a change from dance music to a ballad for the single. The Winter-themed single became the smash hit single of that year's holiday period. By the time the single exited the charts it had already sold an impressive 1.845 million copies. After White Love, Speed continued on with their more mature style and released the anthem-like song \"My Graduation\". The single sold 1.475 million copies and became famous as Japan's highest-selling single on the subject of graduation.\nAfter \"My Graduation\", Speed finally released their highly anticipated second album Rise. Rise introduced a change in their musical style and took on a much more futuristic sound compared to their original album. Apparently, the single \"Wake Me Up!\" received a remix just so it could fit in more appropriately with the other tracks on the album. Rise was highly successful, entering the Oricon chart in the top spot and sold over two million copies.\nAfter Rise, Speed decided to give acting a try with the members starring in the Takashi Miike directed Sci-Fi thriller Andromedia. To accompany Andromedia, they recorded a theme track titled \"Alive\". The single was shot in location in Hawaii and became one of Speed's most popular singles. Despite the single's popularity, the song slightly failed to cross the 1 million mark in sales (total 967,000 copies).\nFollowing Andromedia and \"Alive\", Speed began what was to be one of their incredible feats – their Rise Tour. They began their tour first by visiting most of the major cities throughout Japan. All of their concerts immediately sold out. They followed up their Japanese tour with what can only be achieved by the most formidable artists in Japan – the Dome Tour of (Tokyo Dome, Nagoya Dome, Osaka Dome, and Fukuoka Dome). Speed are the only female group in J-Pop to achieve the Dome Tour and had an average age of 15.25 at the time, thus they also hold the record for the youngest performers to complete the feat.\nDuring the Dome tours Speed released another single titled \"All My True Love\", a fast upbeat song shot on location in the Grand Canyon, Arizona. It was considered a turning point for Speed as it contained the first official solo tracks sung by the two members, Hiroko and Eriko. Hiroko's song was titled Mitsumete Itai and Eriko's Tsumetaku Shinaide (under the name, 'Eriko with Crunch', a dance troupe). Both songs also contained their solo music videos shot in Universal Studios, Hollywood. The single was also Speed's first Maxi single to be released on a regular 5\" CD, all previous singles having been released on the fashionable 3\" Mini CD single format. The single topped the charts again and went on to sell over 1.22 million copies.\nAfter the release of \"All My True Love\", Speed followed up by releasing their greatest-hits album: Moment, which topped the charts and shipped over 2.3 million units. Moment contained all of Speed's released singles at that time along with a couple of popular album and single tracks. The album also contained a critically acclaimed Christmas version of the single \"White Love\" and a hidden instrumental track of the song. The first print edition of the album came with flip book showing their trademark dance moves. Three random versions were available – \"Body & Soul\", \"White Love\", and \"My Graduation\".\n\n\n=== 1999: Solo projects ===\nFollowing Moment, Speed released the single \"Precious Time\". The single's video was shot on location in Los Angeles and the single itself also featured a coupling track to celebrate the cartoon character Doraemon's 40th anniversary. The single went on to sell over 623,000 copies.\nShortly after the release of \"Precious Time\", news broke that Takako of the group will be releasing a solo single in March. More surprisingly, the producer will not be Hiromasa Ijichi, but instead Ryuichi Kawamura of Luna Sea. Takako's debut single \"My First Love\" was highly anticipated and came in at number 1, selling over 530,000 copies. The video for the single was shot on location in Hawaii.\nFollowing Takako's solo debut, it was revealed that another Speed member, Hitoe would also be releasing a solo single. For her debut Hitoe decided to go with a much more adult look, appearing in her video wearing mini skirt & bikini with a short coat. The single titled \"Inori\" was more RnB in nature and showcased Hitoe's impressive dance moves. In fact for the single, Hitoe adopted the pseudonym Hitoe's 57 Move (57 meaning Go-Na – gonna in Japanese). Hence Hitoe's 57 Move. The shock value of her image may have worked against her as Hitoe's debut single sold approximately 230,000 copies – nonetheless an impressive figure for a debut single.\nAfter \"Inori\", Speed was back on track again and released another upbeat maxi single, this time titled \"Breakin' Out the Morning\". The single also contained another solo track by Eriko with Crunch titled – \"Everyday, Be With You\". The single sold over 582,000 copies and at the time was actually Speed's worst selling single.  It was also the first single by Speed which was not an original release but a cover.\nFollowing Breakin' Out to the Morning, the time came for Hiroko to show case her solo talents. Her single titled \"As Time Goes By\" was produced by Hiromasa Ijichi and was the theme song of the drama series Tengoku no Kiss. The video for the single was shot on location in New York (mainly Brooklyn). \"As Time Goes By\" was an instant hit, high charting at no. 2 selling close to 900,000 copies.\nAfter Hiro's single, Takako released her second single titled: \"Come Close to Me\". The single was again produced by Ryuichi Kawamura and sold over 200,000 copies.\n\n\n=== 2000: Disbandment ===\nIn October 1999, Speed announced that they would disband. The news shocked many fans and artists alike as they appeared to be breaking up at the peak of their career. The reason offered was that they have grown up and would like to pursue their own solo paths and interests. The date announced for the disbandment was the following year – March 31, 2000. This date was chosen because it was the time when the Sakura would bloom in Japan, thus signaling new life.\nFollowing the news, on November 3, 1999, Speed released their final single titled \"Long Way Home\", which had an R&B vibe to it. The single did not debut at no. 1 on the Oricon charts despite first week sales of over 366,000 copies, due to competition from boy-band Arashi's debut single \"Arashi\" which sold 557,000 copies. Long Way Home eventually sold over 613,000 copies.\nSpeed then released their final album Carry On My Way containing a variety of tracks from soft-tone ballads to R&B songs and even a couple of rock songs. Overall the album sold 880,000 copies. Their summer tour Speed Tour 1999 Real Life visited arenas and halls before a final dome tour, titled Speed Dome Tour 1999 Real Life, took in 6 shows with their very final concert being held in the Fukuoka Dome on Christmas Day.\nA few weeks prior to the disbandment of Speed, hiro release her 2nd single \"Bright Daylight\" and Eriko finally released her own solo CD under the stage name Eriko with Crunch. Eriko's single titled \"Red Beat of My Life\" was a fast-paced song produced by Hiromasa Ijichi with a video filmed in New Mexico, USA. The single debuted at no. 3 and sold over 240,000 copies.\nOn March 29, 2000, Speed released two greatest-hits albums titled Speed the Memorial Best 1335days Dear Friends 1 and Speed the Memorial Best 1335days Dear Friends 2. The albums contained all their hit singles along with previously unreleased tracks and other popular songs from their single b-sides and albums. Dear Friends 2 contained their break-up theme song \"April.\" The albums also contained a program that when installed displayed small virtual images of the members on a computer screen.\nOn 31 March 2000, Speed attended Music Station and performed a final 30-minute mini-live singing a few of their hit songs. The last song they sang together was \"Starting Over\", in which Takako cried during singing.\n\n\n=== 2001–2007: Post break-up and reunions ===\nOn October 6, 2001, Speed held a one-night outdoor live concert at Kobe Awaji for an earthquake charity, attracting more than 24,000 fans. The concert featured past Speed hits, solo songs from individual members and a new single One More Dream.\nSubsequently, One More Dream and a live recording album of the concert Speed Memorial Live \"One More Dream\" + Remix were released on December 12 and December 19 respectively. After being under Toy's Factory record label for 6 years, Speed officially switched to Avex's sub-label, Sonic Groove, at the end of 2001.\nOn December 2, 2001, all Speed members attended the wedding of their long-time producer Hiromasa Ijichi at which they sang Two of Us from their final studio album, Carry On My Way\nOn July 17, 2002, all Speed members attended TV Asahi's Suisupe! together as solo artists.\nOn April 8, 2003, Speed held a press conference in which they announced they would be temporarily reuniting for another charity Save the Children.

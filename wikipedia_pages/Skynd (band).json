    "text": "Skynd (stylised as SKYND) is an industrial rock band consisting of a lead singer named Skynd, and a multi-instrumentalist named Father. Their music applies the grim aesthetic of true crime, with songs largely based on disturbing deaths and murders. They have released songs about topics such as the death of Elisa Lam, the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, and the mass suicide in Jonestown.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSkynd is known for her diverse vocal styles, ranging from high pitch to low pitch and often with an inhuman element. Notably, Jonathan Davis of Korn is a fan and joined Skynd in her song \"Gary Heidnik\". Davis appeared in the music video as well.\nSkynd's first headliner performance was at Electrowerkz in 2019 where she dressed in a motley combination of corpse paint and Victorian-styled clothing. Fans were greeted with cups of Kool-Aid as a reference to her song about the Jonestown massacre. \nShortly after, Skynd was shortlisted as a Heavy Music Awards 2020 Finalist.\nSkynd has been interviewed by The Boo Crew on Episode 90 of the Bloody Disgusting podcast, as well as by Ebony Story of Wall of Sound.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nChapter I (2018)\nChapter II (2019)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Elisa Lam\" (2018)\n\"Gary Heidnik\" (feat.

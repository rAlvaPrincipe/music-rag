In 1997, Manuel Selling was added as a guitar player.  He left in 2000 and Gordon Mocznay took over on guitar and bass guitar. Also in 2000, the band's album Ominous Future was ranked number 15 on the German Alternative Charts (DAC) Top 50 Albums of 2000.\nA year later in 2001, Louis Manke joined the band as well, adding a second guitar to the band.

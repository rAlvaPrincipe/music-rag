    "text": "Dubb Union is a rap group featuring artists from Los Angeles and the nearby areas of Inglewood, Long Beach, and Watts.\nThe original name of the group was Westurn Union, but was later changed to Dubb Union to avoid a lawsuit with banking company Western Union.\nThe members of Dubb Union include Soopafly (Priest Brooks), Damani (Damani Washington), and Bad Lucc (Terence Harden).\nTheir first major label appearance was on the song \"Like This\" from Snoop Dogg's 2006 album Tha Blue Carpet Treatment.\nTheir street album titled House Shoe Muzik, Vol. 1 will be hosted by DJ Crazy Toones and is set to release in April 2008. The production was handled by Soopafly and features the single \"All Night\" as well as \"Cali Grown\". The official Westurn Union album was released on September 8, 2008 through Doggystyle/Koch.\nBad Lucc has started achieving success as a solo artist. He was featured on  German rapper Problem's 2012 single \"Like Whaaat\", which was originally taken from Problem's mixtape Welcome to Mollywood 2, and peaked at #20 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, making both artists' most successful single to date. He has also frequently collaborated with Problem, his group The HBK Gang and their founder Iamsu!.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSnoop Dogg Presents: Dubb Union (2008)\n\n\n=== Appear On ===\n\"I Don't Think So\" from the Untitled Westurn Union project (2007)\n\"Like This\" from Snoop Dogg's Tha Blue Carpet Treatment (2006)\n\"Hat 2 Bac\", \"Killaz\", and \"Rockstar\" from Snoop Dogg presents : The Big Squeeze (2007)\n\"Cali Grown\" from the Untitled Westurn Union Project (2007)\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\nDJ Clue presents Jackin 4 DJ's, Vol.1\nDJ Whoo Kid presents Jackin' 4 DJ's, Vol. 2\nHouse Shoe Musik, Vol. 1\n\n\n=== Member Discography ===\n\n\n==== Damani ====\nAppears on\n\n\"Hate On Me‚Äù\" from Kurupt's Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey (2001)\n\"The Way We Carry On\" from Leroy's Leroy (2001)\n\"Competition\", \"Diva\", and \"I Like Your Style\" from Hair Show Soundtrack (2004)\n\"California Christmas (Remix)\" from Mary Mary's A Mary Mary Christmas (2006)\n\"The Wait Is Over (Remix)\" featuring WC from the CT Experience by DJ Crazy Toones (2006)\nMixtapes\n\nDamani - The Street Album (2002)\nDJ Reflex & DJ Skee Present Damani -  Congratulations Playa (2006)\nDamani -  Adidas Presents Congratulations Player (2009)\n\n\n==== Bad Lucc ====\n\"Watch That Girl\" from My Baby's Daddy Soundtrack (2004)\n\"Have U Ever Seen\" (featuring Scan, 2 a.k.a.

    "text": "Flëur was a Ukrainian musical collective from Odesa. The collective was based around the two original members and frontwomen Olga Pulatova (Ольга Пулатова) and Olena Voinarovska (Олена Войнаровська) who wrote the lyrics, performed vocals and wrote most of the music. Although in later years, the whole collective took part in making music and arrangements, lyrics were still written solely by Olena and Olga.\nFlëur's musical genre is hard to define as it combines many influences. Flëur originated as cooperation of the two singer-songwriters and the music still bears a tiny resemblance to the genre, yet from the very beginning it was in a way different from typical singer-songwriter music. The first official releases also had a touch of neoclassic/ethereal music.\nBecause of the difficulties with picking the right term for Flëur's music, the collective itself created the term \"cardiowave\" (which later gave title to an independent recording label from Odesa which was releasing some of Flëur's sideprojects), but when it comes to more usual terms Flëur usually gets labeled as dream pop.\nThe texts of the label Prikosnovénie spoke of resemblance with Cocteau Twins, All about Eve and Bel Canto.\n\n\n== Band history ==\nFlëur was formed by Olga Pulatova and Olena Voinarovska in Odesa in February 2000. In March 2000 flautist Yuliya Zemlyana joined them. According to an autobiographical story by Olga Pulatova, it was Yuliya who came up with \"Flëur\" as a title for their collective.\nOn 17 March they had their first live concert in Odesa.\nDuring 2000 and 2001 they were joined by Kateryna Serbina (cello), Oleksiy Tkachevsky (drums), Vitaliy Didyk (contrabass) and Oleksiy Dovhaliov(keyboards).\nThe first official release was the CD \"Touch\" (which is English translation of \"Прикосновение\") released on the independent French label Prikosnovénie. Only the album's title was translated to English – all the lyrics and song titles in the CD's booklet are in Russian. One month later the Ukrainian edition of the album came out under the original title \"Прикосновение\". Two more releases followed on the Prikosnovénie label, but these were also the last ones on this label.\nAfter that Flëur was mostly released in CIS countries.\nCurrently Flëur has 8 officially released albums plus reissues of two early releases. The song \"Шелкопряд\" (\"Silkworm\") had the first place in \"Chart Dozen\" hit-parade of Russian radio Nashe Radio — Flëur was awarded the \"Chart crack\" prize as best new band of 2007.\nFrom their inception Flëur's popularity continued slowly but steadily growing. Besides live performances in their hometown of Odesa and Ukraine's Kyiv, the collective also toured extensively in Russia from 2007 to 2012, including many live performances in Moscow which presented them with a full house.\nFlëur has also performed live on radio several times, had a TV slot for the song \"Искупление\" (\"Redemption\") on the Ukrainian music TV-channel M1 (video directed by Yevhen Tymokhin (Євген Тимохін), musical arrangement made by Pavlo Shevchuk (Павло Шевчук) — the producer of Mumiy Troll band).\nTwo more albums were released in the following years: \"The Awakening\" in spring 2012 and \"Storm Warning\" in 2014.\nIn early 2017, the band announced that they would be breaking up after playing three last concerts in May. Following Flëur's dissolution, Pulatova and Voinarovska have continued working on their solo musical careers.\n\n\n== Side projects ==\nMany current and former band members also participated in other musical projects.\n\nОльга Пулатова (Olga Pulatova) was a vocalist on the projects \"Аэроплан\" (\"Airplane\") and \"Оля и Монстр\" (\"Olya and The Monster\") (both defunct now), and cooperated closely with the project \"Dust Heaven\".\nОлена Войнаровська (Olena Voinarovska), Олексій Ткачевський (Oleksiy Tkachevsky), former Flëur member Олексій Довгалєв (Oleksiy Dovhaliev), Катерина Котельникова (Kateryna Kotelnykova) and Анастасія Кузьміна (Anastasiya Kuzmina) took part in the projects \"МРФ\" (\"Мой розовый фашистик\", \"My Little Pink Fascist\") and the English language project \"Amurekimuri\".\nОлексій Довгальов (Oleksiy Dovhaliov) also has his own project \"The Клюквінs\" (\"The Klukwins\", «klukwa» means cranberry in Russian).\nАлла Лужецька (Alla Luzhetska) and Анастасія Кузьміна (Anastasiya Kuzmina) take part in the project \"ТИМ\" (\"Тайный Институт Мозга\", \"Secret Brain Institute\").\nFormer Flёur member Юлія Земляна (Yulia Zemlyana) takes part in the projects \"Аддарая\" (\"Addaraya\") and \"Inversus\".\nЄвгеній Чеботаренко (Yevheniy Chebotarenko) has his own group \"My Personal Murderer\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nОльга Пулатова (Olga Pulatova) — piano, vocals\nОлена Войнаровська (Olena Voinarovska) — guitar, vocals\nОлексій Ткачевський (Oleksiy Tkachevsky) — drums\nКатерина Котельникова (Kateryna Kotelnykova) — keyboards\nАнастасія Кузьміна (Anastasiya Kuzmina) — violin\nЄвгеній Чеботаренко (Yevgeniy Chebotarenko) — bass guitar\n\n\n== Former members ==\nЮлія Земляна (Yulia Zemlyana) — flute\nКатерина Сербіна (Kateryna Serbina) — cello\nОлексій Довгальов (Oleksiy Dovhaliov) — keyboards, acoustic guitar\nВіталій Дідик (Vitaliy Didyk) — contrabass, bass guitar\nОлександра Дідик (Aleksandra Didyk) — cello\nАлла Лужецька (Alla Luzhetska) — flute\nВладислав Міцовський (Vladyslav Mitsovsky) — percussion\nГеоргій Матвіїв (Georgiy Matviyiv) — bandura\n\n\n== Session members ==\nВолодимир Нессі (Volodymyr Nessi) — bass guitar\nАндрій Басов (Andriy Basov) — electric guitar\nAlex Kozmidi — electric guitar, bass guitar\nГеоргій Матвіїв (Georgiy Matviyiv)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums, released in  Russia and Ukraine ===\n2002 — Прикосновение (\"Soft Touch\")\n\n2003 — Волшебство (\"Magic\")\n\n2004 — Сияние (\"Shining\")\n\n2006 — Всё вышло из-под контроля (\"Everything is out of control\")\n\n2008 — Эйфория (\"Euphoria\")\n\n2008 — Почти живой (\"Almost alive\") and Сердце (\"Heart\") — reissue of unofficial releases from the years 2000–2001\n\"Почти живой\"\n\n\"Сердце\"\n\n2010 — Тысяча светлых ангелов (\"Thousands of bright angels\")\n\n2012 — Пробуждение (\"Awakening\")\n\n2014 — Штормовое предупреждение (\"Storm Warning\")\n\n\n=== Albums released in France ===\n2002 – Prikosnovenie (\"Soft Touch\")\nFrench edition of \"Прикосновение\".\n\n2003 – Volshebstvo (\"Magic\")\nFrench edition of \"Волшебство\".\n\n2004 – Siyanie (\"Shine\")\nFrench edition of \"Сияние\".\n\n\n=== Collections ===\n2007 — Флёрография (\"Fleurography\")\n2007 — Трилогия (\"Trilogy\"): \"Прикосновение\"/\"Soft Touch\", \"Волшебство\"/\"Magic\" and \"Сияние\"/\"Shining\"\n2008 – Discography (all albums in MP3)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2007 (December) — Два Облака (\"Two clouds\")\n\n\n=== Unofficial releases ===\n2000 (July) — Почти живой (\"Almost alive\")\n2001 (January) — Сердце (\"Heart\")\n2001 (November) — Special Edition\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n\n\n== References =="

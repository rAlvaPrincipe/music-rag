The two met in 2014 at a pop music writing session before coming together to form a musical duo.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nProducer and collaborator Mark-Anthony Tieku (AKA \"Tieks\") introduced Burnett and Blay during a pop songwriting session in 2014.\nTieks had worked with both Burnett on Sparkadia's album The Great Impression  and with Blay on an unreleased CocknBullKid album.\nBurnett and Blay joined forces to form the Antony & Cleopatra duo.

The official music video was co-directed by Burnett and Blay with Andrew Bird.\nOn social media, the duo said of the track and the minimalist video: \"The bigger the city, the lonelier you'll feel within it... You can't escape the sounds of sirens in London and the constant reminder of how lucky we are not to be the sirens' endpoint... In this modern era of frenetic videos, we wanted to make a video that moves you through simple emotion rather than explosions and dudes backflipping.\"\n\nLater in 2015 they released the single 'Take Me'. They spoke to The 405 about the track, noting that it: 'draws heavily on the traditions of UK dance music, and this track is at its heart a shout out to all of their favourite elements. Diva vocals, breakbeats and dark textures combine...'\nThe official video features a montage of notable couples through history.

    "text": "Einherjer is a Viking metal band from Haugesund, Norway, founded in 1993. Some of the band's albums are heavily folk influenced, while others have a more traditional symphonic black metal sound. Their lyrics retell Norse legends, and each of their albums has its own theme. The band split up in early 2004 after releasing the album Blot in December 2003, but later reformed.\nIn December 2004, all members of Einherjer's last lineup, including the band's founders Frode Glesnes and Gerhard Storesund, founded the thrash metal band Battered together with bass guitarist Ole Moldesæther.\nIn September 2008, Einherjer announced that they would reunite to do some selected shows across Europe in 2009, including the Ragnarök, Kaltenbach and Wacken festivals. The band signed with Indie Recordings in December 2010; their first album in eight years, Norrøn was released in September 2011. Einherjer has since released three more studio albums, and the latest one, North Star, was released on February 26, 2021.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe band's name is taken from Norse mythology, where the term Einherjar describes the slain warriors who have gone to Valhalla and joined Odin's table.\n\n\n== Battered ==\nThe band was reconstituted in 2004 as \"Battered\", a thrash band that included Glesnes, Storesund, and Herløe.  A new vocalist joined them in 2005, Siggy Olaisen, The band only released one demo, ...Beyond Recognition, and one album—also named Battered—before disbanding.

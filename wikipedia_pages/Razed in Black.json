    "text": "Razed in Black is an electronic music act created by Romell Regulacion (vocals, keyboards, guitars) and was supported in live performances by band members Chris Nelson and Raj Kapololu. The band was formed in Hawaii in 1994 and signed to Cleopatra Records in the following year, before later moving to Jacksonville, Florida. Razed in Black's music combines elements of industrial, synthpop, dark wave, gothic rock, and hardcore techno.\nMostly an underground act, Razed in Black have had songs featured on television shows like Homicide: Life on the Street, in movies, and in videogames.\nRegulacion has also released material under the names DJ R<I>B, DJ Skooby, and Transmutator. Transmutator incorporates more techno and hard electro/beat elements in its musical style, while Razed in Black has more lyrically-based songs with a darker tone and a heavier pop/rock influence.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nShrieks, Laments, and Anguished Cries (1996)\nOverflow  (1997)\nFunky Disco EP (1997) (as Transmutator)\nTake Over (1997) (as Transmutator)\nThe Colony of Sluts (1999) (as Transmutator)\nSacrificed (1999) – #24 CMJ RPM Charts\nOh My Goth!

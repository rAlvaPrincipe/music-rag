    "text": "The Ophelias are an American rock band from Cincinnati, Ohio. The group first met at a time when each were independently serving as the \"token girl\" in various male-fronted bands from their hometown. \"Coming from varied musical backgrounds (ranging from garage-rock, to surf, to opera), the distinct talents and influences of each member collided in unexpected ways at the band's first rehearsal. It was here the band discovered that their chemistry wasn't rooted in a shared musical reference point, but in the creative relief from the expected censorship of being a side person.\"\nIn 2015, Yoni Wolf of Why? saw the band playing at a Fourth of July festival in Cincinnati. \"There they were— The Ophelias: four teenage girls up on a temporary stage, playing, what to me at the time, sounded like a mix between Velvet Underground, underground British psych-noise-folk-rock from the late ‘90s / early 2000s (think Hood, Movietone, Crescent), and some kind of softer side of punk...\"\nWolf submitted their debut LP, Creature Native, to Joyful Noise Recordings' White Label Series, and it made the cut. Creature Native became the first entry released through the series. In the summer of 2018, The Ophelias went on tour with the Low Anthem. The group's second full-length album, Almost (produced by Yoni Wolf), followed in July 2018; with its first single \"Fog\", premiering at Stereogum and the video for \"Lunar Rover\" premiering at New Noise Magazine.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nCreature Native (2015)\nAlmost (2018)\nCrocus (2021)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nFor Luck (2020)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nMermaid-Like - Low/These Days (2015)\nNight Signs (2017)\nFog (2018)\nGeneral Electric (2018)\nLunar Rover (2018)\nGrand Canyon (2020)\nLast Christmas (2020)\nNeil Young on High (featuring Julien Baker) (2021)\nSacrificial Lamb (2021)\nVapor (2021)\nTwilight Zone (2021)\nSilver and Gold (2021)\n\n\n== References =="

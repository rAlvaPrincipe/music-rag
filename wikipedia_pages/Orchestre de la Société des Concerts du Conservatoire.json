    "text": "The Orchestre de la Société des concerts du Conservatoire (French pronunciation: [ɔʁkɛstʁ də la sɔsjete de kɔ̃sɛʁ dy kɔ̃sɛʁvatwaʁ]) was a symphony orchestra established in Paris in 1828. It gave its first concert on 9 March 1828 with music by Beethoven, Rossini, Meifreid, Rode and Cherubini.\nAdministered by the philharmonic association of the Conservatoire de Paris, the orchestra consisted of professors of the Conservatoire and their pupils. It was formed by François-Antoine Habeneck in pioneering fashion, aiming to present Beethoven's symphonies, but over time it became more conservative in its programming.\nIts long existence kept the tradition of playing taught at the Conservatoire prominent in French musical life. The orchestra occupied the center-stage of French musical life throughout the 19th and most of the 20th centuries. A major tour of the US took place in 1918, appearing in 52 cities. Later that year it made the first of its many recordings.\nIn 1967, financial difficulties, along with irregular work for the players and poor pay led to a decision by the French government to form a new orchestra. Following auditions chaired by Charles Munch, 108 musicians were chosen (of whom 50 were from the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra) for the newly created Orchestre de Paris, which gave its first concert on 14 November 1967 at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées.\nThe chief conductors of the orchestra were:\n\nFrançois-Antoine Habeneck 1828–1848\nNarcisse Girard 1848–1860\nThéophile Tilmant 1860–1863\nFrançois George-Hainl 1863–1872\nÉdouard Deldevez 1872–1885\nJules Garcin 1885–1892\nPaul Taffanel 1892–1901\nGeorges Marty 1901–1908\nAndré Messager 1908–1919\nPhilippe Gaubert 1919–1938\nCharles Munch 1938–1946\nAndré Cluytens 1946–1960\nNo principal conductor was appointed during the orchestra's final years 1960–1967.\nNotable premieres given by the orchestra include Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique, Saint-Saëns's Cello Concerto No. 1, and Franck's Symphony in D minor.\nThe Paris Conservatoire Orchestra also made the first recording of Debussy's La mer with conductor Piero Coppola in 1928.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOnline version of extracts and appendices to D.

    "text": "Rigoberta Bandini is a Spanish musical act as well as the stage name of its frontwoman, singer-songwriter Paula Ribó. Other members of the band are Ribó's partner, Esteban Navarro, and cousins, Joan Barenys and Belén Barenys (Memé), who variously provide instrumentation and vocals. Ribó and Memé sing; Barenys is a multi-instrumentalist; and Navarro plays keyboard and produces with Ribó. The act has won two Premios Odeón and a Goya, among other accolades.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2019, Paula Ribó, who had been a member of the Mamzelles in the 2010s and dubbed many musicals into Spanish and Catalan, launched her solo music career under the stage name of Rigoberta Bandini. The name combines those of human rights activist Rigoberta Menchú and the John Fante character Arturo Bandini.\nRibó began releasing music as Rigoberta Bandini in 2020, which she, Navarro, and the Barenys siblings had recorded. That year, Rigoberta Bandini (still principally identified as Ribó as a solo act) rose to prominence in Spain when the singles \"Too Many Drugs\" and \"In Spain We Call It Soledad\" went viral. The group began performing together in 2021. The first live performance as a group was a selection of their songs recorded for a live-at-home concert from the Thyssen Museum in December 2020, after which they began touring. They found further success with the song \"Ay mamá\", with which they competed in the inaugural Benidorm Fest.\n\n\n== Style ==\nThe music of Rigoberta Bandini draws on many feminist influences, heard overtly in \"Perra\" and \"Ay mamá\". Ribó has said that, in her songwriting, she enjoys lyrics that have humour and entertain her.\nClash described a live set by the group as \"high-energy chaos\", noting that the music drew on genres including flamenco, synth-pop, and rap. Eurovision Song Contest music website Wiwibloggs described the group's musical style as a fusion of harmonic choral elements and electropop. Hot Press compared the group's sound to Pet Shop Boys, Peaches, Celine Dion and Pussy Riot.\nIn terms of live performance, Clash noted that the music is elevated by the energy of the group. It praised their ability to all be dancing energetically and at the same time \"maintain their ABBA-like harmonies\". La Vanguardia compared the performance style to having a party on stage; Time Out Barcelona described the Rigoberta Bandini performance at Primavera Sound 2022 as a variety show or a party, as space was given for Navarro to add some stand-up comedy and for Memé to take more of a spotlight. Iconic to their concerts, Ribó would characteristically wear her old school uniform from the Col·legi de les Teresianes, with Memé in a similar outfit and Navarro and Barenys dressed as \"computer nerd cool\".\nThe cover art of Rigoberta Bandini singles always features a box frame with the name of the song and the artist repeated around it.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPaula Ribó González – an actress and singer, Ribó is the frontwoman of the group who is also individually known as Rigoberta Bandini. She is the lead vocalist and writes, composes, and produces the songs.\nEsteban Navarro Dordal – a comic actor known for Venga Monjas and Ribó's partner, Navarro also writes, composes, and produces, and plays the keyboard and synthesiser.\nBelén Barenys González (Mari Belén Barenys González, also known by the stage name Memé) – also an actress and singer, and Ribó's cousin, Memé has previously worked with Ribó in dubbing, including voicing the young Merida across from Ribó as the main version in the Catalan version of Brave. She provides background vocals, and occasionally lead vocals alongside Ribó.\nJoan Barenys González – an actor and musician, Memé's brother and Ribó's cousin, he has dubbed films with both women, including the Catalan version of Up with Memé and the Castilian version of Hotel for Dogs with Ribó. He is a multi-instrumentalist; originally a pianist, in Rigoberta Bandini performances Navarro takes the keys and Barenys provides percussion and guitar.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\"Se va\" (2021) (with Delaporte)\n\"Amanecer\" (2021) (with Alizzz)\n\"Splash (màs que mares)\" (2024) (with Colapesce and Dimartino)\n\"Contradicción\" (2024) (with Love of Lesbian)\n\n\n==== Promotional singles ====\n\"Fiesta\" (2020)\n\"Cuando tú nazcas\" (2020)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References =="

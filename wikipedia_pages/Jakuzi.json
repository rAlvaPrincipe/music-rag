Kutay Soyocak and Taner Yücel formed the project to move away from their previous punk-oriented music projects. The duo rose to prominence in Istanbul's underground music scene after the release of their debut album Fantezi Müzik. Originally released in 2016 through Domuz Records, it was reissued by City Slang on 24 March 2017.\nThe band's sound has been described as synthpop, dark wave and new wave.

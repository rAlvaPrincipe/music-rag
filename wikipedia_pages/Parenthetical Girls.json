    "text": "Parenthetical Girls was an experimental pop band formed in Everett, Washington in 2002, and disbanded in 2013.\n\n\n== History ==\nBegun by lead singer Zac Pennington, the band originally known as Swastika Girls in 2003. \nPennington released (((GRRRLS))), the band's vinyl-only debut album on his own Slender Means Society label in 2004. Recorded with the help of Jherek Bischoff and Jamie Stewart (the latter of Xiu Xiu), (((GRRRLS))) featured different mixes of the seven songs on each side of the record.\nBeginning in 2010, the band released a series of limited 12\" EPs which would later be compiled into their 2013 album Privilege. The records were sold through Pennington's Slender Means Society label directly to fans, rather than distributed to record stores. At the end of the cycle, the fifth record came packaged with a box to house all the releases. The release was notable as each record was hand-numbered in the blood of the band number featured on the cover.\n\n\n== Breakup ==\nOn June 19, 2017, Pennington announced his new project, Comedienne, which includes Deerhoof's Greg Saunier and longtime collaborator Jherek Bischoff. The announcement came alongside news that Parenthetical Girls is officially defunct.\nAs of 2019, Pennington is engaged in a project, entitled Popular Music, alongside Prudence Rees-Lee. They released their first album, a collection of covers from pop culture called Popular Music Plays in Darkness, on November 20, 2020. Their second album, Minor Works, was released on October 13, 2023.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2004 (((GRRRLS)))\n2006 Safe as Houses\n2008 Entanglements\n2013 Privilege (Abridged)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n2004 Christmas with Parenthetical Girls EP\n2006 Twenty Bees 7\"\n2006 A Parenthetical Girls Family Christmas EP\n2007 Parenthetical Girls/The Dead Science split 7-inch|Parenthetical Girls/Dead Science 7\" split\n2007 Addendum (Safe as Houses European bonus EP)\n2008 A David Horvitz Picture Disc with Parenthetical Girls\n2008 A Song for Ellie Greenwich\n2009 The Scottish Play: Wherein the Group Parenthetical Girls Pay Well-intentioned (If Occasionally Misguided) Tribute to the Works of Ivor Cutler (Mini-Album)\n2009 Morrissey/The Smiths 7\" split (with Xiu Xiu)\n2009 \"The Christmas Creep\"\n2010 Tomlab Alphabet Singles Series Z\n2010 Privilege, Pt.

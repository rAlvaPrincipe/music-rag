    "text": "The KBS Symphony Orchestra (KBS 교향악단) is a symphony orchestra based in South Korea. The orchestra principally performs in the KBS Hall and the concert hall of the Seoul Arts Center. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe orchestra was founded in 1956 as the radio orchestra of the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS). Between 1969 and 1981, it became a state-run organization, changing its name to the National Symphony Orchestra of Korea. In this period, they performed chiefly in the National Theater of Korea. In 1979, they made their first tour overseas, in the USA.\nFrom 1981, the orchestra's designation was restored to its former name, and new positions, such as general manager, principal guest conductor and full-time conductor, were established in the organization. Their subsequent overseas tours were in Southeast Asia (1984) and Japan (1985 and 1991). In October 1995, they performed in the UN General Assembly in New York City.\nIn 2000 and 2002, the orchestra performed with the State Symphony Orchestra of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Seoul and Pyongyang. The orchestra also held \"goodwill exchange concerts\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra and the China National Symphony Orchestra in 2002.\nYoel Levi was music director of the orchestra from 2014 to 2019. In May 2021, the orchestra announced the appointment of Pietari Inkinen as its next chief conductor and music director, effective January 2022, with an initial contract through the end of 2024.\n\n\n== Titled conductors ==\nChief conductors\n\nIm Won-sik (1956–1971)\nYeon-Taek Hong (1971–1981)\nGyeong-Su Won (1986–1988)\nOthmar Mága (1992–1996)\nMyung-Whun Chung (1998)\nDmitri Kitayenko (1999–2004)\nShinik Hahm (2010–2012)\nYoel Levi (2014–2019)\nPietari Inkinen (2022–present)\nPrincipal guest conductors\n\nWalter Gilesen (1982–1984)\nMoshe Atzmon (1990–1992)\nVakhtang Jordania (1990–1996)\nEun-Seong Park (2000–2002)\nSeung Gwak (2004–2006)\nFull-time conductor\n\nNan-Sae Geum (1981–1992)\nConductor Emeritus\n\nIm Won-sik (1998–2002)\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nIn 1995, the KBS Symphony Orchestra recorded Alan Hovhaness' Symphonies Nos. 39 and 46 with guitarist Michael Long and conductor Vakhtang Jordania with KOCH International Classics.

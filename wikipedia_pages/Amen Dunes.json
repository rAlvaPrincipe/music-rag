    "text": "Amen Dunes is the musical project formed by American singer-songwriter and musician Damon McMahon in 2006.\n\n\n== History ==\nDamon McMahon founded the band Amen Dunes in 2006 in New York, New York.\nAmen Dunes' fifth record, Freedom, has received positive reviews, with Pitchfork calling it McMahon's \"euphoric breakthrough\". In addition to his regular collaborators Parker Kindred and Jordi Wheeler,  Freedom features Delicate Steve and underground Roman musician Panoram. Chris Coady  (Beach House) produced. The record was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City and Sunset Sound in Los Angeles.\nWith his forthcoming album Death Jokes, the spiritual reflections and meditations of Amen Dunes are turned away from himself, and out sharply towards the world. The album is also a drastic turn musically and thematically , rooted in the electronic music of raves and of rap music he grew up with but never imagined himself able to make, playing like a scathing electronic essay on America's culture of violence, dominance, and destructive individualism. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n2009: D.I.A.

    "text": "MOONBOOTICA is the pseudonym of Hamburg DJs KoweSix (Oliver Kowalski) and Tobitob (Tobias Schmidt), who have been playing together since the 1990s.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe MOONBOOTICA music project was born at the early Moonbootica party series in the clubs of Hamburg. Their style can be categorized as electronic music, drawing on electro and house genres, with certain hip-hop influences. The pair founded the Moonbootique label, releasing their own productions on the imprint.\nTheir eponymous debut album Moonbootica was released in 2005. It included the single \"June\" which was very well received in the electronic music scene. In 2007, the album Moonlight Welfare featured Der Mond - a collaboration with Hamburg compatriate Jan Delay. In 2011, Moonbootica released the track \"Tonight\" on the influential UK label Cheap Thrills. A third studio album was released in 2012; Our Disco Is Louder Than Yours was issued by Berlin label Four Music. Amongst the guests to feature here were Reggie Noble and Bon Homme from the Danish band WhoMadeWho. Shine, their fourth album, followed in June 2014, entering the top 50 of the German charts. Two singles from the album, \"These Days Are Gone\" and \"Beats & Lines\", were presented in a split video shot in Los Angeles and directed by Skinny. This is the second time that Moonbootica have worked together with the director duo hailing from France. Their previous collaborative effort, \"ICONIC\", was shown at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMoonbootica have worked on remixes for a variety of artists including Robbie Williams, Skunk Anansie, Beatsteaks, Faithless, Jan Delay, Hurts and Kruder & Dorfmeister. Their own releases have also featured illustrious guests such as Anthony Mills, Thomas Hofding, Thomas Azier, Mohini Geisweiler, Siri Svegler and US rapper Reggie Noble. The duo have played DJ sets in clubs all over Europe on a regular basis (e.g. Watergate, Berlin / Razzmatazz, Barcelona / Krysha Mira, Moscow) and events in Australia and South America.\nMoonbootica began playing an hour-long live show in 2013 which they have performed at renowned festivals like Rock am Ring/Rock im Park, Sputnik Springbreak and SonneMondSterne. For the live show, they created their very own lighting installation, weighing in at 1.5 tonnes. Guest vocalists and their own vocal performances extended the artistic spectrum far beyond the classic DJ show into a fully fledged live act. Since 2009, KoweSix has also worked with Kris Menace on the Black Van project, released by the New York label DFA.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\"I'm on Vacation\" was featured in the Fox animated series Duncanville episode \"Judge Annie\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nMoonbootica (10/2005)\nMoonlight Welfare (10/2007)\nOur Disco Is Louder Than Yours (05/2012)\nShine (06/2014)\nFuture (04/2018)\n\n\n=== Mix compilations ===\nDJ sounds good (03/2004)\n... and then we started to dance (10/2006)\nMoonbootique Records Present Sound (2007)\nSave The Night (10/2009)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nMoonbootation (06/2001)\nGet it on (04/2002)\nMau Mau high (01/2003)\nWe 1,2 Rock / Roll the Dice (01/2004)\nBulldog beats (07/2004)\nJune / Mustang (02/2005)\nListen (08/2005)\nPretty little angel (12/2005)\nMopedgang (04/2006)\nWattbird / Break of light (10/2006)\nJump Around (09/2007)\nDer Mond feat.

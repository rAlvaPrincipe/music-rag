He had previously distinguished himself on two occasions, on 22 and 24 October by bringing up ammunition under heavy shell and rifle fire. Again, on 3 November, he brought into cover some wounded men who were lying, exposed to enemy fire, in the open.\nBent was a Freemason and was initiated into Aldershot Camp Lodge No. 1331 on 8 December 1920.\nHe later achieved the rank of Company Sergeant-Major. He survived the war and died on 3 May 1977. Bent was cremated at West Norwood Cemetery, London.\nBent's VC, along with his Military Medal and Russian Cross of St. George was sold at auction in June 2000 for £80,000. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDrummer Spencer John Bent, VC (Henry L. Kirby, R.R.

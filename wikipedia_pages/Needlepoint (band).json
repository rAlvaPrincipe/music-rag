The band started out as a trio with Bjørn Klakegg, Nikolai Hængsle and Thomas Strønen in 2010 releasing the album The Woods Are Not What They Seem (2010).

He was replaced with Ola Øverbye, known from Fieh, in 2024. The latest album Walking up That Valley was released in 2021. They operate in a soundscape somewhere between psychedelic 1970's rock and jazz-rock.\nNeedlepoint have played at several festivals in Norway, at different clubs, and has also been touring in China. In November 2013 they played in Paris, and appeared at 2016 Nattjazz in Bergen, Norway.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nBjørn Klakegg - guitar, vocals\nDavid Wallumrød - keyboards (2012–present)\nNikolai Hængsle - bass\nOla Øverby - drums (2023–present)\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nOlaf Olsen - drums (2014–2023)\nErlend Slettevoll - keyboards, stand-in at gigs (2021)\nTorjus Vierli - keyboards, stand-in at gigs (2020)\nThomas Strønen - drums (2010-2012)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2010: The Woods Are Not What They Seem (BJK Music)\n2012: Outside The Screen (BJK Music)\n2015: Aimless Mary (BJK Music)\n2018: The Diary of Robert Reverie (BJK Music)\n2021: Walking up That Valley (BJK Music)\n2024: Remnants Of Light (BJK Music)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAimless Mary at YouTube"

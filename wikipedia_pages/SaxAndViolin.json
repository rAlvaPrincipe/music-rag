Bennett grew up listening to his father's film scores in his studio and was introduced to the saxophone through his father at age 11. In addition to being one of Canada's most recognized saxophonists, Bennett has performed twice at the GRAMMY Awards in Los Angeles, shared the stage with the likes of Oscar Peterson and the Neville Brothers, opened for the legendary pianist Herbie Hancock, and had one of the top jazz albums in Canada with his WCMA nominated “Jazz Album of the Year” debut, Breakthrough. Rosemary Siemens was born and raised in Plum Coulee, Manitoba, Canada, and took up the violin and piano at three-years-old through playing hymns with her mom, Mary Siemens. Siemens has performed four times at New York's Carnegie Hall and was the first violinist to ever perform at the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican since its inception in 1483. Rosemary has performed in over 25 countries, 40 U.S. States, for two U.S. Presidents and Canadian Prime Ministers, and recently won “Country/Gospel Album of the Year“ at Canada's Gospel Music Awards. Her album \"Plum Coulee, My Home\" won Best Bluegrass/Country Album at the Global Music Awards in 2016. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn March, 2017, Siemens was on her \"Have a Little Faith\" Canadian tour and was performing at Buhler Hall in Gretna, Manitoba, when her boyfriend, saxophonist Eli Bennett, who was also on his own Canadian tour, entered through the back of hall playing Elvis's \"Can't Help Falling In Love\" on his saxophone. Once on stage, Bennett got down on one knee, pulled a ring out of the bell of his saxophone and proposed to Siemens in front of the entire audience. She said yes, and the couple were wed later that year on August 20, 2017, in a public wedding ceremony in Plum Coulee, Manitoba. The ceremony was attended by 1,500 and live streamed by over 50,000 people via Facebook live. In September 2018, after performing 175 concerts in 100 cities in the nine months of their secret pregnancy, the couple welcomed their first son, Theodore Parker Bennett into the world. They announced the birth through a YouTube music video featuring a song Siemens wrote and Bennett produced entitled \"You and Me\". In 2020, Siemens won a Covenant Award for Children's Song of the Year for that same song, which is also featured on their debut album Can't Help Falling In Love (Instrumental Love Songs), Vol. 1. \n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n2020 Covenant Award for Instrumental Song of the Year (You Say, winner)\n2020 Covenant Award for Children's Song of the Year (Rosemary Siemens feat.

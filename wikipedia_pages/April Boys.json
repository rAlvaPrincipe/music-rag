April Boys which contains the Tagalog/English cover version of the song いとしのエリー(\"Itoshi no Ellie\"), renamed \"Honey My Love So Sweet\".\nIn 2002, after departure of Vicor Music the duo released the same title and self-album Labs Kita under Prime Music Corporation (is a wholly owned subsidiaries of VIVA Entertainment) after one-year recording contract.

    "text": "Banaroo was a German pop group active from 2005 to 2008 and then 2013 with a new line up. They had several successful singles in countries including Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\nThe first line-up consisted of Robbert \"Bobby\" Dessauvagie, Vittorio \"Vito\" Magro, Stefanie \"Steffy\" Dreyer and Kathrin \"Cat\" Geißler and were active from 2005 until they disbanded in 2008. In 2013, the group was relaunched with new members Doro Farkas, Laura Luppino, Alvin Philipps and Daniel Langer. The second line-up disbanded on November 6, 2013.\n\n\n== History ==\nBanaroo: The Star Diary\nFollowing the continued success of casting shows on German television, Super RTL designed the Star Diary as a new television format. The spiritual father of the project is Michael Bolte, member of the marketing department of Super RTL. Based on the concept of pop stars, the new program was to accompany a newly assembled pop band documentary during their first career steps and thus provide an authentic view of the initial work of a band. In contrast to other formats, however, all interactive elements for the continuous selection of the casting participants were dispensed with.\nThe casting took place before the beginning of filming in close cooperation with the record company Na Klar! Records Hennef / Berlin. So-called high potentials were to be found, young artists who were still at the beginning of their careers, but who were already able to refer their first experiences to audiences in the field of song and dance. From the casting Dessauvagie, Dreyer, Geissler and Magro emerged as participants in the series. Banaroo was chosen as the name of the band. According to Vittorio Magro, he goes back to his own experience during a visit to the zoo. When a small child asked him if kangaroos also eat bananas, he replied, \"If kangaroos were to eat bananas, they would have to be called banaroos ...\"\nWith the broadcast of Banaroo: The Star Diary began Super RTL on April 18, 2005. By July 10, 2005, at 10:05 pm, a total of 84 chapters were shown daily. The series was produced by Mark Feuerstake, who also directed. For the filming, the four band members moved into a shared flat in Cologne . In the five-minute episodes, viewers were able to follow all of Banaroo's career-building activities, such as voice training and choreography, but also gained private insights. Each Saturday morning, Super RTL broadcast a 20-minute week summary.\nThe program has become the most successful own production of Super RTL since the existence of the transmitter. Every evening, an average of 590,000 viewers (market share: 2.9%) followed the series, in the peak even up to 800,000 spectators. In the target group of 3- to 13-year-olds, which is relevant to Super RTL, The Star Diary had on average 370,000 viewers and a market share of 30.2&.\n\n\n== 2005 ==\n\n\n=== Debut single & Banaroo's World ===\nFive weeks after the first episode came on May 23, 2005, the debut single Dubi Dam Dam on the market. In addition to a remix, also included the title song of the series: Make You See the Stars. The single was produced by Carsten Wegener and Timo Hohnholz, who were also responsible for essential parts of the following albums. And as with other cast bands before, the strategy at Banaroo was to use constantly available television presence as a marketing tool. The song immediately reached second place in Germany in the singles charts. He was similarly successful in Austria and Switzerland.\nThe debut album Banaroo's World released five weeks later on 20, June 2005, was also a great sales success. it debuted 5th and rose to number 1 in August 2005. In Austria, the album debuted at number 1 and stayed there for 7 weeks.\nShortly thereafter, the second single produced by Thorsten Brötzmann was decoupled from the album.

It was certified platinum in Germany, and certified Gold in both Austria and Switzerland.\nAt the end of September 2005, Banaroo received a gold record in Germany for more than 150,000 singles sold and a platinum record for more than 200,000 albums sold. Also in Switzerland and in Austria single and album were each awarded gold.\nFor their success, Banaroo was nominated as best newcomer both for the pop music award Comet of the German music broadcaster VIVA and for the Echo.\nAfter the expiry of the TV series came on August 8, 2005, the DVD Banaroo - The Movie! on the market. In addition to the three music videos for Dubi Dam Dam, Space Cowboy and Make You See the Stars and five other live recordings, the DVD contains three non-broadcast episodes of the Star Diary .

As bonus material Outtakes of the series were packed on the DVD.\n\n\n=== Christmas World ===\nJust five months after the debut, the follow-up album was released on 25 November 2005 under the title Christmas World, a compilation of well-known Christmas carols, which were re-recorded by Banaroo. The album was again produced by Carsten Wegener and Timo Hohnholz.\nThe only newly composed song on the album was Coming Home for Christmas, which was previously released as a single.

    "text": "Lord Huron is a Los Angeles-based American indie rock band composed of Mark Barry (drums, percussion), Miguel Briseño (bass, keyboard, theremin), Tom Renaud (guitar), and founder Ben Schneider (guitar, lead vocals). They released their debut album Lonesome Dreams in 2012, their second album Strange Trails in 2015, and their fourth and most recent album Long Lost in 2021.\nLord Huron combines country, western, folk rock, rock and roll, pop melodies, and surf rock with soundtrack and new age influences to produce a sound The Wall Street Journal described as having \"a decidedly cinematic flair, heavy on mood and evocative imagery. Lord Huron brings to mind the high-lonesome sound of antecedents like the Band, Neil Young, My Morning Jacket and Fleet Foxes\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation (2010–2011) ===\nSchneider began writing music in his hometown of Okemos, Michigan before studying visual arts at the University of Michigan and in France then moving to New York City where he worked as an artist. After moving to Los Angeles, in 2010 Schneider formed Lord Huron as a solo project, recording a few EPs on his own and enlisting musicians to play in live shows. The band's name was inspired by Lake Huron, which Schneider grew up visiting.\n\n\n=== Lonesome Dreams (2012–2013) ===\nLord Huron's first full-length album, Lonesome Dreams, was released on October 9, 2012. It debuted at No. 5 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums chart.\nWith the release of Lonesome Dreams, the band released a series of music videos filmed in a western '70s style, which Schneider says was the focal point and narrative for the album. \"We had this fun idea that Lonesome Dreams was kind of this series of old adventure tales.\" In an interview, Schneider alluded to influence from a specific work, called The Collected Works of Billy the Kid: Left-Handed Poems. \"It's sort of a collection of pulp fiction and we wanted the videos to kind of reflect that and have that same feel and style\", Schneider said during another interview. They also decided to release a theatrical version of the videos.\n\n\n=== Strange Trails (2014–2017) ===\nThe band released their second album, Strange Trails, on April 6, 2015 in the UK and April 7, 2015 in the US. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at No. 23, Folk Albums at No. 1, and No. 10 on the Top Album Sales chart with 18,000 copies sold. \nOn June 2, 2015, the song Ends of the Earth from Lonesome Dreams was featured in the finale of Community,  Emotional Consequences of Broadcast Television \nThe song \"The Night We Met\" was RIAA certified gold on June 26, 2017 and certified platinum on February 15, 2018. The song was used in the series 13 Reasons Why, in Season 1. It was later remixed in 2018 to feature Phoebe Bridgers for Season 2.\n\n\n=== Vide Noir (2018–2020) ===\nIn January 2018, several short videos with audio clips on Lord Huron's Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts led to speculation of an album release. The band's third album, Vide Noir, was announced to be released on April 20, 2018.\nOn January 26, 2018, Lord Huron released their first single from the album, a two-part song called \"Ancient Names\". On February 16, 2018, the band released the next single, \"Wait by the River\". On March 7, 2018 they performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.\nLord Huron performed an extended preview of Vide Noir on March 8, 2018, at Teragram Ballroom in Los Angeles. They debuted five songs off the new album: \"Ancient Names (Part I)\", \"Ancient Names (Part II)\", \"Wait by the River\", \"Never Ever\", and \"Vide Noir\". On March 27, 2018, they performed another preview set at Le Poisson Rouge in New York. They played the same five new songs as at Teragram Ballroom plus two more songs from the yet-to-be-released album, \"When the Night Is Over\" and \"Back from the Edge\".\nOn the day of the album release, April 20, 2018, Lord Huron played a release show in Grand Rapids in Schneider's home state of Michigan.\nOn July 11, 2018, Lord Huron recorded two Spotify Singles, \"When the Night is Over\" and Neil Young's \"Harvest Moon\" at Spotify Studios.\nOn August 11, 2018, the band performed a medley of \"Never Ever, When the Night is Over\" and \"Moonbeam\" from Vide Noir on the CBS This Morning: Saturday Sessions.\n\n\n=== Long Lost (2021–present) ===\nIn December 2020, the band announced a collection of live-streamed shows entitled Alive from Whispering Pines. The first episode aired on January 7, 2021, and featured a clip of previously-unreleased material. On February 19, 2021, a day after the second episode of Alive from Whispering Pines, the band released a new single, \"Not Dead Yet\".\nOn March 18, 2021, the third episode of Alive from Whispering Pines concluded with the supposed title of their upcoming fourth studio album, Long Lost, as well as an expected release date of May 21, 2021. This was confirmed when the album became available for pre-order on iTunes, Amazon, and other music vendors. On March 19, 2021, the \"Mine Forever\" single was released, which had been previewed in the second episode of Alive from Whispering Pines. On April 30, 2021, another single from Long Lost was released, \"I Lied\", featuring American singer-songwriter Allison Ponthier.\nThe album was released on the band's Whispering Pines label on May 21, 2021 to \"universal acclaim\".\nIn 2022, the band toured Canada with Leith Ross.

    "text": "The following is a list of Wu-Tang Clan affiliates, collectively known as the Wu-Tang Killa Bees (occasionally spelt \"Beez\", an appellation originating from the 1998 compilation RZA presents Wu-Tang Killa Bees: The Swarm, Volume 1). These are artists that are at times promoted, supported, or produced by the members of the hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, and/or groups formed by Clan members as side projects.  The association of these artists with the Clan varies considerably both in nature and over time.\nThese affiliates also include the Clan's group of in-house producers known as the Wu-Elements.  This originally referred to the group who assisted RZA with the production of the Clan's second album Wu-Tang Forever, on which some production duties were delegated to True Master, 4th Disciple and Clan member Inspectah Deck.  However, although he was not credited for production on Wu-Tang Forever, the traditional definition of Wu-Elements usually also includes Allah Mathematics due to his long-time involvement with the Clan as both a producer and DJ as well as his prolific input as a producer on the group's second round of solo projects between 1997 and 2000.  Since 2000, the usage of the term \"Wu-Elements\" has tended to include close affiliate producers Bronze Nazareth and Cilvaringz.\n\n\n== Groups ==\n\n\n=== 1.4.0. Productions ===\n1.4.0. Productions is a team of producers from Staten Island associated with Theodore Unit. The group consists of Sean Sulivan (a.k.a. shorte), T Diddy, Just 1, Chapel and Cheesey Rat (a.k.a. Charles Walker). The group releases mixtapes/bootlegs with affiliates rapping.\n\n\n=== A.I.G. ===\nA.I.G. is a duo composed of Allah Wise (a.k.a. The Wizard), and Darkim Be Allah. The group, whose name stands for \"Allah Is God\", debuted on the Wu-Tang Killa Bees: The Swarm compilation with the track \"Bronx War Stories\". An album titled Retaliation Strike was completed but was never released, a situation which eventually caused the group to leave the Clan and pursue an independent route.  They eventually released their debut Fame Labs Presents in 2005. Stefano and Mike joined the group in 2011 as interns, but quickly escalated, with songs accounting for their daily trials and tribulations as interns. In 2012, Stefano and Mike were offered to continue their careers at A.I.G. on a full-time basis.\n\n\n=== Achozen ===\n\n\n=== American Cream Team ===\nThe American Cream Team were created in 1999. They consist of Chip Banks (died November 25, 2000), Polite (died August 1, 2023) (who would join Rae's second group Ice Water Inc.), Lord Superb (died October 9, 2018) (who was featured on Rae and Ghost albums), Twiz (who would later become part of Ghost's Theodore Unit), Triflyn (St. Lunatics affiliate and DJ for Nelly), RhymeReck, and producers Arkatech Beatz. Raekwon featured American Cream Team on two songs on his second album Immobilarity. Much of that album was produced by Arkatech Beatz and Triflyn. They were notably a Clan member's first offspring crew. The group also made several appearances on mixtapes and compilations, including a track titled \"It's Not A Game\" produced by Arkatech Beatz on the soundtrack to the film Black and White which was played over the film's credits, and a track on Funkmaster Flex's The Mix Tape, Vol. III mixtape. Members of the group also made appearances on albums by Raekwon's fellow Clansmen Ghostface Killah's Supreme Clientele. After 50 Cent dissed the Wu, along with others, on his infamous track \"How to Rob\", Polite and Lord Superb responded with a track called \"Who the Fuck is 50 Cent?\" followed by Raekwon's Clyde Smith skit off of Ghostface Killah's album. Before Chip Banks' death, he worked on several songs including \"Ain't Nobody\" (featuring Billystone), \"Club Life\", \"Everywhere We Go\", \"Hold Your Head\", \"Heavyweight Champion\", \"World Order\" (featuring Outlawz), \"Flashbacks\" & \"Niggas Don't Die\". Banks died on November 25, 2000 due to a shooting over a money dispute, and Cream Team split up. Like many Wu affiliates, American Cream Team completed an album, \"Only In America\", but it has never been released (despite being advertised in the liner notes of other Wu-Tang releases). Since then, Lord Superb & Twiz have been incarcerated, though both were finally able to release a few official mixtapes. Rhyme Recka continues to record solo material and released an album titled The Autobiography of Rapper X in 2008.\n\n\n=== Black Knights ===\n\nOne of the many Wu-affiliates to debut on The Swarm compilation, the Californian group Black Knights was originally associated with the group North Star (also from California) with whom they recorded as Black Knights of the North Star.

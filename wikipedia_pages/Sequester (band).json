    "text": "Sequester is a Canadian heavy metal project created by Ryan Boc in 2005. Ryan Boc remains the sole member, writing and performing all of the material thus far. The music also draws inspiration from other genres such as progressive and psychedelic rock, traditional English and Scottish folk, grunge, alternative rock, blues, jazz, and classical. Common lyrical themes include fantasy, history, folklore, mythology, human nature, and spirituality; they are sung in a clean voice but often with thrashy, more aggressive overtones.  The songs are usually polyphonic, long in duration due to complex structuring and arrangement, and frequently contain harmonized vocal and guitar layering.\n\n\n== Members ==\nRyan Boc – vocals, guitar, bass, drums and keyboard\n\n\n== Guest musicians ==\nKelli Gose – background vocals on the demo version of Homeland from Visions of the Erlking.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nVisions of the Erlking (Demo) – 2007\nWinter Shadows – 2008\nNameless One (EP) – 2009\nShaping Life and Soul – 2011\nAncestry (EP) – 2012\nMissing Image – 2014\nHermit – 2018\n\n\n== Artwork ==\nThe Sequester logo was designed by Andre Guillemette, a Canadian graphic designer notable for working with both Savage Circus and Dark Empire\nCover Art:\n\nVisions of the Erlking, Winter Shadows, and Shaping Life and Soul featured digital artwork by Ryan Boc.\nNameless One was drawn by American artist Jonathan Elliott.\nAncestry was painted by Ryan's friend and neighbour, Rachel Jackson.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial site\nFacebook\nCDBaby\nBandcamp\nYouTube\nMySpace\nSoundclick"

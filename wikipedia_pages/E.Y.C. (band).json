At the 1993 Smash Hits Poll Winners Party, the trio were the first group to win the Best Roadshow Act award; the award would launch the careers of Boyzone, Backstreet Boys and many more in the following years. The band also toured with Whitney Houston during The Bodyguard World Tour and Prince.\nThey scored six top 40 hits in the UK Singles Chart before disbanding.

The band performed on Nickelodeon's All That Music & More Festivals and support slots on the Backstreet Boys' Into the Millennium Tour, with appearances on Donny & Marie as part of the release.\nSince E.Y.C. disbanded, Parker has been touring with LA Allstars, while Butler has performed as Limp Wristed.

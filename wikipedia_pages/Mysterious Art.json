    "text": "Mysterious Art is a German electronic dance music group founded in 1987. The group became famous for its hit single \"Das Omen”.\n\n\n== History ==\nMysterious Art was founded in 1987 by Michael Krautter (keyboards and mouse) end Diter Bohlen who composed and produced the instrumental of \"Das Omen\" in September 1988. By December 1988, copies of this instrumental were played throughout the whole German club scene, and sparked the interest of DJ Mike Staab and the record label CBS. Vocals for the debut single \"Das Omen\" were added and recorded at Cream Studios in Frankfurt in January 1989. The single saw its first release on May 13, 1989. The song quickly reached the #1 position of the official German Media Control singles charts, where it remained for nine weeks straight. The song sold over 490,000 singles in Germany alone and has since remained the most successful published work under CBS Publishing GmbH.\nThe song prominently sampled part of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana and Goethe's Faust. The lyrics refer to the pact with the devil, the main motif of Faust.\nMysterious Art also toured as the opening act for Madonna's Blond Ambition Tour in Germany.\nTheir second single, \"Carma - Omen 2\" reached #9 on the German charts and remained there for three weeks. It was followed up by the album Omen – The Story in the fall of 1989. In 1991, the band published their second album, Mystic Mountains. \nIn 2011 Nicole Boeúf (now Kolb) and Michael Krautter reformed Mysterious Art and played some shows on and off from 2012 until 2019.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMichael Krautter - keyboards, programming\nNicole Boeúf - vocals\nStephanie Trautmann - backing vocals\nTillmann Uhrmacher - bass\nMike Staab - drums, producer\n\n\n== Life after the band ==\nIn 1994, Mike Staab produced Magic Affair as a Eurodance follow-up group.

Mike Staab died on May 11, 2009, from a heart attack.\nMichael Krautter moved to Canada and continues to work as a composer and producer for music and film.

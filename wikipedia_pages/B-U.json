During this time they were already in pursuance of their own careers in the music industry; Ursela as the hip-hop recording artist “FIN” and Steven Bernard as the R&B recording artist “Bishop the RBP”.  Ursela Camille (then FIN) would share stages with artists Wyclef Jean, Ginuwine, DMX, Lil' Kim, Lost Boyz & Escape, as well as a host of others. Steven Bernard (then Bishop the RBP) sang in local clubs and social events and worked on sharpening his production skills under the teaching of music producer, Jimmy Brown of EJ Productions.  They worked together on several music recording projects, as well as stage productions such as A Streetcar Named Desire and Strong Woman.\nIn 2003, Bernard began to live a life of Christianity and, in 2004, Camille began a similar lifestyle.

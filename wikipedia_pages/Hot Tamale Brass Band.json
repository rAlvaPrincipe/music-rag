    "text": "Hot Tamale Brass Band is a brass band that plays traditional New Orleans jazz, dixieland, jazz funeral and funky second line music. The band is based in the Boston area. The band has nine full-time members, sometimes performing as small as a quintet, other times performing with as many as 42 members for a Disney [1] special event.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Hot Tamale Brass Band was formed in 1992 after their leader, Mickey Bones, moved from New Orleans to Boston. The band took up Sunday residency for the next three years at The Plough and Stars in Cambridge, Massachusetts to build a local fan base and develop new material.\n\n\n== Performances ==\nThe Hot Tamale Brass Band have performed in many venues such as: the Krewe of Bacchus Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cambridge River Festival, the Somerville Theater, First Night Boston, the Berklee Performance Center. and they participated in a well received \"party crash\" of the radical HONK! festival parade in 2008. They are probably best known for performing over 800 concerts for the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park for every home game since the year 2000. The band is occasionally asked to dress up in black suit and tie to perform at a New Orleans style jazz funeral. The band needs no amplification so, the mobility of the group has allowed them to perform while being propelled by scullers up the Charles River or on the back of a fire truck in downtown Boston playing dixieland music.\nThe band has made appearances on Sesame Street, Nickelodeon, the 2005 remake of Fever Pitch by the Farrelly brothers [2] and have been recently filmed for Ken Burns' Baseball-10th Inning documentary.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nLive at the Shrunken Head (1999)\nLive at the Screaming Torso (2009)\nLive at the Ballpark (2010)\n\n\n== References ==\nAll About Jazz: Interview by music critic Brett Milano in the Boston Phoenix\nFever Pitch movie credits\nHot Tamale Brass Band plays for Disney\nHot Tamale Brass Band at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nCD Baby\nHot Tamale Brass Band myspace page"

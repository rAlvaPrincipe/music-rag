In 1992, Andermad left the group and created Gang Wild after Dj San Mix became the second DJ of the group, staying for a while and soon after the time came the DJ Adriano was invited to participate in the group. DJ Adriano was in the group for twelve years, between 1992 and 2004 and was replaced by DJ Master Jay, a former member of Sistema Negro. Master Jay lasted only one year and then was replaced by DJ and music producer Dj Luiz Só Monstro who later produced the album 'strong firm' in 2013, and is still in the group. .\nIn 1992, the group participated in the collection Consciousness Project Rap Brazil, with the songs \"Slave Ship\" and \"Town Without Law,\" which began to be played on Radio Metropolitana FM.

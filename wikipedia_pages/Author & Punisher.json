    "text": "Author & Punisher is a one-man band from San Diego, formed in January 2004 by mechanical engineer and artist Tristan Shone. Most of the instrumentation and controllers Shone uses, called \"Drone Machines\" and \"Dub Machines\", are custom-designed and fabricated by Shone from raw materials and open-source electronic circuitry. Shone was inspired to build his own instruments to achieve the sound he wanted that conventional instruments could not accomplish and the difficulty in finding band members.\nShone has released nine albums as Author & Punisher, with Melk en Honing (2015) and Pressure Mine (2017) released through Phil Anselmo's record label Housecore Records. His latest, Kr√ºller, was released by Relapse Records on February 11, 2022.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n== References =="

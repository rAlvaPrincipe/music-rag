    "text": "The Old Dominion University Monarch Marching Band (MMB) is the Marching Band put in place in response to the formation of the Old Dominion Monarchs football program. It was founded in the summer of 2008 by Dr. Alexander Trevino. The MMB is currently under the direction of Mr. David Enloe.  The Monarch Marching Band goes to all of the home football games and plays in the pre-game, stands, and halftime. The band prides itself on the fact that it does not do the same show for every football game, and it is fairly rare for the band to play the same song more than once for halftime.\n\n\n== Sections ==\nThe MMB has a standard line up of sections for a college band. All of the wind instruments are silver and are provided by the university.\nInstruments are: \nPiccolos,\nClarinets,\nSaxophones,\nMellophones,\nTrumpets,\nTrombones,\nBaritones,\nSousaphones,\nSnares,\nTenors,\nBass drums,\nCymbals, and\nColor guard.\n\n\n== Traditions ==\nEven as a young marching band, The MMB has many traditions. One tradition includes yelling “Pride” after the conclusion of each practice and game. This has a double meaning - pride in the sense of being proud to be a Monarch, and also pride referring to a grouping of lions. \nAnother tradition of the MMB is to rub the belly of the Big Blue statue in the entrance of the Webb Center for good luck before games. \n\n\n== Uniforms ==\nThe uniforms for the MMB are quite representative of the city they reside in. Norfolk, Virginia houses a huge Naval station (Naval Station Norfolk) and almost in respect of that, their uniforms look very Navy-like. The pants come up in an overall fashion and the coat is a high cut, button-from- the-shoulder type of style. The Shako looks almost identical to a Naval Peaked cap. The color scheme of the uniform is the schools colors, Royal Blue and white. Coincidentally this is also the colors of the Navy. The uniform is adorned with multiple university logos. 'Old Dominion University' on the right shoulder, and the diagonal ODU with crown logo on the left shoulder. The lion shield logo is on the front of the jacket, with M-O-N-A-R-C-H-S spelled vertically down the back. On the front of the Shako, the horizontal ODU with crown logo is present.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Monarch Marching Band Webpage\nOfficial Facebook Page\nOfficial Twitter\nOfficial Youtube"

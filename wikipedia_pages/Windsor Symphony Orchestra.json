    "text": "The Windsor Symphony Orchestra is a Canadian orchestra located in Windsor, Ontario.  The orchestra performs in Southwestern Ontario, at the Capitol Theatre, Home of the WSO.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Windsor Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1941, originally as the Windsor Concert Orchestra. The name was changed to The Windsor Symphony in 1948. The orchestra’s first conductor was Matti Holli, who remained with the orchestra until his death in 1977. \nThe most recent Canadian conductor to be appointed as music director was Dwight Bennett in 1986. Under Bennett, the orchestra became fully professional but also ran into financial difficulties through unrealized revenue projections and a musician's strike in 1988. He was succeeded by American conductor Susan Haig in 1991. Music director from 2001 to 2012 was American conductor John Morris Russell. During his tenure, the orchestra received a Juno nomination for their recording of Peter and the Wolf & Last Minute Lulu. The orchestra also earned several other awards, including two Ontario Lieutenant Governor's awards for the arts. He conducted his last concert as music director on May 12, 2012. On Feb 26, 2013, the Windsor Symphony Orchestra announced the appointment of Robert Franz as their sixth music director. Franz is the third American conductor to be appointed to the position.  \nThe Windsor Symphony Orchestra performs at several venues in the Windsor-Essex County area but, since the beginning of the 2012–2013 season, is based at the historic Capitol Theatre in downtown Windsor, a restored former movie house.

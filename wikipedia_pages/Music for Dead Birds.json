    "text": "Music for Dead Birds are an anti-folk band from Galway and County Mayo, Ireland. Its members are Jimmy Monaghan (vocals, guitar) and Dónal Walsh (drums).\n\n\n== History ==\nMusic for Dead Birds formed in Galway city in 2007. In April, 2009, they released their debut album \"And then it rained for seven days\" on the Irish independent record label Rusted Rail. The album was self produced by the band and was mainly recorded using a 4-track tape deck.  Foxy Digitalis commented \"The additional album info describes the recording as taking place in \"various sheds, attics & bedrooms in Galway and Mayo.\" The end result represents clear intentions and highly creative song writing and recording techniques.\" However, it was also criticised for its lo-fi quality. The song Four Years From Now went on to feature on the soundtrack of the German art project Centerland, which was released by Jellyfant Records in 2013. \nIn October 2011, the group released their second album \"The Pope's Sister\". AU Magazine said : \"Over ten short tracks – each one as good as the next – Jimmy Monaghan and co meld Beta Band-esque charm with boldly erratic time signatures and disaffected fuzz.\" Terrascope also praised the album stating: \"By the time you get to “Release the Dogs” you find you are fully immersed in the album, the twisted guitar lines hooking you in with relentless ease.\" It was listed by Irish radio DJ Dan Hegarty as one of the top 50 Irish albums of 2011.\nThe group's third album \"Vitamins\" was released on 17 April 2014, by the band's own Ghost Home Recordings label, as both a Pay what you want digital download and a limited edition CD run of 100 copies. The album was recorded in one weekend at Data Studios, County Kerry, with recording engineer Tadgh Healy. Critical reception of the album was mixed, with Irish website GoldenPlec referring to it as a \"flawed project\", while in a more positive review Ptolemaic Terrascope opined: \"The sudden stop/starts, so beloved of Seattle residents, do sometimes get a little wearing, but it's never less than intriguing listening, and the good songs have their own chutzpah.\" Lead track The Farmer's Corn was broadcast by 2fm in Ireland and 2SER in Australia. A music video was produced for the track Magic Witch which received some media attention for its dark content.\nThey have played with artists such as Lite (band), Angus & Julia Stone Woodpigeon (band), And So I Watch You From Afar & Girl Band (Irish band) in Galway & Mayo. They have also appeared at 93 Feet East in London, The Space (Connecticut) & The Living Room in New York.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\n\"And then it rained for seven days\" 3\" CD Mini-Album, 2009\n\"The Pope's Sister\" CD Album, 2011\n\"Vitamins\" CD/Digital, 2014\n\"Pagan Blessings\" Digital, 2018\nEP's\n\n\"The Day The Water Ran Out\", 2009.

    "text": "Goodie Mob is an American hip hop group based in Atlanta, Georgia, consisting of CeeLo Green, Khujo, T-Mo, and Big Gipp.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was formed in 1991 by Cameron \"Big Gipp\" Gipp, Willie \"Khujo\" Knighton Jr., CeeLo Green (born Thomas Callaway), and Robert \"T-Mo\" Barnett in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1995, Goodie Mob released their debut album, Soul Food, which was critically acclaimed and certified Gold. The album aired social and political issues such as racism, discrimination, geopolitics, and gentrification. Their debut single \"Cell Therapy\" reached number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also topped the Billboard Hot Rap Singles chart. Goodie Mob is part of the hip hop/R&B musical collective, Dungeon Family, also based in Atlanta. Like numerous musicians in Atlanta's hip hop scene, their career would in fact emerge from the so-called \"Dungeon,\" the name given to the recording studio which was located in the basement Rico Wade's mother.\nIn 1998, Goodie Mob released their second album, Still Standing. The album continued the group's style of social commentary, and CeeLo's singing talents were used more frequently. The group's third album, World Party, veered away from their gritty style and instead incorporated lighter beats and party related subject matter. During its production, CeeLo left the group to pursue a solo career when he was unhappy with the project's direction. Goodie Mob's fourth album, One Monkey Don't Stop No Show, was released in 2004 and suffered a poor reception, resulting in Big Gipp also leaving the group. T-Mo and Khujo formed the duo Lumberjacks, which they released the album Livin' Life as Lumberjacks in 2005. Big Gipp, as part of the duo Ali & Gipp, released their album Kinfolk in 2006.\nAlso in 2006, all four members of Goodie Mob performed together following a Gnarls Barkley concert, marking the group's reunion. In 2011, Goodie Mob signed with Elektra Records and worked on a new album, which would eventually become Age Against the Machine, released in 2013.\nAfter a seven years gap, they released a new album Survival Kit in November 2020.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nOn August 19, 2008, Goodie Mob performed on stage together unannounced at the Tabernacle in Atlanta during a free Nelly concert.\nOn September 19, 2009, Goodie Mob performed for the first official reunion concert at the Masquerade in Atlanta, Georgia. The group also performed with all the original members at the Smoke Out festival in San Bernardino, California, on October 23, 2009.\nAs of 2011, Goodie Mob is signed with Elektra Records.\nOn March 12, 2010, Goodie Mob performed \"Get Rich to This\" in Las Vegas, Nevada, for part of the Red Bull Soundclash concert that featured CeeLo.\nOn April 28, 2011, CeeLo brought out Goodie Mob during his performance at Sunfest in West Palm Beach, Florida. The group performed four songs together, including \"Black Ice (Sky High)\", \"Cell Therapy\", and \"Soul Food\".\nOn July 25, 2011, CeeLo announced via his Twitter that Goodie Mob's reunion album would be titled We Sell Drugs Too.  However, in February 2012 CeeLo tweeted that the name has been changed to Age Against the Machine.\nAfter Survival Kit was released on November 13, 2020, the group planned to start touring in December 2020.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Films ===\nMystery Men (1999)\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\nGit Up, Git Out (1994)\nGive It 2 You (1995)\nWhat It Ain't (2000)\nSo Fresh, So Clean (2001)\nDungeon Family - Trans DF Express (2001)\nSpecial Education (2013)\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe 10th Annual Soul Train Music Awards (1996)\nRed Hot & Rap (1996)\nTeen Summit (1998)\nSister, Sister (1998)\nThe 1999 Source Hip-Hop Music Awards (1999)\nSoul Train (1996-2000), 3 episodes\n14th Annual Soul Train Music Awards (2000)\nShowtime at the Apollo (2000)\nThe 2012 Billboard Music Awards (2012)\nUnsung (2020)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\nSoul Food (1995)\nStill Standing (1998)\nWorld Party (1999)\nOne Monkey Don't Stop No Show (2004)\nAge Against the Machine (2013)\nSurvival Kit (2020)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKhujo on the Willie Isz project in HHC Digital magazine\nHow Cell Therapy predicted the social effects of a pandemic\nSurvival Kit single \"No Cigar\" review"

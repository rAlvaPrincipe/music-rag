    "text": "Orange Blossom is a French band that plays a mix of electronic and world music. \nThe band was formed in Nantes in 1993 with Pierre-Jean Chabot (known as PJ Chabot) on violin and Jean-Christophe Waechter (known as Jay C.) on percussions and vocals.  The band is named after a 1920s train immortalised by Ervin Rouse and Chubby Wise's fiddle tune \"Orange Blossom Special\".\nIn 1994, Éric (organ) joined the band and a first audio tape was recorded in September.\nIn 1995 the band stabilized with the arrival of Carlos Robles Arenas on drums, djembé, and sample, and the departure of Éric.\nTheir first disc, Orange Blossom, came out in 1997 on the Prikosnovénie label, selling 15,000 copies.\nBefore their second album came out, the group was influenced by ethnic and traditional music. They met and collaborated with several non-French artists, like Ivorian percussion group Yelemba D'Abidjan and Egyptian group Ganoub. They toured in Egypt, France, and Belgium. Vocalist Jay C. left the band in 2000 and created Prajña. In 2002, percussionist Mathias Vaguenez and vocalist Leïla Bounous joined the group. The album Everything Must Change came out in 2005 on the Bonsaï Music label.\nCarlos Robles Arenas is Mexican. Leïla Bounous is part Algerian, part Moorish, part Breton. She later left and Hend El Rawy from Egypt, joined the band in 2014.\nTheir third album, Under the Shade of Violets came out in 2014. Most of the band's songs are sung in Arabic. \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nSelf-produced 6 title audio tape (1994)\nPrayer\nChild & Doll\nSpeedman\nWelcome In My Brain\nJesse's Grandfather\nRed Orange Blossom\nSelf-produced 4 title audio tape (1996)\nRay\nDie Stadt\nBali\nMy Village\nOrange Blossom (1997)\nAnaconda Girl\nMaria Del Sol\nBata\nN.\nDie Stadt\nI'm Dying\nTrinity\nEverything Must Change (2005) (SNEP FRANCE: Peak #141)\nMaldito (Cursed)\nHabibi (My Darling)\nCheft El Khof (I've Seen Fear)\nDesert Dub\nNafsi (My Soul)\nSouffrance\nBlama\nYazaman (A Long Time Ago)\nDenya (Life)\nBendimina (My Heart Is Aching)\nAyoub (hidden track)\nUnder the Shade of Violets (2014) (SNEP FRANCE: Peak #84)\nOmmaty\nLost\nYa Sîdî\nPitcha\nJerusalem\nMaria\nGoodbye Kô\nMexico\nThe Nubian\nBlack Box\nPink Ma\nAqua\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOrange Blossom on Myspace\nPrikosnovénie (French, audio samples)\nBonsaï Music (French, audio samples)\nOrange Blossom discography at MusicBrainz"

    "text": "Laysha (Hangul: 레이샤) is a South Korean girl group formed by JS Entertainment but is now currently under S Media Entertainment. The group currently consists of four members: Goeun, Chaejin, Jian, and Bitna. They debuted on May 12, 2015, with the single \"Turn Up The Music\". Laysha are known for their risqué concepts when performing, which they went viral for in 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Formation ===\nBefore LAYSHA, Goeun and Chaejin debuted as members of the short-lived girl group LXIA in 2012 with the single \"Sexy Brown\".\n\n\n=== Debut, line-up changes and Chocolate Cream ===\nLAYSHA was formed in September 2014 by JS Entertainment, consisting of five members: Goeun, Becky (now known by her real name, Chaejin), Som, Yoobin and Seulgi. Initially, the group was a dance cover team, known for their risque, provocative performance styles, which would lead them to go viral in 2015, with fancams of Goeun attracting millions of views.\nLAYSHA made their debut on May 12, 2015 with the single \"Turn Up The Music\". Shortly after the group's debut, however, Seulgi would silently leave the group and Choim would join. In August 2015, Laysha would premiere two new original songs live, \"Hello\" and \"Good Bye My Boy\", as well as announce \"Hello\" as their upcoming second single alongside a concert announcement. A choreography video with the full studio version of \"Hello\" would be posted however, neither song was ever released. Later in 2015, Choim would silently leave, followed by Yoobin in early 2016. Shortly after, Hyeri was revealed as a new member.\nOn July 20, 2016, Laysha made their first comeback as four members with the single \"Chocolate Cream\", gaining more recognition in the K-Pop community as well as gaining millions of views on their official MV, which has been called one of the sexiest K-Pop music videos. Laysha would follow with their success with their third single, \"Party Tonight\", later that year.\n\n\n=== Pink Label and controversy ===\nOn December 18, 2017, Laysha made their next comeback with their single \"Pink Label\". On August 29, 2018, Laysha were involved in a controversy with their label, JS Entertainment, when Som and Goeun revealed cameras were placed in their rooms and bathrooms to spy on them, accusing their company of placing them there. The public in social media suspected that Laysha had lied about the hidden cameras. Goeun denied the accusations that Laysha was using the controversy over the hidden cameras for marketing purposes and LAYSHA parted ways with JS.\nFollowing the controversy, Laysha left JS Entertainment and formed their own company, A1 Entertainment, with Hyeri leaving LAYSHA in early 2019 and Som, affected by the spying event, as well as other personal reasons, deciding to leave the group later that year after a lengthy hiatus. In 2019, new members Sia, Hayeon and Hayoung were introduced as new members, however, Hayoung and Hayeon left after barely a month to rejoin their original group, May Queen, also managed by A1, which had recently reformed. Boreum was then introduced, with Laysha releasing a new single, \"Freedom\", in late 2019. Laysha announced an EP would be releasing in the spring of 2020, however, this release did not happen.\n\n\n=== Comeback and new members ===\nOn January 27, 2023, Laysha announced in news articles and on social media that \"LAYSHA is back!\", revealing plans for new music. On March 29, however, Boreum left Laysha due to health issues.\nOn April 3 and 4th, profiles for new members Rahye and Bitna were released to social media. On April 11, Laysha officially revealed full-scale comeback plans, with their first solo concert in Seoul on June 9, where Laysha will premiere their new song. Furthermore, Laysha will hold their first fan meeting and mention plans for their first \"U.S. album\".\nOn February 1, 2024 guest member DJ Ina left the group.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nGoeun (고은) – 2014–present\nChaejin (채진) – 2014–present\nBitna (빛나) – 2023–present\nJian (지안) – 2024–present\n\n\n=== Former ===\nYoobin (유빈) – 2014–2015\nSeulgi (슬기) – 2014–2015\nChoim (초임) – 2015 (temporary member)\nSom (솜) – 2015-2019\nHyeri (혜리) – 2015-2019\nHayoung (하영) – 2019 (temporary member)\nHayeon (하연) – 2019 (temporary member)\nHadam (하담) – 2019 (temporary member)\nSemi (세미) – 2021 (temporary member)\nBoreum (보름) – 2019-2023\nRahye (라혜) – 2023\nDJ Ina (디제이이나) – 2023–2024\nSia (시아) – 2019–2024\n\n\n=== Member Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSingles\n2015: \"Turn up the Music\"\n2016: \"Party Tonight\"\n2016: \"Chocolate Cream\"\n2017: \"Pink Label\"\n2019: \"Freedom\" (프리덤)\n2023: \"붉은 꽃\"(Red Flower)\n2023: \"Summer Night\"\n2023: \"YES or NOT\"\n2024: \"CHOCOLATE CREAM.II\"\n2024: \"LAYSHA Party Tonight\"\n2024: \"Domino\"\nUnreleased\n2015: Hello\n2015: Good Bye My Boy\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFacebook Official\nInstagram Official"

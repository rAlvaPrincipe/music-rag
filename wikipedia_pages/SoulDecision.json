    "text": "soulDecision was a Canadian pop band active from 1993 to 2005. They are best known for the single, \"Faded\", which hit number-one in Canada in 2000, and \"Ooh It's Kinda Crazy\", which became a hit as well the following year in early 2001.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe group was formed in Vancouver, British Columbia under the original name 'Indecision' by singer and multi-instrumentalist Trevor Guthrie, singer David Bowman, and keyboard player Ken Lewko, who were studying music together at Capilano College. Before signing a record deal, they released a couple of singles that received national top 40 radio airplay. The success of those singles led them to a record deal with Universal Music. However, due to a name conflict with an American band, they reluctantly changed their name from Indecision; they allowed their manager, Garry Francis, to choose the new name soulDecision. Launched at the height of the boy band era, they nonetheless wrote their own songs and played their own instruments. \nThe group's first studio album, No One Does It Better, was recorded in Velvet Sound Studios in Sydney, Australia and released on February 22, 2000, in Canada. The album's lead single \"Faded\", an up-tempo pop tune mixed with R&B and featuring a rap sequence by Thrust, was a hit in Canada, reaching number one on the country's singles chart. It also reached number 22 in the United States. The follow-up single, \"Ooh It's Kinda Crazy\", also was a hit in North America, and at one time became the number one request on MTV's Total Request Live. In 2018, Billboard named the video as one of the top ten \"Greatest Boy Band Videos of the TRL Era\" alongside Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and 98 Degrees.\nIn July 2000 they toured Canada as part of YTV's Psykoblast Tour, supporting Christina Aguilera and also headlining the Canadian tour in 2001. In late 2000 they toured along with Destiny's Child, as support act for Aguilera's Genie in a Bottle Tour throughout North America. They were the support act for NSYNC on the Eastern North America dates of Leg 2 of the No Strings Attached Tour in 2000.\nThe band departed Universal and released their second album, Shady Satin Drug, in 2004 through the label Sextant. The album's first single was \"Cadillac Dress\", released as a download from the band's website. After the album's release, Sextant filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

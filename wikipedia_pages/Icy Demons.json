    "text": "Icy Demons is an experimental music project started by Bablicon's Griffin Rodriguez (credited as Blue Hawaii) and Man Man / Need New Body's Christopher Powell (Pow Pow).  A project of various Chicago musicians, they have released three albums, Fight Back! on the Elephant 6-associated label Cloud Recordings, Tears of a Clone on Eastern Developments Music, and Miami Ice on the label started by Rodriguez and Powell called Obey Your Brain.\n\n\n== Influences and style ==\nDemons can be seen as a continuation of the Canterbury scene, which involved acts like Soft Machine and Robert Wyatt. They do, however, move into new ground by mixing this Canterbury style with a noticeable Krautrock influence, especially that of Can. Some melodic lines and rhythmic patterns are strongly reminiscent of Frank Zappa's compositions. Other similar acts include Aksak Maboul, Pit er Pat, Pop-off Tuesday, Lightning Bolt, and Cheer-Accident.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n(2004) Fight Back!\n(2005) Jump Off 7\" b/w Pit Er Pat \n(2006) Tears of a Clone \n(2008) Miami Ice\n\n\n== Members (past and present) ==\nGriffin Rodriguez a.k.a.

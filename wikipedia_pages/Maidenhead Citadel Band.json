    "text": "Maidenhead Citadel Band (MCB) is a Salvation Army Band and part of the Maidenhead Corps of The Salvation Army.  For over 120 years the band has consistently contributed to the worship and evangelical outreach promoted by the Maidenhead Corps in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.\n\n\n== Brief history ==\nThe Band can trace its history back to 1886 when William Thomas, a young farmer from the Salisbury area moved to Maidenhead and became the first Bandmaster of Maidenhead Citadel Band.\nOn 25 June 1892, 18 members of Maidenhead Band were arrested during an open-air meeting as they \"unlawfully obstructed the free passage of the Highway by standing together for the space of twenty minutes.\"  Bandmaster William Thomas took responsibility for the Band's actions and was sentenced to several months manual labour in Reading Gaol.\nIn more recent times the size of the Band has fluctuated but has experienced a revival under the leadership of the current Bandmaster Stuart Hall, who is also a member of the International Staff Band.\nThe Band is possibly now the biggest it has ever been with many young players still entering from the junior sections.\nOver the years Maidenhead Band has contributed many players to the Salvation Army's \"Premier\" Staff Bands.  To date five Maidenhead Bandsmen have been members of Salvation Army Staff Bands; three in the International Staff Band, one in the Melbourne Staff Band and two in the German Staff Band.\n\n\n== Bandmasters ==\n1886 1926 William Thomas\n1926 1930 Hanbury Thomas\n1930 1951 Walter Steventon\n1951 1957 Trevor Steventon\n1957 1964 Walter Steventon (recommenced)\n1964 1973 David Alexander\n1973 1975 George Horrobin\n1975 1977 Bram White\n1977 1978 Fred Betts\n1978 1980 Eric Hallam\n1980 1991 Brian Cooper\n1991 2016 Stuart Hall\n2016 ---- Mark Lazenbury\n\n\n== Mission ==\nAs well as assisting in the weekly religious services; both indoor and in the open-air, the Band has travelled throughout the United Kingdom, playing at Christian services and events.

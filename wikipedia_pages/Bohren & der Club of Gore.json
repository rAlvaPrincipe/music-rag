    "text": "Bohren & der Club of Gore is a German ambient/jazz band from Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was founded in 1992 in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany by Thorsten Benning, Morten Gass, Robin Rodenberg and Reiner Henseleit. Originally, group members started out playing in various hardcore punk bands such as 7 Inch Boots (all members since 1988) and Chronical Diarrhoea (Thorsten Benning and Reiner Henseleit). In 1992 they produced a crossover of jazz and ambient, which they self-described as an \"unholy ambient mixture of slow jazz ballads, Black Sabbath doom and down-tuned Autopsy sounds\". Henseleit left the band in 1996 and was replaced by Christoph Clöser in 1997, replacing the guitar with a saxophone at the same time.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nMorten Gass – electric guitar (1992–1997), vocals (1992–1993), piano, electric organ, synthesizer, Moog synthesizer, mellotron, Fender Rhodes electric piano (1997–present), 8-string bass (2004–present), vocoder (2007–2008), baritone guitar (2013–present), drums (2016–present)\nRobin Rodenberg – bass guitar, double bass (1992–present),  drums (2016–present)\nChristoph Clöser – saxophones (1997–present), piano (2001–present), Fender Rhodes electric piano (2001–present), vibraphone (2004–present),  drums (2016–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nReiner Henseleit – electric guitars (1992–1996)\nThorsten Benning – drums, percussion (1992–2015)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1995 – Gore Motel\n1997 – Midnight Radio\n2000 – Sunset Mission\n2002 – Black Earth\n2005 – Geisterfaust\n2008 – Dolores\n2014 – Piano Nights\n2020 – Patchouli Blue\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n1994 – Bohren & der Club of Gore\n1995 – Schwarzer Sabbat für Dean Martin (split with Wald)\n2009 – Mitleid Lady\n2011 – Beileid\n\n\n=== Demos ===\n1992 – Langspielkassette (as Bohren)\n1993 – Luder, Samba und Tavernen\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n2016 – Bohren for Beginners\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\n2022 – \"Plateau\" on The Others (Lustmord remix/covers album, 2022)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ambient music artists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nBohren & der Club of Gore discography at MusicBrainz\nBohren & der Club of Gore discography at Discogs"

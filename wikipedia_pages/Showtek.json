At that time, Wouter usually produced hard trance under the stage name of Walt, and Sjoerd hardstyle as Duro. They released their first album, Today Is Tomorrow in 2007 under their independent label Dutch Master Works. The album was well received in the Dutch music charts, reaching 68th place, and received a score of 95/100 on Partyflock. In 2009, their second album, Analogue Players in a Digital World, was unveiled at the Amsterdam Dance Event in the Netherlands and circulated by the Central Station Records. The album was well received by the press, which also allows them access to rewards. The duo uses multiple aliases including but not limited to; Dutch Masters, Headliner, Lowrider, Unibass, DJ Duro, Walt, Walt Janssen, Mr. Puta, Boys Will Be Boys and Alan Misael.\n\nIn 2011, the group collaborated on the album Kiss from the Past by Allure, one of the musical projects of Dutch producer Tiësto.

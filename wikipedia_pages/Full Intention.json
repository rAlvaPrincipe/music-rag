    "text": "Full Intention are an English house music duo consisting of Michael Gray and Jon Pearn. They are best known as prolific producers and remixers. They have reworked songs for varied artists such as the Sugababes, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and Frankie Knuckles, among others.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAs the group Hustlers Convention, Jon Pearn and Michael Gray produced their own house tracks and remixed many others, including \"Street life\" by C. J. Lewis and \"Got Myself Together\" by the Bucket Heads. Their first release was The Groovers delight EP in 1992 on Stress Records.\nThey have appeared in the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart three times with their own singles, first under the name Arizona feat. Zeitia with \"Slide on the Rhythm\", which reached number one in 1993, and with \"America (I Love America)\" under the Full Intention name, a number one hit from 1996.  They are also perhaps most well known for their remix of the 1995 club classic \"So In Love\" by Duke.\nIn 1997, they released a song as the act Sex-O-Sonique called \"I thought it was you\", which went to number one in the 1997 UK dance singles chart on 6 December, pushing The Prodigy \"Smack my bitch up\" off the top spot.\nAlthough many of their remixes for other artists have been successful club hits, they did not return to the chart as artists until 2002, when \"I'll Be Waiting\" featuring Shena reached number three. Both members have achieved solo success with Gray releasing singles \"The Weekend\" and \"Borderline\" which were club hits, while Pearn has formed a side project Bodyrox.\nIn 2009, Jon Pearn and Michael Gray released new versions of the singles \"Once In A Lifetime\", \"I Will Follow\", \"Forever\" under the label Full Intention Records. In 2010, they released a single entitled \"America 2010\", remixing their own famous 1996's song. In the late 2010s, the most popular singles of Full Intention were \"Keep Pushing\" (2016) and \"I Miss You\" (2017). In 2018, they released a single with Blaze called \"Be Yourself\".\nFull Intention has also released a number of remixes. They released in 2018 a remix of a David Penn song with Lisa Millett entitled \"Join Us\". They have notably released remixes of classic house tracks like Inner City \"Big Fun\", Frankie Knuckles \"Tears\", or Black Riot \"A Day In The Life\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2006 Connected: 10 Years of Full Intention\n2013 Perspective Mini LP\n\n\n=== Mixed compilations ===\n2002 Ministry of Sound - Defected Sessions\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n1994: Full Length Disco Mixes\n1995: Full Length Disco Mixes 2\n1996 \"America (I Love America)\" (with Nick Clow)\n1996 \"The Return of Full Intention\"\n1996 \"Uptown Downtown\" (with Nick Clow)\n1996 \"You Are Somebody\" (with Nick Clow)\n1997 \"America (I Love America) '97\" (with Nick Clow)\n1997 \"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)\" (with Nick Clow)\n1997 \"Dancin' All Night/In the Streets\"\n1998 \"Everybody Loves the Sunshine\" (with Ernestine Pearce and Xavier Barnett)\n2001 \"Can't Get Over You\" (with Kat Blu)\n2001 \"I'm Satisfied\"\n2001 \"I'll Be Waiting\" (with Shena McSween)\n2002 \"Soul Power\" (with Thea Austin)\n2002 Blue EP\n2002 \"I Need a House Party\"\n2003 \"No One\"\n2003 \"Your Day Is Coming\" (with Shena McSween)\n2003 Red EP\n2003 Green EP\n2004 Orange EP\n2004 \"It's Set to Groove\"\n2004 \"It Hurts Me/Once in a Lifetime\" (with Xavier Barnett)\n2004 Purple EP\n2005 \"La Musique\"\n2005 Anniversary EP\n2006 \"Your Day Is Coming 2006\" (with Shena McSween)\n2006 \"I Believe in You\" (with Lee Muddy Baker)\n2006 \"Soul Power 2006\" (with Thea Austin)\n2009 \"Once in a Lifetime\"\n2009 \"I Will Follow\"\n2010 \"Forever\"\n2010 \"America\n2010 Earth Turns Around EP\n2011 \"Play\"\n2011 \"I'll Be Waiting\"\n2011 \"Signification\" (with Haze)\n2012 \"Jupiter One\"\n2012 \"La Musique\n2013 \"Octavia\"\n2013 \"Icon\"\n2013 \"Madness\"\n2013 \"Sacrifice\"\n2013 \"Float On\"\n2013 \"Perspective\"\n2013 \"First Time Ever\"\n2013 \"All Right\" (feat.

    "text": "Herra Terra is an electro-rock group from Massachusetts, signed to indie label The Mylene Sheath, currently supporting their 2010 release \"Quiet Geist\".\n\n\n== History ==\nHerra Terra was conceived by vocalist John Paul Tonelli and guitarist Gregg Kusumah-Atmadja. The duo released a 3-song EP in 2008 entitled “Organs For The Afterlife” with help from Boston-based musicians (Bad Rabbits, Irepress) and sound engineer, Mike ”Mo” Lapierre (Death Cab for Cutie, Brand New, Drop Kick Murphy's). Unable to find a permanent drummer, the band played as a two piece electronic act in the New England area until 2009, when the band recruited Brad Caetano (Arms & Sleepers, Seneca, AM/PM). Since then, the group has melded together and enhanced their electronic and live elements, adding Adrian Bettencourt Andrade on bass.\nHerra Terra has been an Official Showcasing Artist at the 2011 and 2012 SXSW Festivals.\nHerra Terra has shared the stage with such artists as  The White Mountains, Shiny Toy Guns, Piebald, Damone, Freeze Pop, Green Jelly, Appleseed Cast, Hot Rod Circuit, Chk Chk Chk (!!!), Bad Rabbits, Irepress, Semi Precious Weapons, and many others.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJohn Tonelli - Vocals/Keys\nGregg Kusumah-Atmadja - Guitar/Keys\nAdrian Bettencourt Andrade - Bass/Keys\nShawn Pelkey - Drums\n\n\n== References =="

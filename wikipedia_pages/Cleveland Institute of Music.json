    "text": "The Cleveland Institute of Music (CIM) is a private music conservatory in Cleveland, Ohio. The school was founded in 1920 by a group of supporters led by Martha Bell Sanders and Mary Hutchens Smith, with Ernest Bloch serving as its first director. CIM enrolls 325 students in the conservatory and approximately 1,500 students in the preparatory and continuing education programs. There are typically about 100 openings per year for which 1,000-1,200 prospective students apply.\nMany members of The Cleveland Orchestra serve as faculty at CIM and CIM alumni can be found in major orchestras throughout the United States and the world.\n\n\n== Campus ==\nCIM is located in the University Circle, a four-mile square neighborhood on the east side of Cleveland.\nOpened in 1961, the main building houses teaching studios, practice rooms, recital halls, a music library, and classrooms. The building was expanded in 2007, adding 34,000 square feet of space. This included a new entryway and lobby, an expansion to the music library, a new recital hall, recording/broadcast suites, new practice rooms, and additional administrative offices.\nThrough a cooperative arrangement with nearby Case Western Reserve University, CIM students have full access to many university amenities, and, if accepted to both institutions, can pursue a dual degree both at CIM and Case Western Reserve.\n\n\n== Accreditation ==\nThe Cleveland Institute of Music is accredited by two agencies:\n\nNational Association of Schools of Music\nThe Higher Learning Commission\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Alumni ===\n\nRyan Anthony, trumpeter\nAlan Baer, Principal Tuba, New York Philharmonic\nBenny Bailey, jazz trumpeter\nMike Block, cellist, singer, composer\nHarriet Bolz, composer\nZsolt Bognár, pianist\nJim Brickman, pianist\nNickitas J.

    "text": "Collection d'Arnell~Andréa is a French neoclassical darkwave band founded by Jean-Christophe d'Arnell (main composer, writer, piano/keyboards), Pascal Andréa, and Chloé St Liphard in 1986. Andréa left the band shortly after its founding, before its first performance. However, d'Arnell left Andréa's name in the band name. Their music features prominently keyboards, cello, and Chloé's vocals. The band is known for including a large collection or ensemble of musicians in its live performances and has performed at numerous international music festivals including Germany's Wave-Gotik-Treffen. Many of their albums have focused on late 19th and early 20th century themes.\nWhen the band signed with Prikosnovénie in 2002, the label re-edited and re-released many of the previous New Rose Records albums that had previously been out of print. Signing with Prikosnovénie also resulted in three new albums and a new tour schedule through Europe.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Full length albums and EPs ===\nAutumn's Breath for Anton's Death (1988)\nUn Automne à Loroy New Rose Records (1989), reissued Prikosnovénie (2004)\nAu Val des Roses New Rose Records (1990), reissued Prikosnovénie (2005)\nLes Marronniers New Rose Records (1992)\nVillers-aux-Vents (Février 1916) New Rose Records (1994), reissued Prikosnovénie (2003)\nCirses des Champs Last Call Records (1996)\nColl AGE 1988-1998 Last Call Records 2 CD compilation (1998)\nTristesse des Mânes Prikosnovénie (2002)\nThe Bower of Despair Prikosnovénie (2004)\nExposition, Eaux-Fortes et Méandres Prikosnovénie (2007)\nVernes-Monde Prikosnovénie (2010)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nAnton's Mind Getting Blind on 13 Lively Art (1990)\nIcare (1990)\nUne Attente Douleur on Premonition Lively Art (1992)\nL'Aulne + la Mort on Heavenly Voices Part 2 Hyperium (1993)\nDrifting on Kälte Container Radio Luxor, Sub Terranean (2001)\nWild Trees on Fairy World II Prikosnovénie (2005)\nThe Long Shadow on Fairy World III Prikosnovénie (2007)\nCloser to Unicorn on Fairy World IV Prikosnovénie (2008)\n\n\n== List of band members ==\n\n\n=== Studio and live ===\nPascal Andréa (1986) -- co-founder\nJean-Christophe d'Arnell (1986–present) -- co-founder, piano, keyboards, percussion\nChloé St Liphard (1986–present) -- co-founder, vocals\nCharlotte (1989) -- cello\nThierry Simonnet (1989) -- keyboards\nPeter Rakoto (1989–1990) -- bass guitar\nXavier Gaschignard (1990–present) -- cello\nFranz Torrès-Quévédo (1992–present) -- guitar and bass guitar, also has been a member of O Quam Tristis, Opera Multi Steel, The Three Cold Men, and Thy Violent Vanities\nStephan Kehlsen (1996) -- bass guitar\nCarine Grieg (present) -- keyboards, backing vocals, also a member of Opera Multi Steel, Gantök, and O Quam Tristis\nThibault d'Aboville (2002–present) -- viola, also a member of Gantök and Lili Kunst\nVincent Magnien (2004–present) -- electric guitar\n\n\n== References and notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCollection d'Arnell Andréa website\n(in French) Collection d'Arnell Andréa on the Prikosnovénie label's website.\nDiscography from Discogs"

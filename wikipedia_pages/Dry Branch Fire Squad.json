    "text": "The Dry Branch Fire Squad is an American traditional-style bluegrass band from Virginia, which is fronted by Ron Thomason. The band is known for its showy performances and for Thomason's humorous interludes.  The Dry Branch Fire Squad is the host band of Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival, formerly called the Winterhawk Bluegrass Festival.  The band also hosts the High Mountain Hay Fever festival in Colorado as a fundraiser for a local medical clinic.\n\n\n== History ==\nDry Branch Fire Squad was founded by Thomason, a former member of the Clinch Mountain Boys, in October 1976.  It is named for a small town in Southwest Virginia where Thomason was born. The band has gone through many lineup changes; Thomason has been the one constant, serving as the band's MC, lead singer, and mandolin player.  He also plays banjo and guitar on occasion, and during performances often demonstrates hambone technique which he learned as a child.\n\nIn 1978 the band released a self-titled debut album, and in 1979 they performed at Bill Monroe's Bean Blossom Festival.\nIn 1981 the Dry Branch Fire Squad signed with Rounder Records, and released the first of many recordings with that label.\nIn 1984 the band began hosting the newly organized Winterhawk Bluegrass Festival.\nAt one time banjoist Bill Evans and singer Suzanne Thomas performed and recorded with the band.\nThe band has performed at the annual Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco every year since 2003. \nLong-time members Brian Aldridge and Dan Russell retired at the end of 2015. Former member, Adam McIntosh, rejoined the band playing guitar and mandolin and assuming tenor singing duties. Jeff Byrd also joined replacing Dan Russell on bass.\nIn 2016 band is composed of Adam McIntosh (guitar, mandolin), Tom Boyd (banjo, resophonic guitar), Jeff Byrd (bass), and Ron Thomason (mandolin, banjo, guitar). \nIn 2017 a performance by the band was filmed for inclusion in the film Bluegrass Court Jester.\nThe Dry Branch Fire Squad is a regular at the Gettysburg Bluegrass Festival, and has been the opening act for the Sunday morning gospel set for every single year, twice per summer, since the festival began, totaling 40 years and 80 festivals.

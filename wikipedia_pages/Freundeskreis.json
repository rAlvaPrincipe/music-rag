    "text": "Freundeskreis (meaning \"Circle of Friends\") also known as FK, were a German hip hop group from Stuttgart. They performed songs in German, English, French and Esperanto. The members were Max Herre, Don Philippe and DJ Friction.\nThey were a socially conscious German rap group that released three top twenty albums.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Freundeskreis ===\nFreundeskreis were primarily known for their political lyrics, in which they advocate equality and international understanding. After the much-noticed first album, Quadratur des Kreises (Squaring the Circle), and its hit single \"A-N-N-A\" which peaked at #6 in the German charts, the band released its second album, Esperanto, named after the constructed language Esperanto. The reasoning for the name was that the group wished to show that they believe that hip hop should be the Esperanto of youth.\nIn 1999 and 2000, the band was back in the charts with the singles \"Mit Dir\" (With you; featuring Joy Denalane, who later become Herre's wife) and \"Tabula Rasa Pt. II\".  For the soundtrack of the film 23, Freundeskreis covered the song \"Halt dich an deiner Liebe fest\" (Hold on to your love) written by Rio Reiser, voicing it on Lee \"Scratch\" Perry's police & thieves riddim. Freundeskreis was one of the first bands to take part in the Kolchose, a group of hip hop artists from Stuttgart.\nIn 2001, the band took a break for the members to pursue solo careers, the most active being Herre, who has released a solo album and works as producer for his wife.\nA Freundeskreis greatest hits album was released in July 2007 under the title FK10. After announcing their breakup in summer 2007, Freundeskreis gave their last concert in Stuttgart on 19 September 2007.\n\n\n== Conscious lyrics ==\nFreundeskreis have been considered as a conscious hip-hop artist as their lyrics have educational themes. The song \"Leg Dein Ohr Auf Die Schiene Der Geschichte\" (lay your ear on the tracks of history) asks listeners to look beyond what they were taught in history lessons and learn the real lessons of history.\nExcerpts from \"Leg Dein Ohr Auf Die Schiene Der Geschichte\"\"\n\nviele Menschen schrecken zurück wenn sie \"Geschichte\" hör'n\nGeschichte...\nvier langweilige Stunden pro Woche in der Schule\n(...)\nneunzehnhundertdreiundsiebzig Geburtsjahr wichtig für mich\nals auch geschichtlich denn da wurd' klar dass die C.I.A. 'ne Hure war\nRough translation:\n\nmany people step away when they hear \"history\"\nHistory...\nFour boring lessons in school a week \n(...)\nnineteenseventythree, birth year, important for me,\nas well as historically, because then it became clear that the CIA was a whore\nThe rest of the song takes into account other historical events important to his year of birth, as well as other events throughout his childhood which are often overlooked. The chorus implores,\n\nyou're just a part of it so get to the heart of it\n'cause if you don't go you won't know\nyou're just a part of it get to the heart of it\n'cause if you don't go you never ever never ever gonna know\n\n\n=== FK Allstars ===\nFK Allstars was a collaboration of several hip hop, soul, and reggae artists, including Max Herre, Sekou Neblett, Afrob, Brooke Russell, Joy Denalane and Gentleman. Despite the FK Allstars band having its roots in hip hop, there are elements of reggae, soul, funk and jazz blended in.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nGerman hip hop\nEsperanto music\nIch Zwerg\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFour Music label Archived 2011-09-28 at the Wayback Machine (German)\nFreundeskreis homepage (German)"

    "text": "AOA (Korean: 에이오에이; an acronym for Ace of Angels) is a South Korean girl group formed by FNC Entertainment. The original 2012 eight-member line-up included: Choa, Jimin, Yuna, Youkyung, Hyejeong, Mina, Seolhyun, and Dohwa. The group has been inactive since 2019, following a series of scandals within the group's lineup and the members' departures from FNC.\nAOA began their career simultaneously promoting as a dance group and band, and officially debuted in July 2012 with the release of the single album Angel's Story. In early 2013, the band unit AOA Black released their official single titled \"MOYA\" to moderate success. They released their first EP in June 2014, and that year they also debuted in Japan under Universal Music Japan. The group found nationwide success in 2014 after a series of hit songs that established them as one of the leading girl groups of their era. \"Heart Attack\" debuted at the top of several charts after its release, became one of the most downloaded songs of 2015, and became one of the longest charting singles on Melon's top 100 chart.\nFollowing a series of consistent success, AOA debuted a second promotional unit, AOA Cream, in 2016. The group would later release their first Korean language studio album in January 2017, and a few months later, held their first headlining Korean concert \"Ace Of Angels\" at Olympic Hall in Seoul. Among the groups' biggest hits are \"Miniskirt\", \"Short Hair\", \"Like a Cat\", \"Heart Attack\", \"Give Me the Love\", \"Good Luck\", \"Excuse Me\", and \"Bingle Bangle\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2012–2013: Formation and debut ===\n\nThe eight members were introduced individually through teaser photos from July 16 to 23 (in order: Seolhyun, Choa, Hyejeong, Dohwa, Yuna, Mina, Jimin, & Youkyung).\nAOA were introduced with a 'transformer' concept, which the group described meant they would promote alternately as a band with various members playing instruments and as a dance group.

The song and music video for their debut title track \"Elvis\" was released on July 30. The group began promotions with their debut stage on August 9 on M Countdown and then Music Bank on August 10 to minimal success.\nTwo months after their debut, FNC confirmed that the group would be making a comeback with a second single album \"Wanna Be\" on October 10.

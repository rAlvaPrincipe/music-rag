    "text": "Prettier Than Pink was an all-female Filipino pop rock group. The band went professional in 1991 with original members- Lei Bautista (lead vocalist), Annie Trillo (bass guitars), Gretchen Gregorio (keyboards), and Vanessa Garcia (drummer). Many music enthusiasts consider the group unique among girl groups because the members played their own instruments. Originally called Pretty and Pink, the band started playing 1960s music at Rock Ma Jazz (a bar owned by RJ Jacinto) and eventually played 1980s music from the Go-Go's, the Bangles, the B-52s, etc. at different bars such as Par Avion, Kalye, Fat Tuesdays, and Cosmo.\nIn 1995 a self-produced demo garnered interest from various record labels and the group changed its name to Prettier Than Pink. Neo Records (now VIVA Records) eventually signed them up. After five months, an eponymous debut album went Gold. The single \"Cool Ka Lang,\" written and composed by the band's lead singer and founding member Lei Bautista, reached no. 1 on the OPM charts.\nBy 1997, Prettier Than Pink had undergone a line-up transformation, with Bautista remaining as the group's leader. Their second album, UnPink, took a less commercial turn; but the release received regional airplay with \"Baby\". In 1998, Lei Bautista was nominated for an Awit award for \"Baby.\"\nBautista left for the U.S. shortly thereafter, reviving Prettier Than Pink in America as a new wave-styled group. In 2005, Prettier Than Pink started recording their U.S. debut for the Sutton Records label.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Final line-up ===\nLei Bautista - lead vocals/guitar\nPamela Aquino - lead guitar\nMelanie Cariker - bass\nAmy Behrman - keyboards/vocals\nJasmin Guevara - drums\n\n\n=== Former line-up ===\nGretchen Gregorio - keyboards\nAnne Trillo - bass\nVanessa Garcia - drums\nRozylyn Torres - lead guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\nPrettier in Pink (1995, VIVA Records)\nUn-Pink (1997, VIVA Records)\nChop Suey (2005, Sutton Records)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Myspace"

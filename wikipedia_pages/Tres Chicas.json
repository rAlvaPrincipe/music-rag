    "text": "Tres Chicas are an alternative country group from Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\n\n== History ==\nBlakey and Cary met in 1997 when Glory Fountain shared a bill with Whiskeytown. Blakey met Lamm when she attended a Hazeldine show in Chapel Hill, and soon all three were friends.\nThey first began singing together in 1999; their first performance was an impromptu singalong at an Alejandro Escovedo show in a Raleigh bar. Their name was bestowed upon them by the owner of the bar after the performance.\nThey occasionally performed live, and recorded some of their material more for historical interest than with the intent of releasing it. Producer Chris Stamey heard the tapes and asked the group to release a full album; the result was Sweetwater, their 2004 debut for Yep Roc.\nThe group toured the U.S. and Europe in 2005. Their second album Bloom, Red & The Ordinary Girl was released in March 2006. The album was recorded in London with producers Neil Brockbank (Nick Lowe, Bryan Ferry, Tanita Tikaram) and Robert Trehern (Paul McCartney, Van Morrison, Mark Knopfler), and featured appearances by Nick Lowe, Geraint Watkins, and Bill Kirchen.\n\n\n== Members ==\nLynn Blakey (ex-Glory Fountain, Let's Active, Oh OK)\nCaitlin Cary (ex-Whiskeytown)\nTonya Lamm (ex-Hazeldine)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2004: Sweetwater (Yep Roc)\n2006: Bloom, Red & the Ordinary Girl (Yep Roc)\n\n\n=== Appeared on ===\n2001: Alejandro Escovedo – A Man Under The Influence (Bloodshot)\n2001: Greg Hawks & The Tremblers – Fool's Paradise (Yep Roc)\n2008: Monty Warren – Trailer Park Angel (Doublenaught)\n\n\n=== Primary Contributor on ===\n2004: Various Artists – Por Vida: A Tribute To The Songs Of Alejandro Escovedo (Cooking Vinyl) – track 14, \"Rhapsody\"\n2007: Various Artists – Musicians For Minneapolis (Electro-Voice) – track 3–13, \"Lloyd's Mom\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTresChicas.org\nTres Chicas discography at Discogs"

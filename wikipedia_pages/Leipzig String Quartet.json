    "text": "The Leipzig String Quartet (in German: Leipziger Streichquartett) is a German string quartet established in 1988. The ensemble was also part of the 'Ensemble Avangarde' with the pianist Steffen Schleiermacher from Leipzig.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Quartet was founded in 1988 as the \"New Leipzig String Quartet\". It kept this name until 1995. Three of the members were at the time at the first desks in the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra until 1993, when they finally decided to devote themselves exclusively to chamber music.\nThey studied with Gerhard Bosse in Leipzig, former member and concertmaster of the Gewandhaus Quartet (1955–1977), with the Amadeus Quartet in London and Cologne, with violist Hatto Beyerle in Hanover and with Walter Levin, founding member and concertmaster of the LaSalle Quartet.\nSince November 1991, the quartet has been developing its own concert series, \"Pro Quatuor\" in Leipzig. As part of the 'Ensemble Avangarde', the quartet is the co-founder of the 'musica nova' ensemble of the Leipzig Gewandhaus.\nIn 1996, the Leipzig Quartet launched the 'Beethoven String Quartet Cycle as a sign of European friendship', which has brought together more than fifteen cities in Europe. The nine discs of the first complete recording of all Franz Schubert's string quartets is completed in 1997. In 2002, the ensemble is in residence at the Madrid Teatro Real.\nThe Leipzig Quartet performed at the Gewandhaus from 1993 to 2000, in the cycle all the great quartets of Viennese Classicism and the Second Viennese School. In 1996 the members of the ensemble performed the German premiere of \"À trois\" for string trio and orchestra by Alfred Schnittke.\nAn intense concert activity takes them throughout Europe, North and South America, Australia, Japan, Israel, Africa and Asia. To date, the ensemble has visited more than 60 countries.

    "text": "Levinhurst is an English electronic band formed by keyboardist/drummer Lol Tolhurst, a founding member of the Cure, and his wife Cindy Levinson on vocals. The band's name is a portmanteau of their surnames. To date, Levinhurst has released three studio albums.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 2002, with Tolhurst and Levinson assisted by guitarist/keyboardist Dayton Borders. Their debut album, Perfect Life, was released in 2004. This was followed in 2006 by an EP called The Grey, which featured a cover of the early Cure song \"All Cats Are Grey\". Their second full-length album, House by the Sea, was released in 2007. By this point, guitarist/bassist Eric Bradley had joined the band.\nIn 2009, Levinhurst was joined by another former member of the Cure, Michael Dempsey, on bass and keyboards. This lineup released the album Blue Star in 2009, with a guest appearance by Tolhurst and Levinson's then 16 year-old son Gray Tolhurst on guitar.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nCindy Levinson - vocals (2002–present)\nLol Tolhurst - drums, synthesizer, keyboards (2002–present)\nEric Bradley - guitar, bass, backing vocals (2007–present)\nMichael Dempsey - bass, keyboards, guitar, string arrangements (2009–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nDayton Borders - guitar, keyboards (2002–2005)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nPerfect Life (2004)\nHouse by the Sea (2007)\nBlue Star (2009)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nThe Grey (2006)\nSomewhere, Nothing Is Everything (2014)\n\n\n== References =="

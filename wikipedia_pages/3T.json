    "text": "3T is an American R&B/pop music trio featuring the three sons of Tito Jackson (from the Jackson 5) and Delores \"Dee Dee\" Jackson, from whom they inherit their Dominican ancestry. The band members include, from eldest, Tariano Adaryll Jackson II (\"Taj\") (born August 4, 1973), Taryll Adren Jackson (born August 8, 1975) and Tito Joe Jackson (\"TJ\") (born July 16, 1978). Their late uncle Michael Jackson mentored the trio, and signed them to his label MJJ Music.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Brotherhood (1995–1997) ===\n3T released their debut album Brotherhood in 1995. The album sold approximately three million copies worldwide. The group achieved an international hit with their debut single \"Anything\". 3T released several hit singles in Europe, including \"24/7\", \"Why\" (a duet with their uncle Michael Jackson), \"I Need You\" (with a brief appearance by Michael), \"Tease Me\" and \"Gotta Be You\". In 1996, they were ranked second behind the Spice Girls, as the biggest-selling group in Europe. 3T have also written and produced songs for soundtracks to films such as; The Jacksons: An American Dream, Free Willy, Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home, Men in Black and Trippin'. In early 1997, they went on a hugely successful European tour with their album Brotherhood, which included all of the songs from the album, as well as a Jackson 5 tribute (featuring Tito 'Poppa T'), and a surprise performance of the Oasis hit \"Wonderwall\".\n3T completed an album after the release of Brotherhood, with over 20 songs being recorded and 12 planned to be included on the final tracklist. The album was never released by Sony due to a strained relationship with Michael Jackson (MJJ Music), and is considered by many fans to be The Lost Album.\n\n\n=== Identity (2003–2005) ===\nTaryll and T. J. have written and produced tracks for their aunt Janet Jackson as well as for Lindsay Lohan and Bruno Mars. After signing with the French label TF1/NRJ in 2003, 3T continued to perform in France, the Netherlands and Belgium. The group signed with the Dutch label Digidance in 2004 for Dutch releases, appearances, and performances. The album titled Identity was released on March 23, 2004. Two singles were released: \"Stuck On You\" (a cover of the Lionel Richie song) was released in 2003 in France and Belgium and in 2004 in the Netherlands, and \"Sex Appeal\" in 2004.

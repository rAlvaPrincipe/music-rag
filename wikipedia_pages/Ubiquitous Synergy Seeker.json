    "text": "USS (Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker) was a Canadian alternative rock musical duo from Toronto. The band was composed of vocalist and guitarist Ashley Buchholz (aka Ash Boo-Schultz) and turntablist/hype man  Jason \"Human Kebab\" Parsons.\nThe band's sound is a mixture of drum and bass beats, grunge-like guitar riffs, and 2-step rhythms. \"We like to call what we do the campfire after-party\", Ash Buchholz has said; \"It's like you're at Nirvana Unplugged but there's a drum and bass party and glow sticks all around you.\" The duo announced their split in 2021 and performed their final show on June 11, 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and first release: 2004–2008 ===\nUSS hails from the Greater Toronto Area, Buchholz being from the city of Markham and Parsons from the adjacent town of Stouffville. They met in 2004 while stocking the beer fridge and discussing music when they worked at a golf course. The pair hit it off instantly. A few months later, Buchholz's sister was looking for someone to DJ at her upcoming wedding and Parsons was suggested for the job. According to Buchholz, \"It was love at first scratch\", and he later moved into Parsons' parents' basement to begin experimenting musically.\nThe band's name came about when Buchholz sketched out a map of exactly who he wanted to be in life. At the top, he wrote, \"Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker\". Although this title was to become the band's moniker, the duo says that the name is for everyone: \"It's singular — it's the title of a characteristic, not the title of two guys\", Buchholz said.\nBy July 2008, the two began to perform live, and they released their first independent EP, Welding the C:/ (pronounced \"Welding the C Drive\") later that same month. The band then parted ways to pursue different avenues; Parsons travelled to Alberta to work on an oil pipeline and Buchholz went to the US on a pilgrimage. A friend of Parsons' later called him to say that Toronto radio station 102.1 The Edge had begun playing their first single, \"Hollowpoint Sniper Hyperbole\". The duo then returned to Toronto to shoot a video for the song, which was later added to the MuchMusic channel.\n\n\n=== Questamation: 2009–2011 ===\nIn March 2009, USS released their first full-length album, Questamation, through their independent label, Smashing World Records.  For the recording, the duo teamed up with Matthew Von Wagner (Crystal Castles, Alpha Galates) for production and engineering, while Chris Davies and Charles Topping 'aided musically'. Music engineer Bob Ludwig was recruited to master the original album in Portland, Maine. James Black of Finger Eleven is featured playing guitar on \"P.S. I Can Change\".\nOn March 14, they won the award for Favourite Group/Duo at the CMW Indie Awards in Toronto. During their performance, the duo lit up the stage with a high-energy set, complete with handstands and full-size cardboard cutouts of Barack Obama and Albert Einstein.\nIn November, they supported illScarlett on the Canadian leg of their 1UP! Tour.\nShortly after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, various musicians from the Toronto area came together on February 2, 2010, at The Sound Academy, for the 102.1 The Edge-sponsored Toronto Plays For Haiti benefit. USS headlined the event, alongside Choclair, The Salads, Die Mannequin, The Trews, and Moneen. That evening, on impulse, Human Kebab played DJ to Canadian hip hop artist Maestro Fresh Wes.\nIn March and April, the band embarked on their Highway to Health tour. USS travelled from Barrie to British Columbia with The Stables, a Durham Region band along for the ride as direct support.\nUSS brought home their second consecutive COCA Award (Canadian Organization of Campus Activities) for Emerging Artist, (Winner of Emerging Artist Award 2009/2010), on June 25, 2010.\nIn September, Smirnoff launched their \"Be There\" campaign for the Nightlife Exchange Project. The countries that participated were Canada, United States, the UK, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, India, Ireland, Lebanon, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, and Venezuela. USS were named as the Canadian curators, to deliver Canadian nightlife to India. In October, the duo flew to Mumbai for the campaign.\nIn December, USS released the track \"Mavericks\", a collaboration with Canadian fiddler Ashley MachIsaac. The single's lyrics reference surfer Jeff Clark.\nUSS earned two spots on 102.1 The Edge's top songs of 2010, with \"Anti-Venom\" at No. 26 and \"3 Purple Butterflies\" at No. 74.\nThe 2011 soundtrack to Major League Baseball 2K11 (MLB 2K11), released by 2K Sports, single \"Anti-Venom\" from  Questamation. It was also on the Nintendo Wii and 3DS version soundtrack to Need for Speed: The Run, released by EA Black Box and Firebrand Games in November 2011.\n\n\n=== Approved: 2011–2012 ===\nUSS released their next single, \"N/A OK\" on February 14, 2011.\nIn an interview with Eye Weekly, Parsons elaborated on what the duo was working on:\n\nIt's amazing. We're working with Tawgs Salter, who's done records with Lights, The Midway State, and Josh Groban, and he's been helping us define what the new USS is, from a songwriting perspective. We're free to be quirky, acoustic, singer-songwriter, electronic turntable-based music, but in a bigger sounding format that has global aspirations. We've returned more to the minimal that we showed on our first EP, Welding The C:/, but we're doing it with the right producer, to make it sound as big and powerful as we can be. At the start of the year we did a song with Ashley MacIsaac, and we followed that with what's hopefully going to become our new EP.\n\nApproved, the band's second EP, was released digitally worldwide on May 3, 2011, the day of the release party at Toronto's MOD Club and the kickoff date for the USS Approved Spring/Summer Cross-Canada tour. The physical copy was exclusively released in Canada at the band's shows or on their official website. In an interview with Niagara Music Scene, Buchholz explained the EP's title: Approved, because it seems like everyone has issues of self-worth. YOU'RE ALL GOOD ENOUGH! Most of life is just overcompensation for not feeling like you are good enough. APPROVED!\nBy the end of summer 2011, the second single from Approved—\"Yo Hello Hooray (Everyday)\"—had begun receiving regular rotation on Canadian rock radio stations. \"Yo Hello Hooray (Everyday)\" is the band's highest-charting rock radio single in Canada to date.\n\"N/A OK\" was nominated in the Rock category at the 2012 Canadian Radio Music Awards.\nThe third single from Approved, \"Damini\", charted on the hits Canadian rock radio chart.\n\n\n=== Advanced Basics: 2013–2015 ===\nOn June 4, 2013, USS released \"This Is the Best\", the first single from their third EP, Advanced Basics.\nThe band flew to London to perform in Trafalgar Square for Canada Day International alongside Canadian rock icons The Tragically Hip plus Jann Arden, The Sheepdogs, and  Arkells.\nUSS released Advanced Basics in Canada on February 11, 2014.

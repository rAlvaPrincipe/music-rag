    "text": "KONK was an American band formed in 1980 in New York City and active until 1988 that emerged during a period marked by the post-punk/new wave and disco scenes which were prevalent at the time. KONK won the attention of both scenes by playing a hybrid of the two musical styles which involved the blending of a new wave attitude with the carefree nature of disco's dance crowd. KONK's musical influences ranged from Afrobeat, jazz and funk to hip hop. Given these influence KONK's style is noted as being highly percussive, and containing simple, yet strong, backing bass lines. As part of New York’s post-punk dance scene they regularly played alongside groups such as Liquid Liquid, Bush Tetras, ESG, the Peech Boys and the Lounge Lizards. They are included in a book by David Byrne and others on the New York post-punk scene.\n\n\n== Members ==\nKONK was formed by avant-garde jazz personality Dana Vlcek, and had among its many members:\n\nRichard Edson on drums, who also played drums on the first Sonic Youth record and had acting roles in films including Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing, and Jim Jarmusch's Stranger Than Paradise.\nAngel Quinones on congas, who later played for Jimmy Buffett.\nShannon Dawson on the trumpet, who also was an early associate of Jean-Michel Basquiat in the band Gray, and who did some of the band's promo poster art work.

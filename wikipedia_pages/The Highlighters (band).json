    "text": "The Highlighters was a funk band from the U.S. city of Indianapolis with minor hits in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Highlighters was originally formed in 1963 by jazz musicians at Crispus Attucks High School in Indianapolis, Indiana. After three of the band members were drafted to fight in the Vietnam War, the band reorganized as a funk band with new members. Their songs Poppin Popcorn and The Funky 16 Corners were regional hits in Indiana.\nWhen the band's original drummer, James \"Porkchop\" Edwards, returned from Vietnam, he sought to rejoin. Conflict over this led to the band dissolving in 1971. Many of the band's members would continue in the music industry, like Dewayne \"Funky Buzzard\" Garvin, who would perform as a drummer for artists like Marvin Gaye. In 2010, trumpeter Clifford Ratliff was inducted into the Indianapolis Jazz Hall of Fame.\nThe band's songs were re-issued in the 1990s, and became popular with collectors. Funky 16 Corners was included on a 2001 compilation album of the same name. It was also featured on the soundtrack of the action movie Hit and Run (2012).\n\n\n== References =="

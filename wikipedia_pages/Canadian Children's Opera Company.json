    "text": "The Canadian Children's Opera Company (formerly the Canadian Children's Opera Chorus, CCOC) is a large choral group based in Toronto.  The company consists of five divisions of approximately 240 boys and girls aged 6 to 19.  The Principal Chorus has about 50 choristers, and they participate as the children's chorus in productions by the Canadian Opera Company (COC).  The current music director is Teri Dunn.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe CCOC was founded in 1968 by Ruby Mercer and Lloyd Bradshaw.\nIn July 2011, during its European tour, the chorus competed in the Summa Cum Laude International Youth Music Festival in Vienna for the first time, and placed 2nd in the treble category. In the summer of 2017, the CCOC toured Prague, Krakow and Budapest with their production of Brundibar by Hans Krasa. The choir visited and performed at the concentration camp where the opera was performed over 50 times.\nOn October 26, 2017, the CCOC celebrated their 50th anniversary with a concert titled \"Ruby's Gold\" at the Four Seasons Centre. The evening was hosted by tenor Ben Heppner and featured many Canadian singers including Krisztina Szabó, Simone Osborne, Measha Brueggergosman and Andrew Haji, many of whom are CCOC alumni.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe company's repertoire consists of a mix of contemporary and traditional pieces. The group explores various genres of music including folk, opera, music theatre, gospel, and jazz.\nThe CCOC performs often; in addition to COC productions, they perform with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Soundstreams Canada, the Hannaford Street Silver Band, Art of Time Ensemble, and The Tenors as well as in their own shows.\nThe CCOC has toured across Europe and Canada and continues to expand its repertoire of music in various languages including English, French, Italian, Serbian, Russian, Mandarin, Hungarian, German, as well as several African languages.\nEvery few years, the CCOC goes on a tour across Europe with choristers from the CCOC's Principal and Youth Choruses.

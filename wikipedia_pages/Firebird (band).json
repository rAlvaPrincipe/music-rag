    "text": "Firebird were a British blues-rock power trio founded by Bill Steer in 1999. The music style, reminiscent of 1960s rock bands such as Cream, is a radical departure from Steer's previous work with grindcore pioneers Napalm Death and Carcass.\n\n\n== History ==\nFirebird came together in 1999, when Steer teamed up with Cathedral bassist Leo Smee and Spiritual Beggars drummer Ludwig Witt. This line-up recorded both Firebird (2000) and Deluxe (2001). Both bassist and drummer departed due to commitments with their primary bands before a 2001 European tour, that saw Steer teaming up with Blind Dog bassist Tobias Nilsson and Quill drummer George Atlagic. In 2002 Steer announced yet another line-up consisting of drummer Atlagic and Quill and Spiritual Beggars bassist Roger Nilsson. This line-up recorded 2003's No. 3. Since then many line-up changes occurred but significantly Steer reunited with Witt on 2006's Hot Wings and have remained the core of the line up ever since recording two more albums, 2009's Grand Union and 2010's Double Diamond.\nEventually the band on 3 April 2012, announced that they had disbanded. The band wrote on its official Facebook page:\n\nAs some of you are probably already aware, at the end of 2011 Firebird decided to call it a day. The reasons are too numerous to go into here. But we would like to thank everyone, who helped the band over the years, and the friends we made up and down the country, as well as the many lovely people we met overseas.

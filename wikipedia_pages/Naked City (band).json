    "text": "Naked City was an avant-garde music group led by saxophonist and composer John Zorn. Active primarily in New York City from 1988 to 1993, Naked City was initiated by Zorn as a \"composition workshop\" to test the limits of composition (and improvisation) in a traditional rock band lineup. Their music incorporated elements of jazz, surf, progressive rock, classical, heavy metal, grindcore, country, punk rock, and other genres.\n\n\n== History ==\nNamed after a 1945 book of graphic black and white photographs by Weegee, the band performed an aggressive mix of \"soundtrack themes, bluesy hard bop, speedy hardcore rock, squealing free jazz [and] metallic funk\". In Naked City's characteristic early style, songs were often performed at astonishingly fast tempos, drawing on thrash metal and hardcore punk's emphasis on extreme speed. Many songs were quite brief, and typically switched musical genres every few measures. One critic described the band's music as \"jump-cutting micro-collages of hardcore, country, sleazy jazz, covers of John Barry and Ornette Coleman, brief abstract tussles—a whole city crammed into two or three minute bursts\". This fast-change tendency was inspired in part by Carl Stalling—a Zorn favorite—who wrote music for many Warner Bros. cartoons, that featured frequent shifts in tempo, theme and style.\nNaked City's first album was distributed under Zorn's name by Nonesuch Records and featured a Weegee photograph of a dead gangster on its cover, along with macabre illustrations by Maruo Suehiro. Zorn stated that \"Naked City started with rhythm and blues/Spillane type things then went into this hard-core thing ... because I was living in Japan and experiencing a lot of alienation and rejection ... My interest in hard-core also spurred the urge to write shorter and shorter pieces.\" There was disagreement between Zorn and the label over cover art on subsequent albums. Zorn wanted to use explicit S&M pictures, images from 19th century medical archives, and execution photographs, most notoriously of a Leng Tch'e victim; Nonesuch refused. Zorn ended his relationship with the label, releasing subsequent Naked City albums on Shimmy Disc and his own Avant and Tzadik labels. \nThe album Torture Garden (1989) featured \"hardcore miniatures\", intense brief compositions often lasting less than a minute. Some of these tracks had also featured on the band's debut and others would resurface on the band's next full-length release, Grand Guignol (1992), which also included performances of works by Claude Debussy, Alexander Scriabin, Orlande de Lassus, Charles Ives, and Olivier Messiaen.\nThe band's third album, Heretic (1992), featured more of these short improvisations produced for the soundtrack of an underground S/M film Jeux des Dames Cruelles. The band released Leng Tch'e, in 1992 featuring a single composition which lasted just over half an hour. Radio, released in 1993, was the first Naked City album composed solely by Zorn, and featured tracks crediting a wide range of musical influences.\nThe final recording from the band, Absinthe (1993), featured a blend of ambient noise-styled compositions with tracks titled after the works of Paul Verlaine, Charles Baudelaire and other figures in the fin de siècle Decadent movement, and a dedication to Olivier Messiaen.\nZorn discontinued Naked City when he felt \"the need to write music for other ensembles, in other contexts, with new ideas\". A brief 15th anniversary reunion occurred in 2003 for two shows in Amsterdam and Warsaw respectively.\n\n\n== Cinematic connections ==\nThe group covered numerous film soundtrack cuts, including work by Georges Delerue. Heretic was intended as the soundtrack for a film starring Karen Finley.\nThe tracks \"Bonehead\" and \"Hellraiser\", from Torture Garden, are featured in the opening sequence of Michael Haneke's film Funny Games and its 2007 remake.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nJohn Zorn – alto saxophone\nBill Frisell – electric guitar\nFred Frith – bass guitar\nWayne Horvitz – keyboards\nJoey Baron – drums\nYamatsuka Eye – vocals\nLive members\nMike Patton – vocals (1991 and 2003)\nCyro Baptista – percussion (1989)\nCarol Emanuel – harp (1989)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nNaked City (1990)\nGrand Guignol (1992)\nHeretic (1992)\nLeng Tch'e (1992)\nRadio (1993)\nAbsinthe (1993)\nLive albums\n\nNaked City Live, Vol. 1: The Knitting Factory 1989 (2002)\nCompilation albums\n\nTorture Garden (contains the \"hardcore miniatures\" that were also released on the albums Naked City and Grand Guignol) (1990)\nBlack Box (contains the albums Torture Garden and Leng Tch'e, originally released only in Japan) (1996)\nNaked City: The Complete Studio Recordings (Box Set) (2005)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNaked City index\nNaked City discography at MusicBrainz"

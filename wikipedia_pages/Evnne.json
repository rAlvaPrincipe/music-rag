    "text": "Evnne (Korean: 이븐; RR: Ibeun; stylized in all caps) is a South Korean boy band formed by Jellyfish Entertainment. The group consists of seven members: Keita, Park Han-bin, Lee Jeong-hyeon, Ji Yun-seo, Yoo Seung-eon, Mun Jung-hyun, and Park Ji-hoo. They debuted on September 19, 2023, with the extended play (EP) Target: Me.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut, participation in Boys Planet, and formation ===\n\nIn 2023, Mnet aired the reality competition show Boys Planet, which saw 98 contestants from various backgrounds compete to become part of a temporary boy band under WakeOne. At the show's conclusion, nine contestants were selected to form the lineup of Zerobaseone, which debuted on July 10. Four members of Evnne made it to the Top 18 of the show's finale but were unable to debut in the final lineup, which included Park Han-bin, Keita, Lee Jeong-hyeon, and Yoo Seung-eon, who placed 11th, 12th, 15th, and 16th, respectively. The remaining members who would make up the group are Mun Jung-hyun, Park Ji-hoo, and Ji Yun-seo who were eliminated in the second round of the show, placing 29th, 33rd, and 41st, respectively.\nLater, on August 3, Jellyfish Entertainment announced that seven eliminated contestants from the show, following careful discussions between the trainees' companies —WakeOne, Yuehua Entertainment, and Rain Company— would debut under the agency in the second half of 2023 as the boy band BLIT. The agency explained that the group's name is an acronym for \"Boldly Leaping into Tomorrow\", adding that the group promises to \"break boundaries as artists\". Following concerns regarding the potential misinterpretations of the group's name, Jellyfish renamed the group to \"Evnne\" following consultations with the members. The agency explained that the name was derived from combining \"unusual words\" that mean \"Evening's Newest Etoiles\", which represents a \"new rising star in the night sky\".\nThe group's lineup includes several members with prior experience in the entertainment industry ahead of their participation on Boys Planet. In 2021, Keita debuted as part of the boy band Ciipher under Rain Company, while Park Han-bin competed on SBS TV's Loud before joining WakeOne as a trainee.\n\n\n=== 2023–present: Debut with Target: Me, Un: Seen and Ride or Die ===\nOn August 16, 2023, it was announced that Evnne would make their debut on September 19, with the EP Target: Me and its lead single \"Trouble\". The group released their second EP Un: Seen on January 22, 2024. The EP's lead single \"Ugly\" won the group's first music show win on Show Champion on January 31. Evnne released their third EP Ride or Die on June 17, 2024 with the lead single \"Badder Love\". On September 7, 2024, at the 7th The Fact Music Awards, Evnne won the Global Hot Trend Award, together with another group, N.SSign. \n\n\n== Members ==\nKeita Terazono (佳汰; 케이타) – leader\nPark Han-bin (박한빈)\nLee Jeong-hyeon (이정현)\nYoo Seung-eon (유승언)\nJi Yun-seo (지윤서)\nMun Jung-hyun (문정현)\nPark Ji-hoo (박지후)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== Korean singles ====\n\n\n==== Japanese singles ====\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

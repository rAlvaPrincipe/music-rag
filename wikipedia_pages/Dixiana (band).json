    "text": "Dixiana was an American country music band. Founded in 1986, the band was composed of five members: brothers Mark (bass guitar, vocals) and Phil Lister (guitar, vocals), Randall Griffith (keyboards), Colonel Shuford (drums), and Cindy Murphy (lead vocals).\nSigned to Epic Records in 1992, they released their self-titled debut album that year. It produced three singles, two of which charted on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts. The album received a Câˆ’ rating from Entertainment Weekly, who described it as \"generic country-pop\" but highlighted lead vocalist Murphy as a \"strong suit\". A fourth single, \"Now You're Talkin'\", was released in 1993. Joseph Stanley of Cash Box praised it as a \"fresh and fun cut\".\nMark and Phil Lister have since co-founded a recording studio called Dixiana Music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Dixiana ===\n\n\n==== The Band ====\n\n\n==== Additional Musicians ====\n\n\n==== Production ====\n\nTrack information and credits verified from the album's liner notes.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References =="

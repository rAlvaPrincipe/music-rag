On the subject of the collaboration, Hook said \"I was delighted to be asked by autoKratz and knowing their music, I understand why. The song was great before I even touched it. \"I just put the icing on the cake, so it was a real pleasure.\"\nIn late 2011, the autoKratz track \"Stay The Same\" featured in the motion picture 50/50 with Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.\nWith the growing success of their label Bad Life, the latter part of 2011 saw autoKratz return to releasing more club-centric tracks and adopting a sound which combined elements of electro and techno.

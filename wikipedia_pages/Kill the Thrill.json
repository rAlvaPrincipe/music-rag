    "text": "Kill the Thrill is a French industrial rock/metal band formed in Marseille in 1989. The band consists of Nicolas Dick (lead vocals, guitar, programming), Marylin Tognolli (bass, programming, vocals), and Frédéric De Benedetti (guitar, vocals).\nGenerally associated with the industrial music movement, the band has dabbled with a variety of sounds during its career, ranging from alternative rock, to ambient goth, to darker new wave, and heavy metal. The band's musical eclecticism led to a cult following among its selective audience. The band has cited Killing Joke, Godflesh, Swans and The Young Gods as influences. During its career, Kill the Thrill has also released records sporadically, including Dig (1993), Low (1996), 203 Barriers (2003), and Tellurique (2005). Their third album, 203 Barriers, featured contributions from Michael Gira of Swans. The band's first studio album in 19 years, Autophagie, is due on January 26, 2024.\nKill the Thrill also performed as a supporting act for bands such as Killing Joke, The Young Gods, Einstürzende Neubauten and Treponem Pal.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\n\nNicolas Dick – lead vocals, guitar, programming\nMarylin Tognolli – bass, programming, vocals\nFrédéric De Benedetti – guitar, vocals\nPast members\n\nThierry Ringelstein – guitar\nPatrick Allard – guitar\nERikm – guitar\nLeon – guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nDig (1993)\nLow (1996)\n203 Barriers (2003)\nTellurique (2005)\nAutophagie (2024)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nPit (1993)\n\n\n=== Splits ===\nLes Enfants du Mistral (1990, E.P.)

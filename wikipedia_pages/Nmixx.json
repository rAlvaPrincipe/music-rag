    "text": "Nmixx (Korean: 엔믹스; RR: Enmikseu; MR: Enmiksŭ, stylized in all caps) is a South Korean girl group formed by SQU4D, a sub-label of JYP Entertainment. The group is composed of six  members: Lily, Haewon, Sullyoon, Bae, Jiwoo, and Kyujin. Originally a seven-piece group, Jinni departed from the lineup on December 9, 2022, for personal reasons. They debuted on February 22, 2022, with the single album Ad Mare.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Nmixx combines the letter \"N\", which stands for \"now\", \"new\", \"next\", and the unknown \"n\", and the word \"mix\", which symbolizes combination and diversity, altogether meaning \"the best combination for a new era\".\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2021–2022: Debut and Jinni's departure ===\n\nOn July 9, 2021, JYP Entertainment announced a new girl group would be debuting in February 2022, its first since Itzy in 2019. From July 16 to 25, JYP Entertainment made pre-orders available for a limited edition of the group's debut package, titled Blind Package, which included the group's debut album and album-related materials. The members were revealed through various dance videos and song covers from August 6 to November 19 (in order: Jinni, Jiwoo, Kyujin, Sullyoon, Bae, Haewon, and Lily).\nOn January 26, 2022, JYP Entertainment announced the group's name to be Nmixx, until then tentatively called JYPn. On February 2, it was announced that they would debut on February 22 with the release of Ad Mare. On February 18, 2022, JYP Entertainment announced that the group's debut showcase, originally scheduled for February 22, would be postponed to March 1 after group member Bae tested positive for COVID-19. Nmixx collaborated with the DreamWorks Animation's Gabby's Dollhouse to release the Korean version of \"Hey Gabby!\", alongside the B-side \"Sprinkle Party\", on May 2. They also participated in Project Ribbon's Summer Vacation Project, along with Fromis 9 and Oh My Girl Banhana, to cover Rainbow's \"Kiss\", from their 2009 debut EP Gossip Girl. The song was released on July 31. \nOn September 19, Nmixx released their second single album Entwurf alongside the lead single \"Dice\". The group released their first \"Intermixxion\" single (described by JYP as a special track dropped as a standalone track inbetween official releases) and first Christmas song, \"Funky Glitter Christmas\", on November 23. On December 9, JYP Entertainment announced that Jinni had terminated her contract with the company due to personal reasons, and had departed from the group, while Nmixx would continue as a six-member ensemble.\n\n\n=== 2023–present: Extended plays, showcase tour and fan concerts ===\nOn March 20, 2023, Nmixx released their first extended play Expérgo, with the title track \"Love Me Like This\". They embarked on the Nice to Mixx You Showcase Tour, consisting of 13 dates across the United States and Asia, beginning in May. On May 31, it was reported that JYP Entertainment has expanded their partnership with Republic Records to include Nmixx, along with Xdinary Heroes, in their strategic label deal, which previously included Twice, Itzy and Stray Kids. On July 11, 2023, Nmixx released their third single album A Midsummer Nmixx's Dream, which consists of four tracks, including the pre-release track \"Roller Coaster\", and the title track \"Party O'Clock\" written and composed by J. Y. Park. On August 20, JYP Entertainment announced that Nmixx would be holding their first fan concert Nmixx Change Up: Mixx University, on October 7 and 8 at the Jangchung Arena in Seoul. The group went on to hold the fan concert abroad at Hong Kong, Taipei and Macau in 2024.\nOn January 15, 2024, Nmixx released their second extended play Fe3O4: Break, with the pre-release track \"Soñar (Breaker)\" and the title track \"Dash\". On July 17, JYP Entertainment announced that the group would be holding their second fan concert Nmixx Change Up: Mixx Lab, from October 4 to 6 at the Jangchung Arena in Seoul. Nmixx's third extended play Fe3O4: Stick Out was released on August 19, with the title track \"See That?\". On October 11, the group released the Spanish version of \"Soñar\".\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nGladys Yeo of NME described Nmixx as \"vocal powerhouses\", describing their vocal skills as \"unparalleled\" within their generation of K-Pop. Likewise, Mary Siroky of Consequence said that Nmixx \"often\" delivers \"great vocal performances\". Despite the praise towards their vocals, Nmixx's signature style of music, termed \"Mixxpop\" or \"Mixx Pop\" (stylized in all caps), has been controversial. \nTaylor Glasby of Dazed said that Nmixx's debut single, \"O.O\", had \"choppy arrangement\" and \"loosely structured lyrics\", making note of the fact that ten lyricists were credited for the track. Glasby wrote that the song created \"the biggest ruckus of 2022 [...] across the entire breadth of the K-pop community\". Lily said that the reception towards the song was \"sometimes sad and hard to read about,\" but also stated that \"mixed opinions are better than no opinions\". Writing for Mnet Plus Magazine, Park Soojin said that Mixxpop was less accessible to the public due to \"combining vastly different genres into a single song\". Both Yeo and Park said that Nmixx's 2023 EP Expérgo offered a more public-friendly version of Mixxpop.\n\n\n== Endorsements ==\nIn September 2022, Nmixx were appointed global ambassadors of Spanish luxury fashion house Loewe. Before the announcement, they appeared on the July 2022 cover of Harper's Bazaar Korea in Loewe's Fall 2022 pre-collection. In December 2023, they modelled for the brand's Spring/Summer 2023 pre-collection campaign. In March 2023, they represented the brand in their attendance of Paris Fashion Week and Milan Fashion Week. \nIn July 2023, Nmixx became the muse of ReFa Heart Brush, a product by Japanese beauty brand ReFa, which was featured in their music video for \"Party O'Clock\". They collaborated with the brand in the digital cover of the August 2023 issue of Cosmopolitan Korea.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nLily (릴리) – vocalist\nHaewon (해원) – leader, vocalist\nSullyoon (설윤) – vocalist, dancer\nBae (배이) – vocalist, dancer\nJiwoo (지우) – rapper, vocalist, dancer\nKyujin (규진) – rapper, vocalist, dancer\n\n\n=== Former ===\nJinni (지니) – vocalist, dancer, rapper\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Single albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Promotional singles ===\n\n\n=== Soundtrack appearances ===\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Web shows ===\n\n\n== Concerts and tours ==\nNice to Mixx You Showcase Tour (2023)\nNmixx Change Up: Mixx University Fan Concert (2023–2024)\nNmixx Change Up: Mixx Lab Fan Concert (2024–2025)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

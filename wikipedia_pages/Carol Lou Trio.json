    "text": "The Carol Lou Trio was a jazz combo which gained modest popularity in the mid-eastern United States between the 1950s and 1970s, and international distribution of its few recordings. The group was headed by Carol Lou Hedges (born May 20, 1931, Peru, Indiana), whose modest demeanor belied her piano virtuosity and swinging style. Husband and bassist John Hedges was the other permanent member of the group, with various drummers having been employed, including future drummer for the Count Basie band and Tony Bennett, Harold Jones in 1956-57. The trio's reputation spread mostly by word of mouth, but it did release several singles and one album.\nHaving remarried, Carol Lou Woodward continued to play as a soloist and in small combos in and around her home since 1957, Richmond, Indiana, where Gennett Records produced important early jazz recordings, including the first by Louis Armstrong. In 2013 Woodward recorded an album for the Starr-Gennett Foundation called “Rags to Richmond: A Tribute to Ragtime and Starr Piano.” The album includes three compositions by erstwhile Richmond resident May Aufderheide, a leading female ragtime composer.\nIn 2006, Woodward released a CD featuring solo piano arrangements of jazz and popular music standards, \"An Evening With Carol Lou\". In 2008 she released a holiday collection titled “Christmas With Carol Lou.\"\nShe has said that her favorite pianist is Gene Harris, whose style has been described as \"hard-swinging, soulful, blues-drenched\".  Woodward's considerable talent might have carried her to greater recognition, but she chose instead to raise a family and live quietly.\nJohn Hedges died in October, 2012.\nNow in her nineties, Carol Lou is a weekly entertainer at Saigon Paris Bistro, in Fort Myers, Florida.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Carol Lou Trio\nAlbum\nThe Carol Lou Trio and Geneta Kern\nPainting The Town (Parker Records LP 33-102) 1967\nSide 1\n\n\"Tricky\"\n\"Little Things Mean A Lot\"\n\"On Green Dolphin Street\"\n\"Kansas City\"\n\"Cast Your Fate To The Wind\"\n\"I'm Gonna A Build A Mountain\"\nSide 2\n\n\"Hello Dolly\" (feat.

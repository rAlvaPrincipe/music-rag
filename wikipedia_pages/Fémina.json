    "text": "Fémina is an Argentine folk and fusion trio from San Martín de los Andes, Argentina.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nIn 2004, friends Clara Miglioli and Sofía \"Toti\" Trucco formed Fémina in San Martín de los Andes, Argentina. The trio's name Fémina means female in Latin. The trio chose the name because they liked its sound and message. Band member Toti elaborated \"there were not too many female rappers. It was a way to represent our girl.\" Miglioli met the Trucco sisters when she was four years old. After completing high school, the duo moved to Buenos Aires at the age of 19. They were later joined by Toti's younger sister Clara \"Wewi\" Trucco on percussion. There, they met and became friends with other rappers including Koxmoz and Apolo MC. In addition to music, both Miglioli and the Trucco sisters have a background in acting and vocal training.  Fémina has toured in Latin America, Europe, and the United States. In 2018, they performed at the Sydney Festival in Australia. In an August 2017 interview with the Rolling Stone magazine, the group announced they are working on a new album with producer Will Holland. Several tracks will feature Iggy Pop.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nTheir music often comprises harmonies and poetic rap in Spanish. Themes of their songs typically incorporate folklore, feminism, and Patagonia with an urban twist. In addition, messages of gender inequality, love, and unity can be found throughout their tracks. They were influenced by many artists including Clarice Lispector, Fernando Pessoa, The Roots, Pete Rock, Cypress Hill, and Lauryn Hill.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Sofía \"Toti\" Trucco ===\nToti is 40–41 years old and was raised in San Martín de los Andes.

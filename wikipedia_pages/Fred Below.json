    "text": "Frederick Below Jr. (September 6, 1926 – August 13, 1988) was an American blues drummer who worked with Little Walter and Chess Records in the 1950s. According to Tony Russell, Below was a creator of much of the rhythmic structure of Chicago blues, especially its backbeat.\nHe was the drummer on Chuck Berry's song \"Johnny B. Goode\". He also recorded with J. B. Lenoir.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBelow was born in Chicago, and as he put it – \"grew up around nothing but music\". He started learning music and playing drums in the DuSable High School and at about the age of 14, formed a sort of a jazz band with two of his high school friends, Johnny Griffin and Eugene Wright.\nAs a young man, Below served in the Army twice. The first time between 1945–1946, after being conscripted into the United States Army, he served in the infantry (\"I practiced on helmet liners, helmets, boxes and things like that\").\nIn 1946, when he was discharged from his service and came back home to Chicago, Below attended the reputable Roy C. Knapp School of Percussion, from which he graduated in 1948, and in which he received a wide and thorough musical education.\nBelow re-enlisted the army in 1948, this time as part of the Special Services, and he served in Germany as a member of the 427th Army band. After that second service, he stayed and played in a nightclub in Germany before returning to the United States in 1951.\nBack in Chicago, Below joined the Aces, a band comprising the guitar-playing brothers Louis and Dave Myers and the harmonica player Junior Wells. In 1952, Little Walter left the Muddy Waters band to pursue a solo career, Wells took over his role on harp in the Muddy Waters band, and Walter commandeered the Aces (the Myers brothers and Below). As Little Walter and the Nightcats, they became one of the top electric blues bands in Chicago.\nIn 1955, Below left Little Walter's band to concentrate on working as a session musician for Chess Records. However, he continued to play on Little Walter's records. He also played on hit records for Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Jimmy Rogers, Elmore James, Otis Rush, and Howlin' Wolf.\nBelow worked with bassist Willie Dixon, Little Walter, and guitarist Robert Lockwood, Jr. on John Brim's last single for Chess, \"I Would Hate to See You Go\" (1956).\nAmong his more famous work, he played on Chuck Berry's 1957 hit single \"School Days\" as well as on other Berry recording including \"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\" (1956), \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (1956), \"Too Much Monkey Business\" (1956), the calypso flavored, \"Havana Moon\" (1956), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1957), \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" (1957), \"Reelin' and Rockin'\" (1957), \"Guitar Boogie\" (1957), \"Memphis, Tennessee\" (1958), \"Sweet Little Rock and Roller\" (1958), \"Little Queenie\" (1958), \"Almost Grown\" (1959), \"Back in the U.S.A.\" (1959) and \"Let It Rock\" (1959).\nBelow rejoined the Myers brothers for a tour of Europe in 1970.\nBelow died of liver cancer on August 13, 1988, in Chicago, at the age of 61.\n\n\n== Partial discography ==\n\nWith Howlin' Wolf\n\nLive and Cookin' (Chess, 1972)\nWith Roosevelt Sykes\n\nFeel Like Blowing My Horn (Delmark, 1970 [1973])\nWith Sonny Boy Williamson\n\nThe Real Folk Blues (Chess, 1947-64 [1966])\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFred Below — Magic Maker, an article of September 1983 by Scott K.

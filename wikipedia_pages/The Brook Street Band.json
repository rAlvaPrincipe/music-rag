    "text": "The Brook Street Band is a music ensemble playing on baroque instruments which takes its name from the London street where composer George Frideric Handel lived from 1723-1759. The Band was formed in 1996 by baroque cellist Tatty Theo to perform and record the chamber music of Handel and his contemporaries.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe BSB was set up in 1996, with funds donated by William Pleeth and Margaret Good, cellist Theo’s maternal grandparents. Chamber music making had always been the driving passion in their musical careers and Pleeth and Good recognised the passion Theo had for it, and advised and enabled her to set up The Brook Street Band. The group took its name from Theo’s love for Handel’s music.  \nThe Brook Street Band has become celebrated for its performances, not just of Handel’s music, but that of Johann Sebastian Bach's too. It has performed at many of the UK’s major chamber music venues, as well as at Early Music Festivals in the UK and Europe.\nThe Brook Street Band is a familiar group in the UK’s chamber music scene; from 1997 it has regularly performed for BBC Radio 3, from 1999 at the Dartington International Summer School, and from 2003 at Wigmore Hall.\nThe current core group members of The Brook Street Band are violinists Rachel Harris (1997-2000 and 2006- date) and Kathryn Parry (2018-date), flautist and recorder player Lisete da Silva Bull (2014-date), cellist Tatty Theo and harpsichordist Carolyn Gibley (1999-date).\nPast group members have included violinists Marianna Szücs, Katalin Kertèsz and Farran Scott, and harpsichordists Steven Devine and Catherine Pierron.\nThe Brook Street Band regularly works as a chamber ensemble but often expands for orchestral work. Guest singers have regularly included soprano Nicki Kennedy and bass Matthew Brook.\nThe Brook Street Band started their own biennial \"love:Handel\" festival in 2017. The festival is based in Norwich in the Chapel and Princes Street URC. \n\n\n== Recordings ==\nHandel Oxford Water Music AV0028 (2003)\nHandel Trio Sonatas Op 5 AV2068 (2005)\nHandel 'Cello' Sonatas AV2118 (2007)\nHandel English Cantatas AV2153 (2008)\nBach Trio Sonatas AV2199 (2010)\nHandel Dixit Dominus AV2274 (2013) with Choir of Queen's College, Oxford\nHandel Trio Sonatas Op 2 AV2282 (2013)\nJS/CPE Bach Sonatas for viola da gamba and harpsichord AV2321 (2015)\nHandel Trio Sonatas for 2 violins and BC AV2357 (2016)\nHandel Sonatas for violin and BC AV2387 (2018)\nArne The Judgement of Paris (opera) CDLX7361 (2019)\nLampe The Dragon of Wantley (opera) 2022 conducted John Andrews\nSchütz - A German in Venice (with music by Schütz, Monteverdi, Cavalli, Grandi, Sances and Salomon Rossi) FHR145 (2024)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nBach Cantata's page on The Brook Street Band\n\"The Brook Street Band Trust, registered charity no. 1122890\".

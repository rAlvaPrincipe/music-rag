    "text": "Thunderbugs were a British girl group, briefly popular in 1999 who played their own instruments. Their one major hit, \"Friends Forever\", reached number five in the UK Singles Chart in September 1999. Their follow-up single, \"It's About Time You Were Mine\", failed to reach the Top 40 in December 1999. Due to this flop, the album, Delicious was postponed and ultimately released on minidisc in the UK, and on CD in continental Europe in 2000.\n\n\n== Members of the group ==\nJane Vaughan: lead vocals\nStef Maillard: bass and backing vocals\nNicky Shaw: drums and backing vocals\nBrigitta Jansen: guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nDelicious (2000)\nIt's About Time You Were Mine\nFriends Forever\nWalking On Air\nYou Got Something On Me\nYou And Me\nDoes Your Heart Still Break\nAngel Of The Morning\nMiracle Baby\nJealous\nDelicious\nAlright Now\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Friends Forever\" (1999) - UK #5\n\"It's About Time You Were Mine\" (1999) - UK #43\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThunderbugs discography"

They began self-releasing records and performing around New York City in the spring of 2011. Conveyor released their eponymous debut full-length record on Paper Garden Records in 2012.\nConveyor's musical style has been compared to that of Talking Heads and Dirty Projectors, with \"a quasi-African lilt that happens to be bent by... odd meters.\"\nThe band has recorded live sessions for Grooveshark, Daytrotter and the Bonnaroo Music Festival.  It has also been featured on numerous press outlets, including The New York Times, NPR, Filter, The Deli Magazine, and MTV Hive.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nT.J.

    "text": "The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra was a jazz big band formed by trumpeter Thad Jones and drummer Mel Lewis in New York in 1965. The band performed for twelve years in its original incarnation, including a 1972 tour of the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War.  The collaboration ended in 1978 with Jones suddenly moving to Copenhagen, Denmark, after which the band became the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra. Since the death of Lewis in 1990 it has been known as the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra. They have maintained a Monday-night residency at the Village Vanguard jazz club in New York for five decades. The band won Grammy Awards for the album Live in Munich in 1978 and for the album Monday Night Live at the Village Vanguard in 2009.\n\n\n== History ==\nThad Jones professionally played two instruments, the trumpet and cornet. His older brother was Hank Jones, a jazz pianist, and his younger brother was Elvin Jones, a jazz drummer. Thad Jones had worked as a professional since he was 16, when he played with Hank. After leaving the military in 1946, he performed with territory bands and later with Charles Mingus. From 1954–1963, he was a member of the Count Basie Orchestra, for whom he composed and arranged.\nMel Lewis, a jazz drummer, had been playing in big bands since he was 15, first with Boyd Raeburn, then Alvino Rey, Stan Kenton, Terry Gibbs, and Gerald Wilson. In 1961, he toured the Soviet Union with veteran big band leader Benny Goodman. After Lewis moved to New York City, he met Thad Jones and started the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra at the end of 1965. Beginning in February 1966, the band played every Monday night at the Village Vanguard. \nSince Lewis's death in 1990, the band has been called the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, continuing its tradition as the Village Vanguard's house band.\nThe Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra was arguably the most influential big band since the swing era. Lewis brought a loose, small group style of drumming into the structure of a big band. His cymbal work became a hallmark of the Jones/Lewis Orchestra. Jones's arrangements influenced later, large-ensemble composers, such as Maria Schneider, Bob Brookmeyer, Jim McNeely, and Bob Mintzer. The Jones/Lewis Orchestra was an unusual band, creating new styles, succeeding in an era when big bands were unpopular and remaining integrated during racially tense periods.\nThe band's members included Bill Berry, Billy Harper, Bob Brookmeyer, Danny Stiles, Eddie Daniels, George Mraz, Hank Jones, Jerome Richardson, Jerry Dodgion, Jimmy Knepper, Joe Farrell, Jon Faddis, Marvin Stamm, Pepper Adams, Quentin Jackson, Richard Davis, Richard Williams, Roland Hanna, and Snooky Young.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\n\n=== Grammy Awards ===\nThad Jones/Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra and Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra\n\nThe Vanguard Jazz Orchestra\n\n\n=== From DownBeat ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra ===\nAll My Yesterdays (recorded 1966, released Resonance, 2016) - Live recording including the band's first performance (Monday, Feb. 7, 1966 at the Village Vanguard)\nPresenting Thad Jones/Mel Lewis and the Jazz Orchestra (Solid State, 1966)\nPresenting Joe Williams and Thad Jones/Mel Lewis, the Jazz Orchestra (Solid State, 1966) - with Joe Williams\nLive at the Village Vanguard (Solid State, 1967)\nThe Big Band Sound of Thad Jones/Mel Lewis featuring Miss Ruth Brown (Solid State, 1968) - with Ruth Brown\nMonday Night (Solid State, 1968)\nJazz Casual – Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra...

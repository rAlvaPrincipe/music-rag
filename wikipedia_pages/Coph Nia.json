    "text": "Coph Nia is the name given to the dark ambient act formed by Aldenon Sartorial (Mikael Aldén). Its first release was the album That Which Remains, which was released in 2000 at Cold Meat Industry. The original members were Mikael Aldén (composition), Magnus Baecklund (lyrics), Clara Pahlén (vocals on Our Lady of the Stars and Sanctus), and Aasa Vildblomma (percussion). The three latter members, however, only participated on the first album: That which Remains (2000).\nThe name itself derives from Chapter 3 of  Aleister Crowley’s Liber AL vel Legis. The passage reads in full: “I am the Lord of the Double Wand of Power; the wand of the Force of Coph Nia—but my left hand is empty, for I have crushed an Universe; & nought remains.” (AL III:72) Itself thought to be a reference to Ain Soph.\nCoph Nia's music tends to drift between dark ambient soundscapes and tracks that portray Aldenon's interest in the Western magical tradition, and the work of Aleister Crowley in particular.[1]\n\n\n== Discography ==\nErotomechankis II - split with Mindspawn, Raubbau - Raub-047, 2016\nLashtal Lace, Raubbau - Raub-027, CD, 2015\nA Prelude To Lashtal Lace, Raubbau - Raub-026, EP/12\", 2014\nThe Tree of Life and Death, (self-released), Digital, 2008\nQliphothic Phantasmagoria, Wrotycz Records - WRT 008, EP/CD, 2008\nThe Dark Illuminati - A Celestial Tragedy in two acts - CD, 2007\nErotomechaniks - with Mindspawn, Punch Records - PP009, CD (limited to 500 copies), 2005\nNoise Shaper - CDR (limited to 161 copies), 2004\nShape Shifter - Cold Meat Industry - CMI122, CD, 2003\nNunsploitation - split with Brighter Death Now, Cold Meat Industry - CMI110, 12\", 2003\nThat Which is Remade - CD, 2001\nHoly War EP - Cold Meat Industry - CMI93, MCD, 2000\nThat Which Remains - Cold Meat Industry - CMI85, CD, 2000\n\n\n== Compilations ==\nThe Oath on Flowers Made of Snow - Cold Meat Industry - CMI130, DCD, 2004\nThe Scapegoat mk.

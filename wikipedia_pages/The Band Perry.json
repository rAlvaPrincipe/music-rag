    "text": "The Band Perry were an American band composed of siblings Kimberly Perry (lead vocals, guitar), Reid Perry (bass guitar, background vocals), and Neil Perry (mandolin, bouzouki, background vocals).\nThey signed to Republic Nashville in August 2009 and released their self-titled debut album on October 12, 2010. From this album, \"If I Die Young\" reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs and Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts and has been certified 9x multi-platinum.\nTheir second album, Pioneer, was released April 2, 2013. It produced additional number one singles in \"Better Dig Two\" and \"Done\", plus the top 10 hits \"Don't Let Me Be Lonely\" and \"Chainsaw\".\nThe band transitioned to pop in 2017 and began to release music independently in 2018 before officially going on hiatus in 2023. Following this, Kimberly returned to her country roots and launched a solo career.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2005–09: Formation and early career ===\n\nKimberly Perry sang in her own band as a teenager with her brothers Neil and Reid working as roadies. At ages 8 and 10, the brothers began performing as an opening act, the Mobile Music Machines, for Kimberly. Kimberly released an EP entitled \"Carry On\" with a song of the same name inspiring two songs on \"Pioneer\". Once they had united to form as \"the Band Perry\", they joined a New Faces of Country tour in 2005.\nIn 2008, they were discovered by Garth Brooks' manager Bob Doyle, who helped them make recordings that were sent to Scott Borchetta, head of the newly established Republic Nashville label. They signed to Republic Nashville in August 2009 and released their debut single \"Hip to My Heart\". All three members wrote it with Brett Beavers. The song peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot Country chart. A self-titled extended play followed in April.\n\n\n=== 2010–14: The Band Perry and Pioneer ===\nAfter \"Hip to My Heart\" fell from the charts, the Band Perry released their second single, \"If I Die Young\", written by Kimberly. \"If I Die Young\" and \"Hip to My Heart\" are on the band's self-titled debut album, released on October 12, 2010. The album was produced by Paul Worley and Nathan Chapman. \"If I Die Young\" reached No. 1 on the country music chart, and No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album's third single, \"You Lie\", was written by Brian Henningsen, Aaron Henningsen, and Clara Henningsen. It debuted in December 2010 and hit No. 2 in 2011. After it, \"All Your Life\" reached number 1 in February 2012, and \"Postcard from Paris\" reached number 6. The album sold 1.6 million copies.\nIn mid-2012, the band began working with producer Rick Rubin on their second album, Pioneer, which was released on April 2, 2013. The album's first single, \"Better Dig Two\", was released to country radio on October 30, 2012. The album's second single, \"Done\", charted in March 2013 ahead of its release date, reaching number 8 on the Hot Country chart. It reached number 1 on the Country Airplay chart in August 2013. Pioneer ended up being produced by Dann Huff and became the group's first number one on the Top Country Albums chart in addition to reaching the number two spot on the all-genre Billboard 200. The album's third single, \"Don't Let Me Be Lonely\", was released to country radio on August 26, 2013. It reached number 2 on the Country Airplay chart in February 2014. The album's fourth single, \"Chainsaw\", which was originally recorded by the group Old Dominion, was released to country radio on March 3, 2014. The song peaked at number 10 on Country Airplay. Later that year, they recorded a cover of the Glen Campbell hit, \"Gentle on My Mind\", for the documentary about the singer titled Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me, which was released as a standalone single. The band performed in the pre-game show of Super Bowl XLVIII, on Sunday, February 2, 2014.\n\n\n=== 2015–2017: Label change, My Bad Imagination and transition to pop ===\nOn August 14, 2015, the band released their new single called \"Live Forever\", the first single off their upcoming third studio album. One of the musicians they collaborated with on \"Live Forever\" is pop producer RedOne (Lady Gaga, Enrique Iglesias). The music video for it premiered on August 15, 2015, on CMT. On March 1, 2016, the Band Perry parted ways with their record label, Republic Nashville. Billboard announced on May 12, 2016, that the band had signed with Interscope Records. According to the magazine, the Band Perry is transitioning to pop music but will continue releasing select singles to the country format through sister label UMG Nashville.\nTheir third studio album, tentatively titled Heart + Beat, was to have included material recorded while the trio was signed to Republic Nashville (including \"Live Forever\") as well as new songs. The band later shot down rumors that they were \"going pop\". The Band Perry stated that the main reason they signed with Interscope was so that their music could be distributed to other formats of radio, besides country. In July 2016, Neil, Reid, and Kimberly appeared on Celebrity Family Feud, where Kimberly scored 196 points in the Fast Money round, which host Steve Harvey said might be the record. The Band Perry released their next single, \"Comeback Kid\", to country radio on August 1, 2016, through Mercury Nashville.\nOn February 2, 2017, the band announced the title of their third album, My Bad Imagination. Unlike their previous two albums, this one would be pop. They said, \"Creating it has been the most exciting thing we've ever done.\" Another pop single, \"Stay in the Dark\", followed in 2017. The album was subsequently confirmed a year later to have been scrapped.\n\n\n=== 2018–present: Label change, Coordinates, hiatus ===\nIn mid-2018, the band left Interscope Records/Mercury Nashville to release music independently. On September 21, the band released a five-song collection called Coordinates via ARTRAT, their newly formed creative house. The band wrote and produced all 5 songs themselves while Rick Rubin oversaw the project as executive producer.\nOn March 27, 2023, the band announced that they are going on a hiatus to focus on solo work. Kimberly announced her debut solo EP Bloom alongside the release of \"If I Die Young Pt. 2\". The EP was released on June 9, 2023.\nKimberly made her solo debut on the Grand Ole Opry on May 6, 2023.\n\n\n== Personal lives ==\nKimberly Marie Perry was born on July 12, 1983. On September 30, 2013, Kimberly became engaged to J. P. Arencibia, at that time a catcher with the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball. They were married on June 12, 2014, in Greeneville, Tennessee. In March 2018, she filed for divorce from Arencibia. Kimberly married Johnny Constello in June 2021. On April 13th, 2023, the couple announced they are expecting their first child in August.\nReid Hogan Perry was born on November 17, 1988. Neil Clark Perry was born on July 23, 1990. Kimberly and her brothers are the niece and nephews of baseball author and journalist Dayn Perry.\nAll three Perry siblings were born in Jackson, Mississippi, and raised in nearby Ridgeland.\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nThe Band Perry started their November tour in September by putting on a concert to benefit Heifer International and their fight to end global hunger.\nThey received positive publicity in 2014 after offering to cover the burial expenses for the funerals of nine people (a mother and eight of her children) killed in an accidental house fire in the Greenville, Kentucky, area in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. The band also paid the costs of family members' hotel expenses while the father and the surviving daughter were being treated for burns at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. They have also volunteered their time to support Alzheimer's research.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nThe Band Perry (2010)\nPioneer (2013)\n\n\n== Tours ==\nHeadlining\n\nWe Are Pioneers World Tour with Lindsay Ell & Easton Corbin (2013–14).\nCoordinates Tour (2018)\nThe Good Life Tour (2019)\nSupporting\n\nAll the Women I Am Tour (2011) with Reba McEntire\nVirtual Reality Tour (2012) with Brad Paisley\nLive & Loud Tour (2013) with Rascal Flatts\nTen Times Crazier Tour (2014) with Blake Shelton\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References =="

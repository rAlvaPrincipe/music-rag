    "text": "Air is a French music duo from Versailles, consisting of Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoît Dunckel. Their critically acclaimed debut album, Moon Safari, including the track \"Sexy Boy\", was an international success in 1998. Its follow-up, The Virgin Suicides, was the score to Sofia Coppola's first film The Virgin Suicides. The band has since released the albums 10 000 Hz Legend, Talkie Walkie, Pocket Symphony, Love 2, Le voyage dans la lune and Music for Museum. The band is influenced by a wide variety of musical styles and artists.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nNicolas Godin studied architecture at the École nationale supérieure d'architecture de Versailles, and Jean-Benoît Dunckel studied mathematics, before forming a band in 1995. Before founding Air, Dunckel and Godin played together in the band Orange with others such as Alex Gopher, Xavier Jamaux and Jean de Reydellet. The former two subsequently contributed to remixes of tracks recorded by Air.\nInitially Godin worked alone, recording a demo with members of Funkadelic as his backing band before releasing his first entirely solo effort, \"Modular Mix\", which featured production by Étienne de Crécy.\n\n\n=== Recording career ===\nAfter making several remixes for other acts in the early 1990s, Air recorded its first EP, Premiers Symptômes, in 1995. The band's first full-length album, Moon Safari, was released in 1998. The first single off the album, \"Sexy Boy\", received heavy airplay on alternative radio stations, and Moon Safari became an international success. In 1999, Air composed the original score for Sofia Coppola's debut film The Virgin Suicides. In 2012, Air completed its second score, to accompany Georges Méliès' early silent film Le Voyage Dans La Lune. Dunckel and Godin also released four other studio albums in the 2000s, including 10 000 Hz Legend (2001), Talkie Walkie (2004), Pocket Symphony (2007), and Love 2 (2009).\n\n\n=== Other work ===\nAir has often collaborated with film director Sofia Coppola. Air drummer and former Redd Kross member Brian Reitzell put together the soundtrack to 2003's Lost in Translation, including one original contribution by Air titled \"Alone in Kyoto\". The soundtrack for Coppola's October 2006 film Marie Antoinette featured a track by Air (\"Il Secondo Giorno\"). Air wrote and played the music of the album 5:55 by Anglo-French actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, which was released in August 2006. Air has recorded a DJ mix album, Late Night Tales: Air, for Azuli Records' Late Night Tales series. The release was initially scheduled for October 2005, but was delayed several times. It finally was released, complete with a new sleeve design, in September 2006. Darkel, a solo album by Dunckel, was released that same year.\nCity Reading (Tre Storie Western) (2003) started as an idea for a collaboration with contemporary Italian writer Alessandro Baricco, known for his unusual characterizations and lyrical, poetic style. Baricco contacted Air in summer 2002 with the idea to marry narration of texts from his book City with live original musical accompaniment. The performance premiered live in November 2002 at Rome's Teatro Valle and was deemed such a success that both parties resolved to make a full studio recording.\n\n\n== Influences and musical style ==\nAir is associated with a variety of musical styles: electronica, space pop, dream pop, progressive rock, downtempo, chillout, trip hop, ambient, electronic pop and space rock. Dunckel grew up listening to both classical and electronic music, especially Kraftwerk, and also the 1960s and 1970s music of Serge Gainsbourg. He later took an interest in what he called the \"English dark rock\" of Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, while being a fan of David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. Brian Eno and Cluster were two of the electronic acts who inspired him the most. He cites among his favorite artists: Maurice Ravel for classical music, François de Roubaix for music soundtracks and Siouxsie and the Banshees for pop music. Dunckel shared with Godin a special liking for the music of Michel Legrand, Philip Glass and Grace Jones. During his childhood, Godin was fascinated by the Beatles before later discovering the soul of Sly and the Family Stone, and film soundtracks like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly by Ennio Morricone. The duo were influenced by progressive rock pioneers Pink Floyd.\nAir uses many of its studio instruments (including Moog synthesizers, the Korg MS-20, Wurlitzers and vocoders) on stage. The band performs tracks from their albums live as extended or altered versions. Air often collaborates (both in the studio and live) with artists like Beth Hirsch (Moon Safari), Françoise Hardy (\"Jeanne\"), Jean-Jacques Perrey (\"Cosmic Bird\"), Gordon Tracks (\"Playground Love\" and \"Easy Going Woman\" – Gordon Tracks is a pseudonym of the French singer Thomas Mars from Phoenix), Beck (10 000 Hz Legend) and Jean-Michel Jarre (\"Close Your Eyes\" from Jarre's Electronica 1: The Time Machine). They also invited Dave Palmer on their 2004 tour and drummer Earl Harvin, Vincent Taurelle and Steve Jones on their 2007 tour.\n\n\n== AIR as an acronym ==\nThe band has given conflicting information about whether Air is an acronym. In a clip aired in 2022, Godin told the BBC, \"AIR is an acronym. I don't know if you have the same word in English, but it's, uh, 'amour, imagination, and rêve'.\" Dunckel apparently said the same thing, as the interview cuts to a separately filmed portion where Dunckel says \"...which means 'love, imagination, and dreaming'.\"\nHowever, in a 1998 interview for Australian magazine Rave, Godin reportedly denied the claim, saying \"No. Someone made that up, but it was a really nice thing to do. I wish I could have that idea.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nMoon Safari (1998)\n10 000 Hz Legend (2001)\nTalkie Walkie (2004)\nPocket Symphony (2007)\nLove 2 (2009)\nLe voyage dans la lune (2012)\n\n\n== Awards ==\nAir won the award for Best Music Video at the 2011 Byron Bay International Film Festival for the video to \"So Light Is Her Footfall\".\n\n\n== Documentaries about Air ==\n\n\n=== Air: Eating, Sleeping, Waiting and Playing (1999) ===\nIn 1999, American film and music video director, writer, and graphic designer Mike Mills released a 75-minute black-and-white documentary titled Air: Eating, Sleeping, Waiting and Playing. The film, shot during Air's 1998 tour, captures band members Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoît Dunckel during stops in New York, London, and Paris. As suggested by the title, the documentary's tone and form focus on the drudgery and banality of real-life touring for music artists.\nMills had previously collaborated with Air on their music videos.\nThe documentary was distributed by Source - une division de Virgin disques as a Stereo DVD.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ambient music artists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nAir discography at Discogs\nAir at IMDb\nDiscography of early works"

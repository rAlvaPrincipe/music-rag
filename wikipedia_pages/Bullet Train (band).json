    "text": "Bullet Train (超特急, Chōtokkyū) are a Japanese boy band formed on December 25, 2011, under Stardust Promotion. The group debuted under the name \"超特急☆-BULLET TRAIN- (Chōtokkyū☆-BULLET TRAIN-)\" but later changed the name to \"超特急 (Chōtokkyū)\". The group consists of \"main dancers\" and \"back vocalists\", meaning that the vocalists stand behind the dancers when the band is performing. Bullet Train has been likened to Momoiro Clover Z, an idol girl group managed by the same talent agency. Consisting of 4 main dancers, the center among the dancers changes for each single. In 2018 they won their first award on MAMA2018 in Japan.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nAs of August 2022, the group consists of 9 members.\n\nKai (カイ) / Kai Ogasawara (小笠原 海)          - 27 September 1994  -Main Dancer -Blue      -Mysterious\n\nRyoga (リョウガ) / Ryōga Funatsu (船津 稜雅) - Leader  -23 October 1994  -Main Dancer -Purple -Skinny\nTakuya (タクヤ) / Takuya Kusakawa (草川 拓弥) -24 November 1994 -Main Dancer        -Green -Muscle\nYuki (ユーキ) / Yūki Murata (村田 祐基)         -Former Leader -2 January 1995  -Main Dancer -Red -Clumsy\nTakashi (タカシ) / Takashi Matsuo (松尾 太陽) -23 September 1996 -Backup Vocal         -White -Youngest Child (Takashi the youngest member before Haru joined the group)\nShuya (シューヤ) / Shūya Shimura (志村秀哉) -25 March 1995 -Backup Vocal\nMasahiro (マサヒロ) / Masahiro Moritsugu (森次政裕) -15 September 1998 -Main Dancer\nAloha (アロハ) / Aloha Takamatsu (髙松アロハ) -26 October 2000 -Main Dancer\nHaru (ハル) / Haru Kashiwagi (柏木悠)      -31 March 2005 -Main Dancer\n\n\n=== Former ===\nSho (ショウ) / Shō Takemura (竹村翔)\nKoichi (コーイチ) / Kōichi Yoshino (吉野晃一)  -18 June 1994 -Backup Vocal -Black\nYusuke (ユースケ) / Yūsuke Fukuda (福田佑亮) -24 December 1995 -Main Dancer -Yellow\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Digital singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

It is one of the oldest bands in the Pac-12 and the primary athletic band at Oregon State. In addition to the Oregon State University Marching Band, other athletic bands include Basketball Band, Rhythm & Beavs, Rhythm & Beavs: Travel Band, the Away Game Pep Band (for select away games), Alumni Band (the band that covers any games occurring prior to the start of the school term), Gymnastics Band (the ensemble that performs at home gymnastic meets; this ensemble also include alumni members), and Bar Band (a small ensemble that tours local bars on the day before a home football game). All band members are required to participate in marching band before they may be eligible to participate in any of the other athletic bands Oregon State offers.\nThe Athletic Bands program is based partially on the same program at Kansas State University.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n1890  –The Oregon State University Marching Band was founded.\n1890 – Brass band organized in November; students had to procure their own instruments.\n1892 – Cadet Band played at first school athletic event, an all-school intramural \"Field Day.\"\n1893 – Cadet Band played at the first school football game, held in Albany, Oregon.\n1901 – Self-sustaining Department of Music established.\n1914 – \"Hail to Old O.A.C.\" is written by Wilkins.\n1917 – \"Carry Me Back,\" is written by W.

Students are welcome from all fields of study.\n\n\n== Game day ==\nThe Oregon State University Marching Band performs at all Oregon State University home and bowl games. During these game days, the marching band begins their day with a pre-performance rehearsal. During this rehearsal, the band will briefly rehearse the halftime show and the pre-game sequence. After rehearsal, the band will set up a parade block to prepare for the \"Beaver Walk\" (an event where the football team walks west on SW Ralph Miller Street. Prior to the start of the game,the band congregates inside Reser Stadium for an on-field pregame performance. The only exception to this is Civil War at OSU. Instead of a parading, the band will meet with the Oregon Marching Band face-to-face for Battle of the Bands.\nDuring the football games, the band plays music from their seats in the stands, and during halftime performs an on-field show.\nAt the conclusion of each home game the band performs the fight song \"Hail to OSU\" and the alma mater \"Carry Me Back to OSU\". Additional music is performed in a post-game show from the stands.\n\n\n== Away game trips ==\nThe Oregon State Marching Band typically attends one away game each year, in addition to the Civil War if it is held at the University of Oregon. The entire band travels to any high-profile Bowl Games, while lower-tiered Bowl Games usually are accompanied by a smaller \"pep band\" from within the band.\n\n\n=== Bowl game appearances ===\n2001 Fiesta Bowl (full band)\n2002 Insight Bowl (pep band)\n2003 Las Vegas Bowl (pep band)\n2004 Insight Bowl (pep band)\n2006 Sun Bowl (full band)\n2007 Emerald Bowl (pep band)\n2008 Sun Bowl (full band)\n2009 Las Vegas Bowl (pep band)\n2012 Alamo Bowl (full band)\n  2021 LA Bowl (full band)\n2022 Las Vegas Bowl (full band)\n2023 Sun Bowl (partial band band)\n\n\n== Uniforms ==\n\n\n=== Types of uniforms ===\nThe marching band has three different variations to their uniform; the uniform that the marching band wears will depend on the type of event. There are three different variations: Full Dress, \"Beaver Casual\", and \"Beaver Scuzzy\". Full Dress is used exclusively during the fall season and only during special parades and most football games. \"Beaver Casual\" is used as the default uniform primarily for pep band events, basketball band, and other related events that do not require the full uniform; this uniform can be used year-round. The Beaver Casual uniform consists of the OSU Band baseball cap, orange polo, black slacks, black belt, and black socks and shoes. \"Beaver Scuzzy\" consist of the orange OSU band T-shirt and blue jeans and is normally used for informal events such as bar band.\n\n\n=== Earlier uniforms (1989 and earlier) ===\nOrange and white jackets, tall helmets, and large white plumes.\nOther previous uniforms have included a version with shoulder-tassels and other regalia, black uniforms with orange half-capes and orange military helmets (used in 1941 season), and military cadet uniforms.\nPast Featured Twirlers have historically worn uniforms mainly of white with short or no legs.\n\n\n=== 1997–2005 ===\nThe previous set of uniforms consistent of orange and black jackets with silver sequins, as well as black gloves and gauntlets, black pants and shoes, black shako, and black and silver tasseled plumes.\n\n\n=== 2006–2015 ===\nOrange and black jackets with white stripes and the \"Beavers\" logo in the center of a white shield on the front, white gauntlets, white gloves, black pants, and black shako with mirrors and black feathered plumes. The drum majors have an alternate version, substituting the jacket colors of orange and black with black and white, larger white plumes, and optional black gauntlets.\n\n\n=== 2016–present ===\nThe new uniforms were unveiled July 2016. The uniform consists of a tall, 16\" black feather plume with a shako featuring an orange colored front side. The jacket features an orange and black body color split featuring the beaver logo on the wearer's top left and the Oregon State logo embroidered vertically along the black edge of the split. The rear side of the jacket features the orange OSU block letters arranged vertically along the back side. The features a traditional canopy that resembles traditional uniforms college bands traditionally wear. The gauntlets are black with the beaver script logo embroidered on them; these are worn with black gloves. Bibber pants are black with no unique design features. The overall design of the uniform borrowed many design elements from uniform designs of the 70's with contemporary styling from new the logos and colors.\n\n\n== Band composition ==\n\n\n=== Instrumentation ===\nThe instrumentation does not include percussion typically located in the \"Front Ensemble\" or \"Pit\" (Bells and other instruments on wheels) due to the band's emphasis on performing for the crowd, as opposed to the drum corps style utilized by most high schools and by a handful of university marching bands. Larger sections have multiple parts and divide up the sections to play those parts.\n\nPiccolo\nClarinet\nAlto Saxophone\nTenor Saxophone\nMellophone\nTrumpet\nTrombone\nBaritone\nSousaphone\nBattery Percussion (Bass drums, tenor drums, snare drums, cymbals)\n\n\n=== Color guard ===\nFlags\nRifles\n\n\n== Repertoire ==\n\n\n=== Fight Song: \"Hail to Old OSU\" ===\n\n\"Hail to Old OSU\" is the fight song for Oregon State University. It was written by Harold a. Wilkins (Class of 1907) in 1914. The song consists of two verses and a chorus. It was originally called \"Hail to Old O.A.C.\" and has officially remained unaltered except in the school initials as the school's name underwent changes to Oregon State College, and later, Oregon State University.\n\n\n=== Alma Mater ===\nThe OSU Alma Mater, \"Carry Me Back\", was written by W. Homer Maris.\n\n   \nWithin a vale of western mountains,\nThere's a college we hold dear.\nHer shady slopes and fountains\nOft to me appear.\nI love to wander on the pathway\nDown to the Trysting Tree,\nFor there again I see in fancy,\nOld friends dear to me.\n\n[CHORUS]\nCarry me back to OSU,\nBack to her vine-clad halls;\nThus fondly ever in my mem'ry\nAlma Mater calls.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nFounding members of The Crazy 8's, a popular college band in the 1980s known for its hit \"Johnny Q.\"\nGeorge Bruns, noted music arranger for the Walt Disney Company\n\n\n== References =="

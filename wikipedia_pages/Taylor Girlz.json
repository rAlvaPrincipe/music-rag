Raised in Atlanta, the Taylor sisters were inspired by their father's rapping to develop their own rhymes. They began working with Tiny in 2013. Now a full-fledged girl group, they first gained popularity in 2015 with their \"Woozie\" dance video.\nIn 2016 they released two singles produced by Bolo Da Producer (Silent√≥ of \"Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)\" fame), \"Steal Her Man\" and \"Wedgie,\" both featuring third Taylor sister Trinity.

    "text": "The Dixie Bee-Liners are an American bluegrass group, formed in New York City in 2002 by Buddy Woodward and Brandi Hart. Their music has been called Bluegrass, Americana, alt-country, Folk, and \"Bible Belt Noir\".\nThe Bee-Liners have released three records, and two singles.  Their first recording was a 2005 self-titled/self-released CD-EP on their own label, Betty Troublesome.  Shortly after, Hart and Woodward relocated to Southwest Virginia, and signed with Pinecastle Records, who released their first full-length CD, RIPE, in April 2008.\nTheir third CD, Susanville, was a bluegrass concept album released in November 2009. Grammy winning producer/engineer Bil VornDick co-produced the 19-song CD, along with Woodward and Hart.\nIn mid-2012 the band revealed in an interview with Bluegrass Today that they were working on a new album with a projected release of Spring 2013, but the project was never completed and the band folded at the end of 2012.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nOstensibly a bluegrass band, The Dixie Bee-Liners played a wide variety of acoustic music, liberally cherry-picking influence from traditional bluegrass, newgrass, old-time string band music, as well as west-coast country, country rock, 60's British invasion, surf music, Celtic, rhythm & blues, punk, ska, and English folk-rock bands. In mid-2012 the band revealed in an interview with Bluegrass Today that they were evolving their sound, and expanding their lineup to include drums and electric instrumentation, but the project was never completed, and they split at the end of the year.\nBuddy Woodward and Brandi Hart typically wrote all of the band's material—with Woodward also taking the role of arranger and producer—though they occasionally co-wrote with various band members, as well as Blue Highway's Tim Stafford, Jon Weisberger, and Ken Stringfellow of the American alternative rock band The Posies.\nIn addition to standardized bluegrass instrumentation, the band were known to incorporate alternate guitar tunings, claw-hammer banjo, dulcimer, bouzouki, dobro, Dojo, harmonica, chanter, 12-string guitar, drums, electric guitar, pedal steel guitar, cello, Mellotron, harpsichord, and other keyboard instruments.\n\n\n== Awards, honors, distinctions ==\nTheir self-titled EP debuted on the Roots Music Report bluegrass chart at No. 14, going on to spend 56 weeks on the chart, with 9 of those weeks in the Top 10. RIPE topped the Bluegrass Now Fan's Choice Top 20 chart twice, and also achieved two simultaneous No. 1's on Bluegrass Music Profiles' Top 20 Hot Singles, and the Roots Music Report Bluegrass Chart.  The Bee-Liners spent nine consecutive weeks atop the RMR Bluegrass chart and two consecutive months in the Top Ten of both Bluegrass Unlimited charts.  All-told, the band achieved 23 weeks of No. 1's in 2008, and was named the Roots Music Report's Bluegrass Artist of the Year in November 2008.  Susanville debuted on the Billboard Bluegrass chart at No. 32.\n\n\n== Performance ==\nThe band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada, playing such prestigious festivals as Merlefest, Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival, Palisade Bluegrass & Roots Festival, Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion, FloydFest and Bean Blossom, among many others. They appeared live on BBC Radio Scotland, NPR, the Food Network, and were featured on radio playlists across the country and worldwide, including regular rotation on Sirius and XM satellite radio.  In 2007 their music appeared on the soundtrack of the independently produced Civil War film FREEDOM. In August 2010, the band played Fairport's Cropredy Convention Festival in the Oxfordshire village of Cropredy, one of only two gigs in England before returning home.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Upstate Manhattan-compilation ===\nOctober 2005 (207 Records)\n\nLost In The Silence - (Hart, Woodward)\n\n\n=== The Dixie Bee-Liners-EP ===\nNovember 2005 (Betty Troublesome)\n\nDavy - (Hart, Woodward)\nBrown-Eyed Darlin' - (Woodward)\nLost In The Silence - (Hart, Woodward)\nRoses Are Grey - (Hart, Woodward)\nFamily Tree - (Woodward, Gold, Ribyat)\nMy Heart's Breakin' In - (Hart, Woodward)\nYellow-Haired Girl - (Hart, Woodward)\n(Lord, Lay Down My) Ball & Chain - (Hart, Woodward)\n\n\n=== Timeless Flyte: A Tribute To The Byrds-compilation ===\n2007, RRO Entertainment\n\nChange Is Now - (Hillman-McGuinn)\n\n\n=== Prime Cuts of Bluegrass Volume 90-compilation ===\n2007, KBC Music, Inc.\n\nDown On The Crooked Road - (Woodward, VornDick, Hart)\n\n\n=== RIPE ===\nApril 2008 (Pinecastle Records)\n\nDown On The Crooked Road - (Woodward, VornDick, Hart)\n(Lord, Lay Down My) Ball & Chain - (Hart, Woodward)\nYellow-Haired Girl - (Hart, Woodward)\nThe Bugs In The Basement - (Hart, Woodward)\nDixie Grey To Black - (Hart, Woodward)\nWhy Do I Make You Cry - (Hart, Woodward)\nShe's My Angel - (Hart, Woodward)\nOld Charlie Cross - (Hart, Woodward)\nLost In The Silence - (Hart, Woodward)\nGrumble Jones - (Woodward, Stafford)\nJefferson Railroad Line - (Hart, Woodward)\nRipe - (Hart, Woodward)\n\n\n=== FestivaLink presents The Dixie Bee-Liners at MerleFest, NC 4/24/09 ===\nJune 2009 (FesivaLink)\n\nMarried By The Hanging Judge - (Morrow)\n(Lord, Lay Down My) Ball & Chain - (Hart, Woodward)\nYellow-Haired Girl - (Hart, Woodward)\nShe's My Angel - (Hart, Woodward)\nThe Bugs In The Basement - (Hart, Woodward)\nRipe - (Hart, Woodward)\nDown On The Crooked Road - (Woodward, VornDick, Hart)\nWhy Do I Make You Cry - (Hart, Woodward)\nI'll Remember You, Love, In My Prayers -  (Public Domain) [Bonus Track - 4/26/09 Hillside Stage]\nOld Charlie Cross - (Hart, Woodward) [Bonus Track - 4/26/09 Hillside Stage]\nDavy - (Hart, Woodward) [Bonus Track - 4/26/09 Hillside Stage]\nPossum John - (Johnson) [Bonus Track - 4/26/09 Hillside Stage]\n\n\n=== She Plays Like A Girl-Digital Single ===\nOctober 2009 (Pinecastle Records)\n\nShe Plays Like A Girl - (Hart, Woodward)\n\n\n=== Susanville ===\nNovember 2009 (Pinecastle Records)\n\nEnter Highway - (Hart, Woodward)\nHeavy - (Hart, Woodward)\nRestless - (Hart, Woodward)\nFind Out - (Hart, Woodward)\nRoad Hog - (Hart, Woodward, Weisberger)\nSalem And Staunton - (Darrow)\nTurn Back - (Hart, Woodward)\nTruck Stop Baby - (Hart, Woodward)\nAlbion Road - (Morrow)\nSusanville - (Hart, Woodward)\n(I Need) Eighteen Wheels - (Hart, Woodward)\nTrixie's Diesel-Stop Cafe - (Hart, Woodward)\nGraveyard Shift - (Hart, Woodward)\nDown - (Woodward.

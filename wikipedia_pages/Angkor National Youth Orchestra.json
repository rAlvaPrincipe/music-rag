    "text": "The Angkor Youth Orchestra (ANYO) (established in 2006 or 2007) is a Cambodian youth orchestra. Its first performance was at the Angkor Wat temple complex. It is the first establishment for orchestral classical music in Cambodia since the Sangkum Reahniyum Era (1953–1970). The Orchestra is supervised by two musicians: Tep Kuntheareth and Ram Daravong.\nUnder the coordination of the Cambodian cabinet and with the support of Gunma Junior Orchestra and Shinichi Minami, ANYO has been receiving donations and grown gradually to become a symphony orchestra.\nThe previous headquarters of ANYO were at the Secondary School of Fine Arts (Cambodia). For current headquarters please check the external link.\nANYO is composed of Cambodian teachers (educated in the former USSR) and young musicians with a total number of around 60 or 70. Most of the musicians come from the Royal University of Fine Arts. Others pay to be taught music and are automatically included in ANYO. Instruments include violins, violas, cellos, double basses and clarinets.\nANYO is still recruiting new musicians and receiving new students.\n\n\n== Performances ==\nANYO holds regular annual performances.\n\nAngkor Wat Stage\nWater Festival: Channel 9's Alain de Londre Concert 2009\nHRH former queen Norodom Monineath Sihanouk's birthday 2010\nCharity Concert: ANYO 2010\n7th International Music Festival, Phnom Penh 2010\n9th International Music Festival, Phnom Penh 2012\n37th Session of The World Heritage Committee's Meeting Opening Ceremony\n10th International Music Festival, Phnom Penh 2013\nINTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP ORCHESTRA CONCERT 2014,CELEBRATORY CONCERT OF 10th ANNIVERSARY OF\nKING’S CORONATION.

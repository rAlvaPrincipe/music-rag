    "text": "EarthGang (stylized EARTHGANG) is an American hip hop duo from Atlanta, Georgia, composed of Olu (aka Johnny Venus; born Olu Onyemachi Dakarai Fann) and WowGr8 (aka Doctur Dot; born Eian Parker). They are co-founders of the musical collective Spillage Village, with JID, Hollywood JB, JordxnBryant, 6lack, Mereba, and Benji.\nFormed in 2008, EarthGang released their first EP, The Better Party, in 2010. This was followed by several singles and two mixtapes, Mad Men and Good News in 2011. In 2013, the duo released their debut album Shallow Graves For Toys and was largely well-received, with Noisey calling it \"one of the most well thought-out releases of the year\" and praising the album's \"playful delivery and biting lyricism.\" Their second album, Strays with Rabies, was released to positive reviews in 2015. After signing to J. Cole's Dreamville Records, EarthGang released a trilogy of EPs: Rags, Robots (2017), and Royalty (2018), leading up to their major label debut album, Mirrorland (2019).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2008–2009: Formation ===\nThe rap duo EarthGang was first formed in 2008 by Johnny Venus and Doctur Dot, then both high school students in Atlanta, Georgia. According to Johnny Venus, they had first met on a field trip in 9th grade at Benjamin Elijah Mays High School, with Venus later approaching Doctur Dot to ask about forming a music group. Avid fans of rap and hip hop, both members had grown up listening to artists as diverse as the Ohio Players, Dizzy Gillespie, Madonna, and Richard Pryor. About their name EarthGang, Venus explained in 2011 that \"The name came to me abruptly one day. It represents what we're made of and why we do what we do. It's for the people by the people. Our music is influenced by the conscious and subconscious, and we create it to influence the like.\"\n\n\n=== 2010–2013: Early releases ===\nOn January 26, 2010, the group released its first EP, the mixtape titled The Better Party. Their first full-length recording project, they recorded in a multitude of studio spaces, which, according to Venus, included \"dorm rooms at Hampton University, closets in Atlanta, a house studio owned by 'Mr. Fish' (a fellow underground Atlanta musician), and finally in Hampton University's Music Recording Technology Jazz studio.\" The EP was mixed and mastered by EarthGang, with help from Jack Swain. Also in 2010, they began touring in the United States, performing at festivals such as the A3C Festival in Atlanta. They released periodic singles as well, and in November 2010 they debuted the song \"Miss the Show.\" In early 2011 they taped and released a music video for \"Kick'n It\", a track first included on The Better Party. Soon afterwards they released the single \"Opium\", which they would later film a music video for. The group self-released two albums in 2011: Mad Men in April, and Good News in December.\nThey released their track \"The F Bomb\" on June 4, 2012. The song would later be included on a 2014 album and was made into a music video. \"Machete\", a single produced by 808 Mafia, was self-released by EarthGang on February 10, 2013, shortly before the release of their music video for their 2012 single \"Fire Kicking Tree Limbs\". In March 2013 the group released \"UFOs\", a slow single over nine minutes long. According to a review in Pigeons and Planes, \"Sexual, contemplative, sprawling, and slow, EarthGang's 'UFOs' veers far left from the duo's last music expedition 'Machete' and hews a bit closer to the earthy soul that typified so much mid-'90s Dungeon Family output.\" They again performed at the A3C Festival in early 2013, also opening for Black Fest at Stanford University.\n\n\n=== 2013–2016: Shallow Graves for Toys and Strays With Rabies ===\nOn July 8, 2013, EarthGang released their album Shallow Graves for Toys on the imprint Spillage Village. The album includes several singles released earlier, such as \"The F Bomb\", \"UFOs\", and \"Machete\". \"The F Bomb\" was produced by Hollywood JB of Spillage Village. The album was re-released on iTunes in the summer of 2014. In response to Shallow Graves For Toys, in 2014, Noisey called EarthGang \"an engaging, clever rap duo\", praising the album's \"playful delivery and biting lyricism\" and calling it \"one of the most well thought-out releases of the year.\" Since the album, EarthGang has released several official music videos from the album. In the summer of 2014, the video for \"The F Bomb\" was released. On September 20, 2014, EarthGang began supporting a 40 date tour with their collaborator Ab-Soul, a member of Top Dawg Entertainment. \nOn February 26, 2015, EarthGang released a 7 track EP called Torba with track titles for each day of the week.

We pay attention to details.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nOlu (aka Johnny Venus) – born Olu Onyemachi Dakarai Fann on October 9, 1989\nWowGr8 (aka Doctur Dot) – born Eian Undrai Parker on October 25, 1990\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Collaborative albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n==== Other charted songs ====\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\n\n=== Headlining ===\nNever Had Shit Tour (with JID) (2017–18)\nWhat On Earth Tour (2019)\nWelcome to Mirrorland (2019–20)\nBiodeghettable (2022)\n\n\n=== Supporting ===\nThese Days Tour (Ab-Soul) (2014)\nGO:OD AM Tour (Mac Miller) (2015)\nToo High To Riot Tour (Bas) (2016)\n4 Your Eyez Only Tour (J.

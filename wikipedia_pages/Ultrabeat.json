With a common interest in late-1990s happy hardcore music, the group decided to enter studio for recording sessions. Initially, their productions were bootleg versions of old happy hardcore tracks recorded in order to improve their DJ sets. In 2002 Ultrabeat produced their first remixes and the first record by the group was a double A-side 12-inch single \"Sonic Burnin'\"/\"Boomcore\" released on  label BCD Records in January 2003. The Ultrabeat name originated from Scottish DJ group Ultrasonic and Boomcore’s let the beat go boom line. Di Scala was previously a member of Rezonance Q, who had chart success with their cover of \"Someday\" by Mariah Carey. Di Scala played his record label Ultrabeat's demo of \"Pretty Green Eyes\", a cover of Force & Styles, and following this they were also signed by the label.\n\n\n=== 2003–2007: Ultrabeat: The Album era ===\n\"Pretty Green Eyes\" went on to peak at Number #2 on the UK Singles Chart in August 2003, behind \"Breathe\" by Blu Cantrell featuring Sean Paul. It was playlisted on most radio stations including BBC Radio 1, and was performed live on Top of the Pops. The following single was \"Feelin' Fine\" which peaked at number twelve on the UK Singles Chart in December 2003. Their next release was \"Better Than Life\", which was issued the following year and peaked at number twenty three on the UK Singles Chart.\nTheir next single, \"Feel It with Me\", was released ten months after \"Better than Life\", and peaked at number fifty five on the UK Singles Chart in 2005. An album (originally titled Better than Life: The Album) was expected to be released around this time, although this never materialised.\nIn 2005, vocalist Rebecca Rudd joined the group. Her first track with Ultrabeat titled \"Elysium (I Go Crazy) which sampled Scott Brown's \"Elysium\", reached #38 in the UK charts. \"Elysium (I Go Crazy)\" was played on TV music channels more frequently than \"Feel It with Me\" and was voted number one on MTV's 'Galaxy Chart'.\nTheir sixth single was a collaboration with Darren Styles, \"Sure Feels Good\", and was released in August 2007. It peaked at number fifty one on the UK Singles Chart. It was the second single featuring Rudd and along with \"Elysium (I Go Crazy)\" was the second collaboration with another hardcore artist. In September 2007 the band released their album, Ultrabeat: The Album, which peaked at number eight on the UK Albums Chart.

Their seventh single, \"I Wanna Touch You\", was released on 4 February 2008.\n\n\n=== 2008–present: The Weekend Has Landed era ===\nA new single \"Discolights\" was released in June 2008.

It peaked at number twenty three on the UK Singles Chart. The second single from the album was Never Ever, which did not achieve a peak on the UK Singles Charts.\nThe third single was Starry Eyed Girl, which, like the majority of the album, did not achieve a peak on the UK Singles Chart, and the fourth is Use Somebody, a cover of Kings of Leon's track from their multi-platinum album Only by the Night. The album was released on 26 October 2009 and includes 18 tracks plus a chronology DVD of all of their music videos, including Pretty Green Eyes, Feelin' Fine, The Stalker, Discolights and more.\nFollowing The Weekend Has Landed album, Ultrabeat released three singles, \"Bring It Back\", \"You Will See\" and \"Rising\". A new song \"Rain Stops\" appeared on Clubland X-Treme Hardcore 9 in 2013.\n\n\n=== Other projects ===\nThe group produced a track called \"Pumpanola\" using the alias Hi-Flyerz which appeared on Clubland X-Treme in 2003.

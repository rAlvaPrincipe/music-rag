    "text": "Those Manic Seas were an indie rock band based in Richmond, Virginia, known for their unique 'lead-singer' and interactive live performances.'\nThe band's music was composed and performed by Medley (drums), Jones (keys, theremin) and Rollo (guitar, synths, piano), while the lyrics were written and sung by “Kilroy” — an android, by all intents and purposes, comprising the body of a mannequin with a functional TV for a head. Those Manic Seas' sound would evolve from a dark, lo-fi, dance-punk into a heavily lush and semi-orchestrated post-rock, with an aptitude for melodious experimentation and theatrical stage performances. The instrumentation consisted of vocals, electric guitar, keyboards/synths, drums and an array of other instruments including piano, horns, strings, and electronic elements.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history (Headache/Heartache EP (2010-2013) ===\nInitially, Those Manic Seas began as a project by drummer Daniel Medley in early 2010.

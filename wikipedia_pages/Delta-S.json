    "text": "Delta-S is a Christian industrial/progressive trance band formed in Camarillo, California, United States in 1995. Band members currently include Lyte, who writes and produces a bulk of the work, and Lucien, who tests the material's emotional value and authenticity.\n\n\n== History ==\nDelta-S was initially formed in 1995 by artists Moe and Lyte, under the name Entropy. Later that year, the band changed their name to Delta-S. The name refers to a change in entropy (Delta So), and conceptually refers to the band's attempts at speeding up, slowing down, or stopping the process of entropy in the listener. In 1996, Jim Prosser joined the band. Work began on the production of their first album, including some collaboration with the band Calcutta and artists Duke and Joshua Vosper. The album was never released, and Delta-S disbanded in 1998.\nAfter disbanding, Lyte continued the project as a solo effort. In 1999, production for the second Delta-S album, And Sometimes..., began. This album was also unreleased. In 2000, the band adopted a new member, Lucien, and work started on a third album, Chasm. This was released as the band's debut album in March 2005, under a created record label entitled WindM Records, titled Chasm (Volume 0). The album was later re-released as Chasm (Volume 1) in May that year.\nThe band released a second album, Voyage to Isis, in December 2007. The album featured several guest vocalists including Kirsty Hawkshaw and Sheri Shaw of Deitiphobia.\nThe band's third album, The Mortal Veil, was released on October 31, 2015. This was followed by the extended plays Lost in You, featuring Jennifer Lauren (Emoiryah) and released on October 31, 2017, and Coven, released on December 22, 2017.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nBrian \"Lyte\" Judy – vocals, keys, guitar\nRobert \"Lucien\" Morris – guitar, vocals\nColleen Kelly – vocals\nDJ Amanda Jones – vocals\nNicki Tedesco – bass, upright bass, vocals, guitar\nTony Bandos – drums\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nMichael \"Moe\" Masingale\nJim Prosser\n\n\n=== Collaborators ===\nKirsty Hawkshaw\nChristina Novelli\nPamela Vain\nDJ Type 41\nLauren Edman\nSheri Shaw\nNikki Williams\nMichelle Averna\nEver\nAnguidara\nTranquil Chaos\nDavid Pataconi\nEmoiryah\nLAKE\n\n\n== Discography ==\nChasm (2005, WindM Records)\nVoyage to Isis (2007, WindM Records)\nThe Mortal Veil (2015, WindM Records)\nLost in You (2017, WindM Records)\nMirror Dimension Series Vol. 1: Coven (2017, WindM Records)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nAutomata 9.0 (2006, Flaming Fish) – \"Rage Into Blindness\" \nAutomata 10.0 (2006, Flaming Fish) – \"Tempest\" \n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n2007: Celldweller – \"Frozen\" (Fade to Grey Mix by Delta-S)\n2007: Celldweller – \"Frozen\" (Anomaly Mix by Delta-S)\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\n2014: Delta-S & Christina Novelli – \"Alive\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDelta-S website\nDelta-S Myspace page\nAutomatapedia article on Delta-S Archived 2007-05-04 at the Wayback Machine\nDelta-S SoundClick artist page"

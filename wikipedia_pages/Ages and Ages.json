    "text": "Ages and Ages is an American rock band from Portland, Oregon.\nThe group was included as Portland‘s 2011 Best New band by Willamette Week. \nIn 2011 they signed a record deal with Partisan Records and were dropped from the roster in 2017. \nIn 2013 the band changed their name from AgesandAges to Ages and Ages.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAges and Ages was formed in 2009, founded by Tim Perry (vocals, guitar), Rob Oberdorfer (bass, percussion, vocals), Graham Arthur Mackenzie (percussion, vocals), Kate O'Brien-Clarke (violin, percussion, vocals), Lisa Stringfield (vocals, percussion), Liz Robins (vocals, percussion) and Daniel Hunt (drums, percussion, vocals), alongside others from Portland's music community. Only two original members remain. \nThe group previously drew \"significant sonic influence from his religious upbringing\" and from having seven members helps achieve a \"congregation sound\" even though the lyrics are basically secular thematically. \nIn 2011, they released a video for the song \"Navy Parade,\" which was directed by Alicia J. Rose. Alright You Restless was produced by Kevin Robinson. In 2014 the band released the album Divisionary which was produced by Tony Lash.\nIn August 2016, Ages and Ages released their third record Something to Ruin on Partisan Records. The album was recorded at Isaac Brock's, Ice Cream Party Studios with the Modest Mouse front-man adding guitar to the track \"So Hazy\". Ages and Age's emphasis on featuring electronic and synthetic sounds makes Something to Ruin a departure from their previous albums.\nThey haven’t released anything new since 2019.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs & Singeles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

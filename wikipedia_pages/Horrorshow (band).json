Horrorshow, together with Spit Syndicate, Jackie Onassis and Joyride, are members of One Day collective. Horrorshow are recognised as pioneers of the sub genre known as \"Aussie hip-hop,\" alongside Illy, Drapht, the Herd, Bliss n Eso, and Hilltop Hoods.\nHorrorshow has appeared at major Australian music festivals, including the Big Day Out, Splendour in the Grass and Groovin' the Moo.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2006–2011:The Grey Space and Inside Story ===\nAfter signing with the Elefant Traks label, the pair released their debut album The Grey Space, an album created largely during the duo's high school years, at a time where they linked up with Spit Syndicate and Joyride to form the extended One Day crew. Elefant Traks artist and co-founder Urthboy explained the duo's recruitment in a blog post published in the lead-up to the release of Horrorshow's third album:\n\nWhen Horrorshow brought me The Grey Space I deduced that they were fans of Atmosphere. They wouldn't put \"Walk You Home\" on it, making the better decision to keep it for their unfinished second album, despite my wishes at the time. The first \" we wanna join the Elefants \" conversation I had with them took place on the balcony at our studio/office at the time in Enmore. I remember telling them that the only way Elefant Traks could develop was if the likes of Horrorshow took the possibilities opened up by The Herd and amplify them.\nThe Grey Space was nominated for an award at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009. The band completed tours with The Herd, Muph & Plutonic and Hermitude.\nAfter the release of their debut followed their second album Inside Story in 2009, which was acclaimed amongst their fans for its eloquent lyricism and soulful production.

On 22 December 2012, a confirmation of the third album's 2013 release was posted on the group's Facebook fan page. In early May 2013, another song \"Unfair Lottery\" was released on the Internet and received radio airplay. The song was made officially available in a digital format on 24 May 2013 and appears on Horrorshow's third album.

The music video for \"Unfair Lottery\" premiered on Channel V's \"WTF\" programme on 5 June 2013.\nThe band revealed the name of their third album King Amongst Many on 13 June 2013, following the rapid sale of tickets for the \"Unfair Lottery\" single launch shows.

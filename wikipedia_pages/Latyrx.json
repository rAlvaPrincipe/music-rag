    "text": "Latyrx is an American alternative hip-hop duo consisting of Lateef the Truthspeaker and Lyrics Born. The partnership grew from the Solesides collective at the University of California, Davis.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe crew’s charter members — including DJ Shadow and the future Blackalicious team — were all involved in student radio and shared a progressive-minded approach to hip-hop. Lateef and Lyrics Born initially recorded as solo artists under the name Asia Born; the latter released the first single on the Solesides label, “Send Them,” in early 1993.\nThe first proper Latyrx release came in 1996 and was the B-side of Lateef’s solo single “The Wreckoning.” For the track in question, also called “Latyrx,” both MCs recorded completely different raps played back simultaneously. More solo sides followed that year — Lateef cut “The Quickening (The Wreckoning, Pt. II)” with DJ Shadow on the boards, and Lyrics Born produced his own 12” release, “Balcony Beach” b/w “Burnt Pride.” Most of these solo sides and a raft of new material, appeared on the duo’s debut LP, The Album, released in 1997.\nDJ Shadow produced four tracks, Chief Xcel (later of Blackalicious) helmed two, while Lyrics Born handled the rest himself. The Album earned rave reviews for its adventurous, electronic-flavored production and the distinctive flows of both rappers. It was followed closely by the Muzapper's Mixes EP, which contained the single “Lady Don’t Tell No.” Muzapper’s Remixes appeared in 1998, but the Album didn’t stay in print much longer; it was reissued briefly in 1999 before disappearing. Meanwhile, Solesides was reconfigured into a new label, Quannum Projects, and the collective officially changed its name to Quannum. Latyrx did not record much following their brief reign as an underground sensation. They appeared on “8 Point Agenda,” a 1999 single by The Herbaliser, and also contributed new material to the Quannum Spectrum compilation that year.\nQuannum Projects finally reissued The Album in 2002, allowing it to take its place alongside the new crop of independent hip-hop, including El-P's Def Jux crew, Anti-Pop Consortium, and Anticon. Lateef and Lyrics Born went on to successful solo projects, the former with Blackalicious’ Chief Xcel and Fatboy Slim. Lyrics Born released two successful solo albums on Quannum Projects before signing in 2006 to Epitaph Records.\nLyrics Born announced on his website in February–March 2007 via a podcast that a new Latyrx album would see light after his next solo project. The Album was finally released in 2013 and was entitled The Second Album. It was released on Latyramid Records to mixed reviews.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums\n\nThe Album (1997)\nThe Second Album (2013)\nEPs\n\nThe Muzapper Mixes EP (1997)\nDisconnection (2012)\nRemix albums\n\nThe Muzapper Mixes (1997)\nCompilations\n\nLatyrical Madness Volume 1 (2012)\nLive albums\n\nLatyrx: Live at Google (2012)\nSingles\n\n\"Lady Don't Tek No\" (1997)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSoleSides site\nOfficial Quannum (formerly Solesides) site\nOfficial Lyrics Born site"

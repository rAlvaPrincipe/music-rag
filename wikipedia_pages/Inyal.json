He noted that it was \"peppered with soaring soundscapes that help give it an almost cinematic feel\" and that it confidently blended elements of Scottish traditional music, electronica, and hip-hop. Alex Monaghan wrote for FolkWorld that the band \"seem to focus on a dance club sound, strong beats and softer melodies, lots of alien noises and distortion without the harshness of metal music\".\n\n\n== Band members ==\nRobbie Greig – fiddle\nHamish Macleod – electronics, keyboards, guitar\nConal McDonagh – uilleann pipes, whistle\nOwen Sinclair – drums, percussion\nJosie Duncan – vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\nINYAL (2018)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

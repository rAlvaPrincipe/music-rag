Formed in Orange County, California, United States, in 2011, the ensemble has released several albums and toured extensively.  Their 2021 album, Shine a Light on Me Brother, was described by one reviewer as their \"best album to date which is saying a lot. It's a great album from start to finish\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe quintet began their journey in February 2011 in Orange County, California, United States. Within six months of their formation, Robert Jon & the Wreck had undertaken a national tour playing 60 shows and self-released their debut album, Fire Started. In 2013, the band released an EP, Rhythm of the Road, which was produced by Warren Huart and had been recorded at the Swing House Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Robert Jon & the Wreck were named 'Best Live Band' at the 2013 Orange County Music Awards. In mid 2014, in between touring commitments, the band recorded a second EP, The RedBull Sessions, at RedBull Studios in Santa Monica, California. Less than six months later, Robert Jon & the Wreck recorded again, this time at the Sunset Sound Studios in Hollywood, with record producer Warren Huart once more in attendance. They amassed a ten track collection, Glory Bound, which was released on February 24, 2015. \nIn 2016, Huart helmed their next album, Good Life Pie, with the recording taking place at Hybrid Studios in Santa Ana, California. Good Life Pie was issued on May 13, 2016. By this stage the band were touring both the United States and parts of Europe on a regular basis, returning periodically to California to record.  In 2017, they recorded Robert Jon & The Wreck, and reissued their earlier EPs into a compilation album, Wreckage: Vol.1.  In addition that year, line-up changes took place with Henry James (Schneekluth) and Warren Murel both joining the band.  The ensuing European trip included their appearance at the Moulin Blues Fest in Ospel, Netherlands. Their self-titled album was finally released in May 2018.\nIn May 2019, the band issued their next studio album, Take Me Higher, which had been conceived and written with the new members, Henry James and Warren Murrel. Their subsequent touring schedule took in the Ramblin' Man Fair in the UK alongside headliners Foreigner, and the Keeping The Blues Alive at Sea Mediterranean Blues Cruise in the company of Joe Bonamassa, Peter Frampton, Eric Gales, and Robert Randolph and the Family Band.\"About\".

The album featured backing singers Mahalia Barnes, Jade MacRae and Juanita Tippins. \"Tired Of Drinking Alone\" was one of 11 self-penned tracks making up the collection. The release warranted a favorable mention in Rolling Stone, and the single release from the album, \"Oh Miss Carolina\", had a three month tenure on Planet Rock Radio in the UK. By this stage the band membership had settled as Robert Jon Burrison (lead vocals/guitar), Andrew Espantman (drums/background vocals), Steve Maggiora (keyboards/background vocals), Henry James (lead guitar), and Warren Murrel (bass guitar). Their next studio album was Shine a Light on Me Brother, which was released on September 3, 2021. It received critical acclaim.

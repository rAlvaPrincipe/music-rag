    "text": "David & Carr is a duo consisting of trance musicians Peter \"Petrogad\" Carr and David \"Wes\" Johnson.  Born and raised in Minnesota, Peter \"Petrogad\" Carr began listening to electronic music at the age of 16. Soon after, he decided to delve deeper into the world of trance, quickly becoming familiar with mainstream DJs. He attended his first event later that same year, and he was hooked. Before long, Carr was the proud owner of two new CDJ's and a beat-up mixer, playing non-stop until finally, he made the plunge to vinyl. Beginning with house parties, Carr's skill quickly spread, both on his college campus and on the airwaves as a regular on internet radio stations such as ETN.fm, progressing from his campus to gigs around the town of Duluth. Petrogad teamed up with David \"Wes\" Johnson in the Fall of 2006 to start what would be known as David & Carr.\nDavid \"Wes\" Johnson came onto the dance scene just as epic trance swept the world at the beginning of a new millennium, with his style of hard trance becoming noticed. David's early work was quickly signed to many early-known trance labels, including Moonshine Records and Flashtraxx. As his music progressed, he refined his production talent, becoming known as an anthem trance producer. Despite his production skill and musical talent, David was very familiar with DJing. Starting at the age of ten, he always had a passion for the music and quickly becoming one with the turntables. David has hosted hundreds of radio shows across the country and around the world.\nIn June, 2007 Mr. Sam and Black Hole Recordings released \"Opus\", which includes Everyday by David & Carr feat. Jenna Colaizy.\nIn 2008 David & Carr released The Sessions Selections (Mixed by David & Carr), their first mix album, exclusively featuring tracks from Alter Ego Records. This release is a massive 40-track two-hour trance and progressive journey\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nDavid & Carr opened for TiÃ«sto at Myth in Minnesota on August 22, 2007.

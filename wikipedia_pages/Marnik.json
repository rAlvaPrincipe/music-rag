Marnik's version of the track generated controversy as many commentators felt it was inappropriate and disrespectful towards the Italian partisans struggle.\nOn March 18, 2022, Marnik released \"Stop the World\" with Leony and Steve Aoki. The track later appeared on Aoki's seventh studio album, Hiroquest: Genesis, released on September 16.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The National Youth Orchestra of Wales (NYOW, Welsh: Cerddorfa Genedlaethol Ieuenctid Cymru) is the national youth orchestra of Wales, based in Cardiff. Founded in 1945, it is the longest-standing national youth orchestra in the world.\n\n\n== Organisation ==\nThe orchestra numbers around 115 young players aged between 13 and 22 years who are auditioned and drawn from all over Wales, and who represent some of Wales' most talented young musicians.\nThe NYOW has performed in St David's Hall (Cardiff), the Bridgewater Hall (Manchester), the National Concert Hall (Dublin), Waterfront Hall (Belfast), Town Hall (Birmingham), Sage Gateshead, Beethovensaal (Stuttgart), the Salle Erasme (Strasbourg) the Konzerthaus am Gendarmenmarkt (Berlin), and La Mortella on the island of Ischia.\nMany Welsh composers have been commissioned to write new works for the orchestra, such as Grace Williams, David Wynne, Daniel Jones, Arwel Hughes, former member Karl Jenkins, and founder member of the orchestra Alun Hoddinott. (Two dozen pairs of clogs were needed for the Orchestra's premiere of Karl Jenkins' Scenes From Wales in 2000).\n\n\n=== Conductors ===\nThe NYOW has traditionally appointed a resident Principal Conductor and Musical Director. These have included Clarence Raybould (1945–1966), Arthur Davison (1967–1990), Elgar Howarth (1991–1995), Christopher Adey (1996–2002), and Owain Arwel Hughes (2003–2010). 2011's concert series was conducted by Takuo Yuasa.\nCarlo Rizzi (2012), Grant Llewellyn (2013), Jac Van Steen (2014), and Paul Daniel (2015). Carlo Rizzi returned for the 2016–2018 season. American conductor, Andrew Litton, conducted the 2019 concert series.\n\n\n=== Courses ===\nA residential course is normally held in the summer, followed by a short tour comprising four or five concerts. \nKnown to its members as the \"NASH\" the annual residency offers a valuable opportunity for talented musicians to work together with top professionals in an intensive environment, culminating in a series of concerts. Since 2013, a young composers course has run alongside the orchestra's summer residency, giving composers the opportunity to have their music played by members of the orchestra. Works are composed during each residency which are then given their first performances at venues including The Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, Aberystwyth University and in 2015 in the performing foyer spaces at Sage Gateshead and St David's Hall Cardiff.\nSince 2001, the National Youth Orchestra of Wales and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales have worked together on projects culminating in joint concerts or recordings, giving young players the opportunity to play alongside some of the best orchestral players in Britain.\n\n\n=== Auditions ===\nCandidates are accepted for audition on the approval of their county Head of Music Service and are expected to support music activity at school/college and county level. The minimum standard for all instruments (except harp) is Grade VIII. Harpists may play at Grade VI.  \nAuditions take place throughout the autumn around Wales and at selected centres in England for those studying away from home.\n\n\n== History ==\n1945 Orchestra founded by Irwyn Walters\n1946 First concert at the Rolls Hall, Monmouth\n1948 First appearance at the National Eisteddfod where the first recordings were made for future broadcasting\n1953 First broadcast to the Commonwealth to mark the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth\n1955 The NYOW appeared at the Edinburgh Festival\n1956 First record launched by Qualiton Records\n1957 First concert tour abroad\n\n\n== Repertoire ==\nVaughan Williams' A London Symphony featured in an all British-programme in 2008, alongside the Celtic Dances of Welsh composer, William Mathias.

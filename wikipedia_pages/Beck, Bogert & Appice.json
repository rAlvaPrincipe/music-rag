    "text": "Beck, Bogert & Appice was a rock supergroup and power trio formed by English guitarist Jeff Beck, evolving from the Jeff Beck Group. It included bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice, Americans who had played together in Vanilla Fudge and Cactus.\n\n\n== History ==\nBeck had been keen to work with Tim Bogert and Carmine Appice after encountering the two in 1967 and after subsequent meetings and sessions such as those which took place between July 6 and 10, 1969. In early August 1969, Beck commented to Alan Smith from New Musical Express:\n\n\"...two name faces to join the group. They're going to be news when they happen, and if I only had the griff on it, if only I had it signed and sealed, I'd tell you. But until then I'm afraid it's all sham. You see, both these name faces are under recording contracts at the moment.\"\nOn September 13, 1969, Melody Maker reported in its \"Raver\" column that Beck had added Carmine Appice and Tim Bogert to his band. Beck and his manager Peter Grant arranged to finalize contracts with Bogert and Appice in November 1969. On November 12, 1969, Beck crashed his car, and all future plans were put on hold. Beck soon recovered from his accident, and in early March 1971, he formed the Jeff Beck Group.\nThe official demise of the second Jeff Beck Group was announced on July 24, 1972. On the next day Jeff Beck met with keyboardist Max Middleton, Tim Bogert and Carmine Appice. He also brought in Kim Milford as vocalist. Rehearsals at the Rolling Stones' rehearsal rooms in Bermondsey began in preparation for an imminent tour of the U.S., originally arranged for the Jeff Beck Group. In an interview with Danny Holloway from New Musical Express on July 8, 1972, Beck stated:\n\n\"We've never played what the people wanted to hear in America. They expect vicious, violent rock and roll. That's what I'm known for, but I was avoiding all that in the previous band. I was trying to play subtle rock and roll. That stuff was more suitable for clubs, not big stages. This new group will play much heavier music.\"\n\nOn August 1, 1972, the band appeared at the Stanley Theater in Pittsburgh as Jeff Beck Group. After only six appearances, Milford was replaced by Bobby Tench, who was flown in from the UK after the performance at the Arie Crown Theatre in Chicago, and who appeared with the band for the rest of the tour. The tour concluded at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle on August 19, 1972. After this U.S. tour, Tench and Middelton left the band and Beck formed a power trio with Appice and Bogert. Drummer Appice took the role of vocalist with help from Bogert and Beck. Still billed as Jeff Beck Group, the trio was included on the bill for Rock at The Oval (held at The Oval) on September 16, which marked the start of a tour schedule of the UK, Netherlands, and Germany. On Friday October 20, 1972, a U.S. tour began at the Hollywood Sportatorium in Florida and concluded on November 11, 1972, at The Warehouse in New Orleans.\nBeck, Bogert & Appice started work on its eponymous debut album Beck, Bogert & Appice at Chess Studios on December 11, 1972, with sessions continuing until December 22. Recording sessions resumed on January 2, 1973, with producer Don Nix, and the trio transferred to The Village in Los Angeles. Don Nix told John Tobler from the magazine ZigZag: \"I don't know how I got the job, but I'd sure like to get out of it\". The album was released in the U.S. on March 26, 1973, and on April 6 the same year in the UK. It reached No. 12 on the U.S. album chart and No. 28 on the UK album chart on May 10, 1973. James Isaacs, from Rolling Stone wrote:\n\n\"The band's debut LP is surprisingly docile, when compared to their live show that summons recollections of the Fudge's savage version of \"Shotgun\" united with Beck's swooping leads. Always a master of unrestraint, Jeff is often subdued here, depending far less on the sound effects and whooshing runs that dominated the two albums with Rod. Good drummer Appice is the designated singer on the remainder of the tunes. While he can at least carry a tune (even if at times he sounds like he's carrying it in a satchel), his [Jack] Bruce-like tenor possesses little flair and scant individuality. Still, it's good to hear stripped-down rock like \"Lady\", with its Creamy vocal and Whoish crescendos, the boogie lick-trading on \"Livin' Alone\" and the almost ludicrous sincerity with which Carmine renders Curtis Mayfield's \"I'm So Proud\".\"\nOn February 1, 1973, the trio embarked on a UK tour that took in concert halls and university campus venues, and ended at the Top Rank in Cardiff on February 18, 1973. On February 20, the group appeared on the French TV show Pop Deux in front of 2,000 fans. On March 28, 1973, the band started its U.S. tour at the Music Hall, and Beck unveiled a new effect by using the Talk box for the first time. The trio finished the first part of its tour on April 16, 1973, at Winterland in San Francisco, having played 18 venues. After another tour break the band resumed its tour of the U.S., starting at the Seattle Center Arena on April 26 and finishing at the Honolulu International Centre on May 8; it flew on to a Japanese tour which started at Nippon Budokan on May 14 and ended five days later on May 19, 1973, at Koseinenkin Hall in Osaka.\nA tour of Europe started on July 8, 1973, and took in the annual European rock festival circuit. The group traveled to venues in West Germany and the Netherlands, then arrived in Paris to conclude the tour on July 14, 1973. Another U.S. tour hastily was arranged to cover the East Coast and Southern states, such as Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, Maryland, and Georgia. The tour started on July 11, 1973, and came to an abrupt end when Beck left on July 17.\nLive in Japan was released on October 21, 1973. This album was a compilation of performances recorded in Osaka during the May tour in Japan. On November 21, 1973, the band traveled to France to start its second European tour as Beck, Bogert & Appice. After a Christmas break, the band started a British tour, which began at Newcastle on January 10. Fourteen shows followed, taking them to Brighton, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield, Bristol, London, Glasgow and Edinburgh. The tour ended on February 29 at the Caley Picture House in Edinburgh.\nOn January 26, 1974, the band played at the Rainbow Theatre as part of a European tour. This concert was broadcast in full on the U.S. show Rock Around the World on September 9, 1974. This was the last recorded work by the band, and previewed songs intended for a second studio album were included on the bootleg At Last Rainbow. A medley with \"You Shook Me\" and \"BBA Boogie\" was included on the Jeff Beck compilation Beckology (1991). Recording sessions for a second studio album began in January 1974. On May 18, 1974, New Musical Express wrote \"Rumours concerning an imminent split in BBA, which have been rife for several weeks, were confirmed by bassist Tim Bogert\". Melody Maker also reported the breakup of the band at that time. The band dissolved before the completion of a second studio album.\n\nAt Last Rainbow song list\n\n\"Laughin' Lady\" (5:53)\n\"Lady\" (7:05)\n\"Morning Dew\" (12:22)\n\"Superstition\" (6:07)\n\"(Get Ready) Your Lovemaker's Comin' Home\" (7:40)\n\"Blues De Luxe – You Shook Me\" (5:34)\n\"Rainbow Boogie\" (11:32)  [\"BBA Boogie\"]\n\n\n== Musicians ==\n\n\n=== Band members ===\nJeff Beck – guitar, occasional vocals\nTim Bogert – bass guitar, lead and backing vocals\nCarmine Appice – drums, lead and backing vocals\n\n\n=== Vocalists ===\nKim Milford 6 live shows.

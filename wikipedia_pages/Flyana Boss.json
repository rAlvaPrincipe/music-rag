    "text": "Flyana Boss is an American hip hop duo from Los Angeles, California consisting of rappers Bobbi LaNea Tyler and Folayan Omi Kunerede. They signed to Atlantic Records in 2021, and their song \"You Wish\" gained popularity online in 2023.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early years and formation ===\nBobbi LaNea Taylor and Folayan Omi Kunerede met while attending the Musicians Institute on Hollywood Boulevard in California, where they formed Flyana Boss. Bobbi LaNea is from Detroit, MI. Folayan is from Dallas, TX. The group name is a play on the name of singer and actress Diana Ross. They were signed to Atlantic Records in July 2021 after their record label, Vnclm_, made a joint venture with Atlantic.\n\n\n=== Boffum EP and TikTok success (2023-present) ===\nTheir extended play, Boffum, featuring the songs \"Nu Nu\" and \"Really Really\", was released in February 2023. They released their extended play Make It A Double, which consisted of the songs \"You Wish\" and \"Trashboi\", in June 2023. \"You Wish\" went viral after soundtracking a series of videos recorded by Flyana Boss' videographer, Evan Blum, of the duo running through various locations—including Walt Disney World, the Santa Monica Pier, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame—which the duo began posting on their TikTok account in June 2023. When the repetitive nature of their TikTok content for “You Wish” came under criticism by fans in early July 2023, Missy Elliott came to their defense, stating that it was an \"old school tactic\" and changing things up often \"confuses\" people. The duo opened for Janelle Monáe's \"The Age of Pleasure Tour\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n==== Folayan, as solo featured artist ====\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\n\n=== Headlining ===\nThe Bosstanical Garden Tour (2024)\n\n\n=== Supporting ===\nJanelle Monáe – Age of Pleasure Tour (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nFlyana Boss at Amazon Music"

    "text": "The Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir is an internationally renowned, Grammy-winning musical ensemble that performs modern arrangements of traditional Bulgarian folk melodies. It is most recognized for its contribution to Marcel Cellier's Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares (The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices) project. First created by Georgi Boyadjiev in 1952 as the Ensemble for Folk Songs of the Bulgarian Radio, the choir is now directed by Dora Hristova. It was granted the name Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares by Marcel Cellier in 1997, in recognition of the fact that it had contributed most of the songs on the original compilations.\n\n\n== Membership and methods ==\nSingers are chosen from country villages for the beauty and openness of their voices, and undergo extensive training in the unique, centuries-old singing style. Influenced by Bulgaria's Thracian, Bulgarian, Ottoman and Byzantine history, their music is striking in its use of diaphonic singing and distinctive timbre, as well as its modal scales, unusual meters (such as 7/8, 9/8, and 11/8), and dissonant harmonies (abundant second, seventh, and ninth intervals). All of these are characteristic of Bulgarian folk music.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1951, Filip Kutev and Maria Kuteva founded the first professional national folk music ensemble in Bulgaria, the State Ensemble for Folk Song and Dance, now known as the Filip Kutev Ensemble. The State Television Choir followed in 1952. Though the latter choir became widely known when the trend-setting English alternative record label 4AD reissued a pair of anthology albums in 1986 and 1988 with the now famous title Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, their recordings date as far back as 1957. The first pressing of the Voix Bulgares album was the result of 15 years of work by Swiss ethnomusicologist and producer Marcel Cellier and was originally released in 1975 on his Discs Cellier label. Ivo Watts-Russell, the founder of the 4AD Records label, was introduced to the choir by a third- or fourth-generation audio cassette lent to him by Peter Murphy of the band Bauhaus. He became entranced by the music, and tracked down and licensed the recordings from Cellier. They were one of four choirs to appear on the album Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, Volume Two, This album won Cellier a Grammy Award in 1989. The group has since performed extensively around the world to wide acclaim. In the late 1990s, the choir became known in the U.S. for its contributions to the music of Xena: Warrior Princess, whose theme music Joseph LoDuca developed from \"Kaval sviri\", one of the Bulgarian folk songs that form the bulk of their repertoire.\n\n\n== Trio Bulgarka ==\nThree prominent soloists of the group have also performed together as Trio Bulgarka, known in the West primarily for singing on the Kate Bush albums The Sensual World and The Red Shoes. The trio also performed with the Italian rock band Elio e Le Storie Tese on the single Pipppero from the album İtalyan, rum casusu çikti, and has released two albums of its own. The three women in the trio are Stoyanka Boneva from Pirin, Yanka Rupkina from Strandja and Eva Georgieva from Dobrudja.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1975 Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, Compilation, Disques Cellier\n1987 Cathedral Concert (Live), PolyGram (re-released in 1992)\n1988 Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, volume II, Disques Cellier\n1989 Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, volume III, Disques Cellier\n1993 From Bulgaria with Love: the Pop Album, Rhino/Atlantic\n1993 Melody Rhythm & Harmony, Rhino/Atlantic\n1994 Ritual, Nonesuch/Elektra\n1995 Box Set: Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, volumes I - II and Ritual, Nonesuch/Elektra\n1998 Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, volume IV, Philips\n2001 Bulgarian Custom Songs, Gega\n2003 A Portrait of Nikolai Kaufmann, Riva Sound / KVZ Music Ltd.\n2008 Music From Alone in the Dark, composed by Olivier Derivière, Milan Records\n2017 Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares ft.

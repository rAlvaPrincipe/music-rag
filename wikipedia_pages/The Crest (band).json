    "text": "The Crest was a gothic metal/darkwave band from Oslo, Norway noted for their gothic metal with catchy melodies, massive guitar sound, and a soothing female voice. The band was formed in 1996 by Nell and Kristian Sigland. After going through changes in name and line-up, the band settled on the name \"The Crest\" in 1999, after recording their second demo when they started to develop their characteristic sound.\nIn 2001, The Crest recorded their first full album, Letters from Fire, in Sound Suite Studio, together with Terje Refsnes, the producer of Tristania, Carpathian Forest, and The Sins of Thy Beloved.\nIn 2003 the band took a sabbatical to regain energy for their next album. Nell and Kristian spent time on a side project named \"Rustflower Incorporated\", experimenting with electronic music. Also in 2006, Nell replaced Liv Kristine as Theatre of Tragedy's vocalist.\nThe Crest reunited in 2004 and recorded their second album, Vain City Chronicles, at the Top Room Studio in Norway. The album features, according to the band, \"a heavier, more guitar-based side of the band, while still focusing on the characteristic melancholic melodies and of course Nell's soothing voice.\"\nIn October 2010, Nell and Kristian stated that The Crest has split up to enable other projects.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nLast Known Lineup\nNell Sigland - vocals, keyboards (also member of Theatre of Tragedy)\nKristian Sigland - guitars, vocals, keyboards, programming\nMagnus Westgaard - bass, vocals\nStian Kilde Aarebrot - guitars\nKlaus Blomvik - drums\nFormer\nDavid Husvik - drums (1996–2001)\nXander Sevon - drums (2002–2004)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nLetters from Fire (2002)\nVain City Chronicles (2005)\n\n\n=== Demos ===\nMost of these demos ended up on the band's first release Letters from Fire.\n\n\"Straightjacket Singalongs\" – Demo (1998)\n\"Childhood's End\"/\"Thorn\" (1999)\n\"Thunderfuel\" (1999)\n\"Dark Rock Armada\" (2000)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Crest at AllMusic"

It was co-founded by Gabriel Levine and Scott Levine Gilmore of Black Ox Orkestar. The theater's work consisted of Toy theater shows based on revolutionary history, performed in Canada, the U.S., France, and Spain.

This tour included a performance at the Palestinian National Theatre in Jerusalem as part of the 13th international Puppet Festival, in September 2005. The alt.theatre journal described their work as \"activist puppet theatre ... using history to rekindle revolutionary flames and tackle contemporary social issues.\"\nAlso in 2005, Le Petit Theatre de l’Absolu performed as part of the 7th Toy Theatre Festival, held at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York.

    "text": "The xx are an English indie rock band from Wandsworth, London, formed in 2005. The band consists of Romy Madley Croft (guitar, vocals), Oliver Sim (bass guitar, vocals), Jamie Smith, also known as Jamie xx (beats, MPC, record production), and formerly Baria Qureshi (keyboard, guitar). They are known for their distinctive minimalist sound blending indie rock, indie electronic, indie pop, dream pop and electro-rock and the dual-vocalist set-up of Madley Croft and Sim. Their music employs soft echoed guitar, prominent bass, light electronic beats and ambient soundscape backgrounds.\nThe band was formed when Madley Croft and Sim met during their time at Elliott School, with Baria Qureshi joining the same year and Smith in the following year. After posting demos on their Myspace page, they drew the attention of the Beggars Group-owned label Young Turks (now Young). Working with producer Rodaidh McDonald, the band released their debut album, xx, in August 2009. The album was a commercial and critical success, reaching number three on the UK Albums Chart, ranking first for The Guardian's and second for NME's best of the year lists among others, and winning the Mercury Prize in 2010. After their debut, Qureshi left the group. Their second album, Coexist, was released on 5 September 2012 to positive reviews, reaching number one in the UK and number five on the Billboard 200. After a four-year lapse between releases, including Smith's solo debut in 2015, In Colour, the band released their third album, I See You, on 13 January 2017, which debuted to critical acclaim and reached number one in the UK and number two on the Billboard 200.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2005–2009: Formation ===\nThe band members met while studying at Elliott School, the same school attended by Hot Chip, Burial, Four Tet, actor Pierce Brosnan, Fleetwood Mac founder Peter Green and singer Matt Monro. The group has downplayed the influence of the school on its career: \"A teacher from Elliott who had never even taught us said how great we were. It's a bit annoying. We were left alone, more than anything – although I'm sure that helped us in its own way.\" Oliver Sim and Romy Madley Croft (born 1989) started the band as a duo when they were 15. Guitarist Baria Qureshi joined once it began performing in 2005, with Jamie Smith, also known as Jamie xx, joining a year after. Smith, although schoolfriends with Madley Croft, Sim and Qureshi, joined the band after being formally introduced by their now label, Young Turks (now Young).\n\n\n=== 2009–2011: xx and Qureshi's departure ===\n\nThe xx's debut album xx was released on 14 August 2009 through the British independent record label Young Turks,\nand was met with critical acclaim. The album ranked on best of the year lists, ranking ninth on the Rolling Stone list and second for NME. In the 2009 NME The Future 50 list, the xx was positioned at number six, and in October 2009, it was named one of MTV Iggy's \"Top 10 Bands with Buzz\" (at the CMJ Music Marathon 2009). \"Crystalised\" was featured on iTunes (UK) as Single of the Week, starting from 18 August 2009.\nThough the band had previously worked with producers including Diplo and Kwes, Smith produced xx and co-mixed with Rodaidh McDonald. The xx recorded its first album in a small garage that was part of the XL Recordings studio, often at night.\nIn August 2009, the band headlined its own concert tour. The xx has toured with artists including Friendly Fires, The Big Pink, and Micachu. In January 2010, Matt Groening chose the band to play at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival which he curated in Minehead, England. In addition, the band played at five music festivals in the United States, Coachella, Sasquatch, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits.\n\nIn late 2009, second guitarist and keyboardist Baria Qureshi left the group. Initial reports stated that this was due to exhaustion, but Oliver Sim later said that the rest of the band had made this decision: \"Also to be fair to her, people have an idea about that she left the band. She didn't. It was a decision that me, Romy, and Jamie made. And it had to happen.\"\nThe music of its debut album was used extensively on television and in the media, such as 24/7, Person of Interest, NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games; during the series Cold Case, Suits, Mercy, the Greek version of Next Top Model, Bedlam, Hung, 90210, as well as being the feature song for the March 2010 E4 advert for 90210, Misfits, the Karl Lagerfeld fall/winter 2011 fashion show, Waterloo Road, and the film I Am Number Four. In May 2010, the track \"Intro\" was used by the BBC in its coverage of the 2010 general election. This led to the band playing the track on an episode of Newsnight. The track was also played before the UEFA Euro 2012 and UEFA Euro 2016 matches at stadiums in Poland, Ukraine, and France and featured during the end of Top Gear season 19 episode 6 \"Africa Special Part 1\". Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and Sander van Doorn's 2012 single \"Project T\", which launched the Tomorrowland 2012 aftermovie, contains samples from \"Intro\"; van Doorn had earlier released a remix of the song in 2010. The song was also sampled in Rihanna's \"Drunk on Love\" from her album Talk That Talk and was featured in the films It's Kind of a Funny Story and Project X.\nIn September 2010, xx won the Mercury Prize. After the live ceremony screening, the album jumped from 16 to 3 on 12 September UK album chart, accompanying a 269% sales increase. XL's marketing campaign drastically expanded after this substantial win, with day-time TV advertisements and billboard campaigns on some of the UK's highest-profile digital billboards. Thanks to the highlighted publicity, XL Recordings says that it shipped more than 40,000 CDs in the days following the Mercury Prize. XL managing director Ben Beardsworth explained, \"Thanks to the Mercury win... things are accelerating dramatically and the band will be reaching a bigger and bigger audience with their music.\" In another promotional initiative, the label sent out Saam Farahmand's audio/visual sculpture of the album when the band toured at Bestival 2010, as well as to an event at Seoul.\nThe xx was nominated for 'Best British Album', 'Best British Breakthrough' and 'Best British Band' at the 2011 BRIT Awards held on 15 February 2011 at the O2 Arena in London, although it did not win in any of the categories.\n\n\n=== 2011–2012: Coexist ===\nIn December 2011, Smith revealed that he wanted to release the xx's second album ahead of its festival appearances the following year, and that it was inspired by \"club music\". \"The majority of stuff I'm working on now is the xx stuff. We're just about to start recording. Hopefully we'll get it done in time for most festivals next year, because that's the most fun.\" Discussing the sound of the album, he said: \"We've all come back off tour and been partying a bit more. We left when we were 17 and we missed out on that chunk of our lives when everyone else was partying. Club music has definitely had an influence on the next record.\"\nOn 1 June 2012, it was announced that the follow-up, Coexist, would be released on 10 September. On 16 July 2012, it announced and released \"Angels\" as the lead single from Coexist.

Its first North American tour started on 5 October in Vancouver, Canada, with dates throughout the US and Mexico.\n\n\n=== 2013–present: Touring, side projects, and I See You ===\nIn 2013, the xx held a series of three festival-style concerts, called \"Night + Day\", in Berlin, Lisbon, and London. The festivals featured performances and DJ sets curated by the band, including Kindness and Mount Kimbie. Each festival culminated in a nighttime concert by the band. The band was nominated for a Brit Award for Best British Group, eventually losing out to Mumford & Sons.\nIn April 2013, the xx contributed the song \"Together\" to the official soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of The Great Gatsby.

The band members have cited several artists in their influences. Madley Croft said: \"Jamie started out very much into soul and then from there moved into hip-hop and UK-based dance music. He brings some much lower frequencies of bass into the band. And then I've grown up listening to Siouxsie and the Banshees, and The Cure. We're really quite a huge melting pot of different stuff.\" She also had mentioned her liking for Jimi Hendrix, The Slits, Joy Division, Yazoo, Eurythmics and New Order.

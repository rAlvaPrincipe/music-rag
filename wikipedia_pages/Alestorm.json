    "text": "Alestorm are a Scottish heavy metal band formed in Perth, Scotland in 2004. Their music is characterised by a pirate theme, and as a result, they have been dubbed a \"pirate metal\" band by many critics and their fanbase. The group currently consists of lead vocalist/keytarist Christopher Bowes, bassist Gareth Murdock, drummer Peter Alcorn, keyboardist/harsh vocalist Elliot Vernon and guitarist Máté \"Bobo\" Bodor.\nAfter signing to Napalm Records in 2007, their debut album Captain Morgan's Revenge, was released on 25 January 2008. Black Sails at Midnight, the band's second album, was released on 27 May 2009. The band's third album, Back Through Time, was released on 3 June 2011. The fourth album from the band, Sunset on the Golden Age, was released in August 2014. Their fifth album No Grave But the Sea was released on 26 May 2017. Their sixth album, Curse of the Crystal Coconut, was released on 29 May 2020. Their seventh and most recent album, Seventh Rum of a Seventh Rum was released on 24 June 2022.\nThe band has also released one live album and five EPs. The lead vocalist Christopher Bowes provides the announcer voice for the Pirate team in the video game Pirates, Vikings and Knights II.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Battleheart and origins (2004–2007) ===\nThe band was founded in 2004 in Perth, Scotland as Battleheart, a studio project by Christopher Bowes and Gavin Harper. Originally intended as a standard power metal band, the success of song \"Heavy Metal Pirates\" convinced the band to permanently adopt a pirate theme and incorporate folk metal elements into their music. Gavin and Christopher recorded and released two demos in 2006, which were received well by the local metal community. The band began to perform live in 2006, with a lineup consisting of Bowes (vocals and keytar), Harper (guitars), Dani Evans (bass) and Doug Swierczek (drums). Doug Swierczek eventually left the band later that year and was replaced by Ian Wilson. After a period of inactivity, in late 2007 Battleheart sent the aforementioned demos to Napalm Records. The band was quickly offered a record deal.\n\n\n=== Captain Morgan's Revenge (2007–2009) ===\n\nAfter being signed by Napalm Records, the band changed their name from Battleheart to Alestorm. Their debut studio album, Captain Morgan's Revenge, was released in early 2008. The album featured the drummer of the band Incubator, Migo Wagner as the session drummer. The album was also produced by Incubator guitarist Lasse Lammert.\nIn April 2008, the band released the single \"Heavy Metal Pirates\". They also played the UK festival Bloodstock, alongside headliners Nightwish and Dimmu Borgir. Drummer Ian Wilson left in June 2008 and later rejoined in August of the same year. By September 2008, original guitarist Gavin Harper had left the band. Tim Shaw was Harper's replacement, but after a brief period of touring, was fired from the band. To fill the guitarist position, Dani Evans switched instruments from bass to guitar, and Gareth Murdock of Waylander joined as the replacement bassist.\n\n\n=== Black Sails at Midnight and Back Through Time (2009–2011) ===\nThe band's second studio album Black Sails at Midnight was released in May 2009. The album peaked at #60 on the GfK Entertainment charts. In March 2010, Ian Wilson left the band and was replaced with a new drummer named Peter Alcorn. Alestorm's third album, Back Through Time, was Alcorn's first appearance on an Alestorm album.\nOn June 3, 2011 Alestorm went on a Back Through Time World Tour starting in Australia and New Zealand. The album reached #42 on the German Albums Chart. In October 2011, Elliot Vernon joined the band as keyboard player and also performed screamed / death metal vocals.\n\n\n=== Sunset on the Golden Age and No Grave But the Sea (2012–2019) ===\nThe band released their fourth record entitled \"Sunset on the Golden Age\" on 1 August 2014, reaching the #1 position in the UK Rock Chart.\nDani Evans retired from the band in April 2015, and was replaced by Hungarian guitarist Máté Bodor of the band Wisdom, who is also a part of Leander Kills.\n\nIn October 2016, Christopher Bowes announced during a concert on the Super Smashed Turbo Tour that the band planned to begin recording a fifth studio album in January 2017. The fifth record, entitled \"No Grave But the Sea\", was released on 26 May 2017. The album peaked at #1 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers Albums chart.\n\n\n=== Curse of the Crystal Coconut and Seventh Rum of a Seventh Rum (2020–present) ===\nOn 8 January 2020, the band announced the title of their sixth studio album, \"Curse of the Crystal Coconut\". This was released on 29 May 2020. On 30 April, the band released an EP titled, \"The Treasure Chest EP\". Prior to the album's release, Alestorm released the singles \"Treasure Chest Party Quest\" on 2 April 2020, \"Tortuga\" (feat. Captain Yarrface of Rumahoy) on 23 April 2020, and \"Fannybaws\" on 14 May 2020. The fourth single for the album titled, \"Pirate Metal Drinking Crew\" was released on 29 May 2020. The album peaked at #68 on the Official Albums Chart. A deluxe version of the album includes the normal track listing, along with what is referred to as \"16th Century Version\" editions of each track was released. On 6 August, The Wooden Box was released and it included two bonus tracks on a 7-inch Single which are \"Big Ship Little Ship\" and \"Bassline Junkie\". On 28 May 2021, the band released their second live album, \"Live in Tilburg\".\nIn August 2021, a Twitter account named \"GloryhammerC\" posted screenshots of what appeared to be an internal chat from 2017 between the members of the band Gloryhammer, of whom vocalist Chris Bowes was a keyboardist and founding member,  that showed misogynist and racist humour along with several racial slurs. Bassist Vincent Jackson Jones of Aether Realm, who formerly collaborated with Bowes in the band Wizardthrone, released a statement on 26 August 2021, in which he distanced himself professionally from Bowes and urged Bowes to make his own statement; at the time, none of Gloryhammer's members had made public comments on the issue. Subsequently, Aether Realm, who were due to tour with both bands, were replaced with the Bootyard Bandits. On 5 September 2021, Bowes and the rest of the band released statements, admitting the leaked chat was true and apologizing for the remarks.\nOn 16 January 2022, the band announced that they entered the studio to record their seventh studio album, Seventh Rum of a Seventh Rum. On 31 January 2022, the band released a music video for the song \"Zombies Ate My Pirate Ship\", a song from their sixth album, \"Curse of the Crystal Coconut\". On 13 March 2022, the band announced that their seventh studio album will be released on 24 June 2022. On 6 April 2022, the band released the lead single, \"Magellan's Expedition\". On 4 May 2022, the band released the second single, \"P.A.R.T.Y.\". On 1 June 2022, the band released the third single, \"The Battle of Cape Fear River. On 22 June 2022, the band released the fourth single, \"Seventh Rum of a Seventh Rum\".\n\nIn June 2022, the band was criticised by several sources  for playing a gig in Tel Aviv due to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. After a fan messaged them on social media explaining they could not attend the gig due to Israeli checkpoints, the band responded the fan should, 'come and drink RUM,' [sic]. This led to some  accusing the band of downplaying the seriousness of the situation and white-washing Israeli crimes.\nOn 17 September 2023, the band announced an upcoming EP titled \"Voyage of the Dead Marauder\", set to be released in 2024. On 14 November 2023, the band announced the release date for the EP, setting the release for 22 March 2024. On 14 February 2024, the band released a new song, \"Voyage of the Dead Marauder\", the lead single from the EP. The EP featured two cover versions. On 21 March 2024, the band released a new song, \"Uzbekistan\", the second single from the EP.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\n\nAlestorm is generally classified as  pirate metal, folk metal, power metal and heavy metal.

    "text": "The Charlotte Symphony Orchestra is an American orchestra based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The orchestra’s principal home is the 1,970-seat Belk Theater of the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center. The official chorus of the orchestra is the Charlotte Master Chorale. The orchestra also serves as the resident orchestra for Opera Carolina and Charlotte Ballet. The Symphony Park amphitheater at SouthPark is home to the orchestra’s Summer Pops concerts.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Spanish conductor and composer Guillermo S. de Roxlo founded the orchestra in 1932, with an initial ensemble of 15 musicians.  The orchestra gave its first concert on 20 March 1932 at the Carolina Theatre, with a total ensemble of 57 musicians.\nRichard Cormier was the first full-time music director of the orchestra, from 1963 to 1967.  The orchestra's longest-serving music director was Leo Driehuys, from 1977 to 1993.  From 2001 to 2010, Christof Perick was music director, and the orchestra released its first compact disc during Perick's tenure, in 2007, with music of Beethoven, Schubert, Mahler, and Mozart.  In July 2009, the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra launched a bridge fund campaign at its “Celebrate America” concert in Charlotte’s Symphony Park, with a goal of raising $5.6 million to cover projected budget gaps over a six-year period. This fund is separate from the Symphony’s annual operating budget of $7.6 million. As of February 2010, the CSO had raised $4.3 million toward the bridge fund goal.  Following the close of his tenure, Perick had the title of conductor laureate for the 2010–2011 season.\nThe orchestra's most recent music director was Christopher Warren-Green, who held the post from 2010 to 2022.  Upon the close of his tenure as music director, Warren-Green took the title of conductor laureate and artistic advisor.\nIn January 2023, Kwamé Ryan first guest-conducted the orchestra.  Ryan returned for an additional guest-conducting engagement in November 2023.  In December 2023, the orchestra announced the appointment of Ryan as its next music director, effective with the 2024-2025 season, with an initial contract of 4 years.\n\n\n== Music directors ==\nGuillermo de Roxlo (1932–1944)\nGuy Hutchins (1945–1948)\nLamar Stringfield (1948–1949)\nJames Christian Pfohl (1949–1957)\nHenry Janiec (1958–1963)\nRichard Cormier (1963–1967)\nJacques Brourman (1967–1976)\nLeo Driehuys (1977–1993)\nPeter McCoppin (1993–2000)\nChristof Perick (2001–2010)\nChristopher Warren-Green (2010–2022)\nKwamé Ryan (2024–present)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nCharlotte Symphony, \"An Orchestra is Formed in Charlotte\".

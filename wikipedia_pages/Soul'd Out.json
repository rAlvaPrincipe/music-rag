    "text": "Soul'd Out (usually styled as SOUL'd OUT) was a Japanese hip-hop trio, consisting of Diggy-MO' (MC), Bro.Hi (MC/Beatboxer), and Shinnosuke (DJ). Their name is a portmanteau of \"soul\" and \"sold out\", and the group is sometimes referred to by their initials, S.O.  On 30 January 2014, the group announced on Facebook that they would disband after their final album, To From, was released on 9 April 2014.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Diggy-MO' ===\nDiggy-MO' was the group's lead vocalist and track co-producer. He was classically trained on piano from the age of 10 and participated in a band in his school days. While he attended a university of fine arts with a major in graphics, he regardless pursued a career in music.  Outside of his work as a rapper, Diggy-MO' has also worked as a singer, particularly so in his solo works.\nDiggy-MO' launched his solo career around the time of Soul'd Out's initial hiatus. His first single, \"Bakusou Yume Uta\" (released on 26 November 2008), was used as the third ending theme of the anime Soul Eater. His first solo album, Diggyism, was released on 25 March 2009. Furthermore, his solo single \"Stay Beautiful\" (released on 12 May 2010) was used as the 23rd ending theme of the anime series Bleach. \n\n\n=== Bro.Hi ===\nBro.Hi was the beatboxer for the group while also writing lyrics and serving as an MC. He had previously played drums in a band while at middle school, but gained interests in lyricism from Jim Morrison and in beatboxing from having seen The Roots live.\nAround the time of Soul'd Out's hiatus, Bro.Hi formed the band EdgePlayer, a band which fuses rock with DJ work for the sake of club performances. The band's first full album, Twisted, was released on 28 July 2010.\n\n\n=== Shinnosuke ===\nShinnosuke served as the track producer for Soul'd Out alongside Diggy-MO'. He furthermore has experience in writing lyrics, as well as arranging and remixing music for other artists. As a child, he participated in a band in his own by playing on keyboards. He has served as a track producer since his time as a high schooler, at which time he was inspired by the band Jam & Lewis. Around the time of Soul'd Out's hiatus, he launched his solo project \"S'capade\", releasing an album under the same name on 9 June 2010.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSoul'd Out - released 27 August 2003\nTo All Tha Dreamers - released 2 February 2005\nSecond closing theme for anime series Yakitate!!

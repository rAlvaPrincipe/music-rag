    "text": "Gåte (pronounced [ˈɡôːtə]; Norwegian for 'riddle') is a band from Trøndelag, Norway playing Norwegian folk music bred with metal and electronica. Their style has been referred to as progressive folk-rock. The band was put together by Sveinung Sundli (violin, keyboards) in 2000 and originally consisted of his younger sister Gunnhild Sundli (vocals), Gjermund Landrø (bass, backing vocals), Martin Langlie (drums) and Magnus Børmark (guitar, keyboards). Langlie was replaced by Kenneth Kapstad in 2004. They represented Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 with the song \"Ulveham\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band released their first EP, Gåte EP in 2000, and rapidly gained popularity. A second EP, also self-titled, was released in 2002. Their first album, Jygri, released the same year, proved to be their commercial breakthrough both in Norway and abroad, particularly in Scandinavia and Germany. They also gained a lot of media attention, particularly the distinctive voice of Gunnhild Sundli caught the interest of music journalists, who immediately started to speculate on her departure in order to establish a solo career. After the release of another EP, Statt opp (Maggeduliadei) in 2003, and their second album, Iselilja in 2004, the band announced that they were taking a break. In their press release, issued September 6, one of the reasons cited was that Gunnhild wanted to devote time to other pursuits. Nevertheless, their record company Warner Music Norway issued a live album, titled Liva, in 2006 which had been recorded at the Rockefeller Music Hall the previous year, and with bonus material from their concert at the Roskilde Festival in 2003. Gåte made a comeback in 2017 with the EP Attersyn, followed by the album Svevn in 2018.\nDuring the first part of their career they toured extensively and played almost every popular music festival in Norway, as well as the major international festival Roskilde Festival in Denmark. The band reunited for one concert in 2009, but then decided to follow this up with a mini-tour of Norway consisting of five concerts in 2010. The fifth concert was held at the roof of the Oslo Opera House, and the band stated that this would be their final farewell. In 2018, they started touring Norway again.\nIn August 2023, Gåte announced that Sveinung was temporarily leaving the band and would not participate in the upcoming tour.\nThe band took part in Melodi Grand Prix 2024, the Norwegian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024, with the song \"Ulveham\". They qualified from their semi-final on 20 January 2024 and ultimately won the final on 3 February 2024.\nAt Eurovision 2024, Gåte finished 10th in the second semifinal on 9 May, qualifying them for the Grand Final on 11 May, where they finished 25th.\n\n\n== Song origins ==\nMany of Gåte's songs are rearranged versions of traditional Norwegian folk tunes, such as \"Sjå Attende\" (the title translates to \"Look Back\"), and \"Knut Liten og Sylvelin\" (\"Little-Knut and Sylvelin\"). Another main source of Gåte songs are poems by the Norwegian poet Astrid Krog Halse with added music by Sveinung Sundli, such as \"Følgje\" (\"Company\") and \"Stengd Dør\" (\"Closed Door\"). Some of their songs were written in Nynorsk/Landsmål and performed in a broad Trøndersk dialect.\nOn \"Svevn\", several songs have lyrics by veteran folk musician Knut Buen, who also wrote the lyrics to \"Kjærleik\" on \"Iselilja\".\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Gunnhild Sundli ===\n\nGunnhild (born 2 July 1985) is the band's lead vocalist and joined the band in 1999.

She studied singing at Heimdal Upper Secondary School.\n\n\n=== Magnus Børmark ===\nBørmark (born 21 November 1982) is from Trondheim. He learned to play guitar and piano from his older brother. He has played in popular rock bands, such as Torch, before joining Gåte in December 2000. He plays a Fender Telecaster, Robotcaster and Les Robot, the last two being made by Frank Stavem.

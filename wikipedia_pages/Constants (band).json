    "text": "Constants is an American post-rock / shoegaze band from Boston, Massachusetts, United States.\n\n\n== (2004) Nostalgia for the Future ==\nConstants was originally formed as a three piece in 2003, consisting of Will Benoit, Ben Fowlie, and Duncan Rich. Their first album Nostalgia for the Future, was produced by Daryl Rabidoux (The Cancer conspiracy) with production assistance by multi-platinum producer Matt Squire.  After the release of \"Nostalgia for the Future\" on Radar Recordings in 2004, Fowlie left the band to found The Camden International Film Festival, and was replaced by bassist Orion Wainer in 2005.\n\n\n== (2006) The Murder of Tom Fitzgerril ==\nThe band self-produced their follow up EP The Murder of Tom Fitzgerril and began touring in a 66-passenger bus converted to run on waste vegetable oil.  Joined on the road by guitarist Jon Hassell (ex-Seneca), the band toured for 10 months straight in 2006, and became a strong proponent of sustainability and green touring.  Constants was spotlighted in newspapers and on TV news programs nationwide for their veggie oil fueled 10-month tour.  Originally, the album was released in limited hand numbered sleeves with metallic inks, and was later repressed and re-released in a jewel box.\nIn 2007, Duncan Rich left Constants to pursue a business degree and founded the booking agency Bunce Booking, while Jon Hassell joined the band full-time. Rob Motes (ex-Coma Recovery) moved to Boston from Albuquerque, NM to take over on drums. After releasing a split 7-inch with Caspian in the Spring of 2008, guitarist Jon Hassell left to focus on film-making in Brooklyn, NY, and the band has carried on as a trio since.\nThe Murder of Tom Fitzgerril was released on CD by Radar Recordings, and on vinyl by Vega Vinyl on June 20, 2008, on 180 gram vinyl in a gatefold jacket.\n\n\n== (2009) The Foundation, The Machine, The Ascension ==\nThe band released a three album set in June 2009 on three different labels worldwide.

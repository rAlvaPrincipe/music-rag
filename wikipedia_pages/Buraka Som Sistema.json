They were interested in creating a kuduro project, and had previously worked together as 1-UIK Project. They met Carvalho, a hip-hop producer from Angola and member of the hip-hop band Conjunto Ngonguenha, while he was in Portugal.\nBuraka Som Sistema is the Portuguese word for word translation for Buraka Sound System, keeping the English word order (the correct translation would be \"Sistema de Som da Buraka\").

The track was a precursor to their second album, Black Diamond, which was released in 2008 by Sony BMG, followed by a new single, \"Kalemba (Wegue Wegue)\", with vocals by Pongolove. They are currently signed on to Aftercluv Dance Lab, a Latin EDM label launched by Universal Music.\nOn 1 July 2016 Buraka Som sistema curated Globaile, a music event at the Torre de Belém grounds, as part of the Festas de Lisboa, where they performed their last concert.\n\n\n== Usage in media ==\nTheir song was featured in EA Sports video game such as \"Kalemba (Wegue-Wegue)\" featuring Pongolove in FIFA 10 and \"Restless\" in 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa. \"Hangover (Ba Ba Ba)\" is also featured in the video game Just Dance 2016.

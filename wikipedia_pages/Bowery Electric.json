    "text": "Bowery Electric was an American band formed in New York in 1993 by Lawrence Chandler and Martha Schwendener. They released three albums between 1995 and 2000, including the critically praised Beat (1996).\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed by Lawrence Chandler and Martha Schwendener in late 1993, Bowery Electric played their first show in New York City in January 1994. The band's debut double 7-inch single was recorded by Kramer and released by Hi-Fidelity Recordings in 1994. After listening to it, Kranky contacted the band.\nThe band's first album, Bowery Electric, was recorded by Michael Deming at Studio .45 in Hartford, Connecticut and released by Kranky in 1995. The album was included by Andrew Earles in his 2014 book, Gimme Indie Rock: 500 Essential American Underground Rock Albums 1981–1996. In 2016, Pitchfork named it the 36th best shoegaze album of all time.\nIn 1996, the band released their second album, Beat. It includes the single \"Fear of Flying\". In 2016, Beat was reissued on vinyl as a 20th anniversary edition by Kranky.\nVertigo, a remix album of tracks from Beat, was released in 1997. Vertigo featured a roster of artists including Third Eye Foundation, Robert Hampson, Witchman and others.\nIn 2000, the band released an album, Lushlife, which was recorded at Electric Sound. The album peaked at number 14 on the CMJ Top 200 chart and number 11 on the Core Radio chart.\nThey have not performed or released any recordings as Bowery Electric since.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe band blended elements of shoegaze with trip hop rhythms, utilizing samplers, laptop production, and dub bass. In the November 1995 issue of The Wire, Simon Reynolds credited Bowery Electric and other kindred groups as developing \"a distinctively American post-rock\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBowery Electric (Kranky, 1995)\nBeat (Kranky, Beggars Banquet Records, 1996)\nLushlife (Beggars Banquet Records, 2000)\nDemo (Independent, 2024)\n\n\n=== Remix albums ===\nVertigo (Beggars Banquet Records, 1997)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nDrop (Hi-Fidelity Recordings, 1994)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Fear of Flying\" (Beggars Banquet Records, 1997)\n\"Without Stopping - Witchman Mix (Hell or High Water Dub)\" (Beggars Banquet Records, 1997)\n\"Coming Down - Immersion Mix\" (Beggars Banquet Records, 1997)\n\"Blow Up\" (Happy Go Lucky, 1997)\n\"Floating World\" (Beggars Banquet Records, 2000)\n\"Freedom Fighter\" (Beggars Banquet Records, 2000)\n\n\n== Use of songs in media ==\n\n\n=== Advertisements ===\n\"Beat\" was used in commercials for Puma and Michelin\n\n\n=== Films ===\nAll We are Saying (\"Deep Sky Objects\", \"Freedom Fighter\")\nMade in Britain (\"Looped\", \"Low Density\")\nThe Mothman Prophecies (\"Under the Sun\")\nThe Princess and the Gangster (\"Lushlife\")\nTransworld Skateboarding Anthology (“Fear of Flying”)\nTransworld Skateboarding Sixth Sense (“Fear of Flying”)\nTransworld Skateboarding Modus Operandi (“Shook Ones”)\n\n\n=== Television ===\nBehind the News (\"Freedom Fighter\")\nCKAL News at Noon (\"Fear of Flying\")\nComic Relief (\"Low Density\")\nDeepwater Black (\"Fear of Flying\")\nGardners from Hell (\"Low Density\")\nIdeal (\"Over and Over\", \"Slow Thrills\")\nLes histoires extraordinaires de Pierre Bellemare: Le virage d'Anna (\"Soul City\") - Season 2, Episode 18\nWNBC-TV Listen-Voices of the Future (\"Beat\", \"Fear of Flying\", \"Floating World\", \"Freedom Fighter\", \"Over and Over\", \"Saved\", \"Under the Sun\")\nMTV Real World/Road Rules Challenge (\"Deep Blue\", \"Soul City\") - Episode 406; (\"Psalms of Survival\") - Episode 416; (\"After Landing\", \"Shook Ones\") - Episode 504; (\"Deep Blue\", \"Psalms of Survival\", \"Saved\" ) - Episode 505; (\"Lushlife\") - Episode 506, Episode 916\nMoorgate Legacy (\"Beat\", \"Low Density\")\nMotorway Cops (\"After Landing\", \"Beat\", \"Fear of Flying\", \"Passages\", \"Psalms of Survival\")\nNo Disco (\"Freedom Fighter\")\nParis Modes TV (\"Floating World\") \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ambient music artists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBowery Electric on Bandcamp\nBowery Electric discography at Discogs \nBowery Electric discography at MusicBrainz"

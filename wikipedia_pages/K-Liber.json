Their single \"Viben\" was a top five hit in the Netherlands, and their follow-up \"Loungen\", featuring Michael Bryan, also had some success. Their newest release, \"Springuuuhh\", is also now beginning to receive promotion in various European countries. The single again features Bryan, along with MC Farah.

Their group name was a combination of both of their first names. The label enlisted former label-mate Tomoko Kawase to act as the girls' mentor and producer. Kawase had been a long-time musical inspiration for Amo and Ayamo. They released a pre-debut EP, Amoyamo, in August 2012 to gain publicity for the group.\nThe group's debut single, \"Let's Go Out\", was released on October 31, 2012. The song was used as the twelfth opening song for the anime television Gin Tama. The single included a cover of \"Pray\" by Tommy heavenly6, which was the original Gin Tama opening. \"Let's Go Out\" debuted at number 23 on the Oricon singles chart.\n\n\n=== Flash ===\nIn 2013, the duo parted ways with mentor/producer Tomoko Kawase. Their next single \"Live / Magic\", a double a-side, was released March 27, 2013.

    "text": "Part Chimp is an English noise rock band from Camberwell, London, that was formed by Tim Cedar, Jon Hamilton and Nick Prior in 2000.  Their current line-up is Tim (vocals and guitar), Jon (drums), Joe McLaughlin (bass), Robin Freeman (bass), and Iain Hinchliffe (guitar).\nThey play rock music with elements of noise. Both in recordings and live performances, Part Chimp have a reputation for sounding extremely loud. Their records have been released in the UK by Rock Action Records, in Europe and Japan by Play It Again Sam, and in the US by Monitor records.\n\n\n== History ==\nTim Cedar and Jon Hamilton had previously played together in Ligament.  Nick Prior (bass), formerly of Scarfo, joined Ligament for their last tour. When Ligament split, the threesome played one show as Part Chimp in late 2000, before adding Iain Hinchliffe on guitar. Nick Prior left the band in February 2004 and was replaced by Joe McLaughlin. In 2008, Tracy Bellaries (ex-Ikara Colt) joined on bass, playing on the Thriller record before leaving in early 2010.

However, Itsuka became interested in rapping after performing rapped lyrics in karaoke settings; she eventually decided that her rap skills were better than her singing skills, and decided to rap in Charisma.com. \"Charisma\" was originally a nickname Itsuka had been given by her vocalist friend.

After she receives them, she adds lyrics and a melody. Both members continue to work their jobs as office ladies in addition to being members of Charisma.com. Itsuka works at the office of a magazine, while Gonchi works at a company specialising in precision machinery. Much of Charisma.com's music is inspired by everyday happenings in offices, especially the difference between life as a musician compared to life as an office lady.\nItsuka's lyrics when she first began performing music were originally more about love, however the longer she worked as an office lady, the more she sang about society and angrier things. During Distopping, most of her songs were from the point of view of other people, including her younger sister, her coworkers or is inspired by snatches of conversation on the train.\nCritics have focused praise on Charisma.com for Itsuka's lyric style and rapping.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Promotional singles ===\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCharisma.com (January 15, 2016), Gametsuku Strong ~ dokuzetsu OL rappā, seken o buttagiru!

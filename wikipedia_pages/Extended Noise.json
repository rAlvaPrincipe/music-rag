    "text": "Extended Noise (established 1982) was a Norwegian Jazz Quintet. Their first album Keep nose in front (1984) under the name AHA was released after an acclaimed appearance at Moldejazz 1983, followed by the Extended nose album Jamaha (1986) where Alnes was substituted for Klakegg. The change of name was dued to the competition from the Norwegian pop band \"a-ha\".

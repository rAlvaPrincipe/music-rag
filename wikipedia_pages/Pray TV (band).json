The band's early sound was described as \"songs that have a lot of energy and rock along with power, yet they project this depressive mood that most bands can only get by playing slow. It's a neat trick.'\" The band had various members over the years, with the only consistent members being Aidan Halloran (vocals) and Martin Kennedy (guitar/bass). Joseph Kennedy, Martin's brother, was the drummer for most of the band's existence.\nTheir debut 7\" vinyl only single \"In My Street\", along with the 6 track, 12\" vinyl only EP Sure were released in 1989 on Mr Spaceman. Both of these releases were recorded by Perri and Bo at the Phantom Tollbooth in Carlton, Melbourne. Shortly after these releases, Kennedy joined Ascot Vale band Mr Floppy as drummer, but left shortly after. The 7\" vinyl only single \"Spent\" was released by Au Go Go Records in 1990. The 7\" vinyl only single \"Cold Dog Strew\" was released in 1991 on Shock Records and was lifted from their debut CD LP Flux of the same year.\n\n\n=== 1992–1997: Paydirt, Swinger's Paradise & Westona ===\nPray TV's second album Paydirt was released on Shock Records in 1992. The album included a bonus track of the band covering the Hüsker Dü song \"Sorry Somehow\", which was also regularly performed live. The released was followed by a series of shows in New York and Los Angeles with Radioactive label mates Live.\nIn 1992, Pray TV featured on a CD called Dress Ups (Shock Records) with other Melbourne bands, The Glory Box and The Fauves, with each band performing a track from the others repertoire, as well as contributing one original track. Melbourne band Ripe were also intended to take part but did not due to other recording commitments.\nIn January 1994, they supported The Smashing Pumpkins at the Prince of Wales in St Kilda, Melbourne. Their third album Swinger's Paradise was released on Concubine Records in 1995. It was produced by Ed Kuepper.

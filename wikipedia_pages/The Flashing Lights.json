    "text": "The Flashing Lights were a Canadian alternative rock band, active in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Flashing Lights was founded by Matt Murphy,  as a side project, performing around Halifax when Murphy was not performing and recording with the band The Super Friendz. The band primarily played as a cover band.\nThe Flashing Lights became Murphy's primary band following the Super Friendz' breakup in 1997. Murphy and bassist Henri Sangalang moved to Toronto, where they recruited Gaven Dianda on keyboards, tambourine and harmonica, and Steve Pitkin on drums. \nThe band performed in Toronto at the Horseshoe Tavern in March, 1999, and shortly after released its debut album, Where the Change Is, in April, 1999 on Halifax independent label Brobdingnagian Records, scoring a hit on modern rock radio stations in Canada with \"Half the Time\". The album's tracks were reminiscent of 1960s British rock.  They followed up with the EP Elevature in 2000; Sangalang also appeared on Neko Case's album Furnace Room Lullaby the same year, and the band appeared at Edgefest on July 1. \nThe Flashing Lights' second album, Sweet Release, was released through Toronto's Outside Music in 2001 and was produced by Thrush Hermit's Ian McGettigan. Also in 2001 they performed in Montreal with Duotang and The Datsons.\nThe band subsequently went on hiatus; Murphy reunited the Super Friendz for their 2003 album Love Energy, and then took an acting role in the film The Life and Hard Times of Guy Terrifico. He later joined the now-defunct Toronto band City Field, is currently a member of Cookie Duster, contributed a song to the soundtrack for the 2009 film Defendor, and had a small acting role in the film Leslie, My Name Is Evil.\nAs of 2015, he has joined with Mike O'Neill of The Inbreds and Chris Murphy of Sloan in the supergroup Tuns.\nDianda currently plays with the band Saffron Sect, and Pitkin played with The Violet Archers and is currently a member of Elliott Brood.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nWhere the Change Is (1999)\nElevature (2000, EP)\nSweet Release (2001)\n\n\n== References =="

In 2014, Frances Cone released a self-titled EP that streamed on Paste Magazine, which subsequently featured them in their \"Best of What’s Next\" series stating, \"You’ll hear everything from folk inspired harmonies, to driving bass drums, to grungy synths, all culminating in an arena anthem, where Cone’s roof-lifting vocals shine.\"\nIn January 2016, Frances Cone released their first single titled \"Arizona\" from their forthcoming second full-length album, Late Riser, which is set to release on January 18, 2019.

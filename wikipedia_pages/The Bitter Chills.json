They play Americana, folk rock and \"roots pop.\" Prior to the Bitter Chills, Matt Cheplic released two solo albums, Don't Let Me Lose My Mind in 2001, and Who Burned the Book of Love, in 2008. The records received airplay on public and college radio stations, and Cheplic performed around the United States. He began playing with Pietro Ciliberto, as the group Crazy Morgan. Both were teachers at Roselle Catholic High School, and Cheplic notes in an interview with Jersey Beat, that \"when I formed the band with Pete, part of the mantra for me was I wanted to do something with more of a sense of humor to it.\"\nThey released their first record, entitled Birth Of The Cold, in 2013, which is described as a low-fi acoustic album. Cheplic acknowledges inspiration for Birth Of The Cold from the music of The Beatles, Elvis Costello, Barenaked Ladies, and Johnny Cash. \n\n\n=== Mint 400 Records ===\n\nThe Bitter Chills signed with the independent label Mint 400 Records, in 2016.

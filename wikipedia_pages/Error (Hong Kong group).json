    "text": "Error (stylised in all caps) is a Hong Kong Cantopop boy band formed through ViuTV's reality talent show Good Night Show - King Maker in 2018. The group consists of 4 members: Leung Yip, Dee Ho, Denis Kwok, and Poki Ng. The group debuted on 2 December 2018 with the single \"404\".\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2018–2020: Formation and early years ===\nIn July 2018, ViuTV's reality talent competition Good Night Show - King Maker started scouting for potential artistes. After the final, 12 of the 99 contestants were selected by ViuTV to form a boy band Mirror, but the third runner-up Leung Yip (Fatboy) was not selected. Later, the television station published online a series of short videos titled Fatboy's Big Adventure (肥仔大冒險), depicting how Leung Yip recruited his fellow contestants to form another group. The final and seventh episode of the series, published on 2 December 2018, showed Leung Yip, Denis Kwok (193), Dee Ho and Poki Ng declaring the formation of Error. The group demonstrated their comedian position with their debut single \"404\", which is a parody of Mirror's \"In a Second\" (一秒間).\nIn 2019, the group released two singles, namely \"Kill My Manager\" (殺死我的經理人) and \"We Are Not Broken\" (我們不碎). They also hosted their first television show Error Crazy Trip  with their manager Ahfa Wong. In October of the same year, Error hosted their first stand-up comedy show in Macpherson Stadium. They released a single called \"Handsome Guys\" (我們很帥) the following year, which they gained their first peak chart position in RTHK.\n\n\n=== 2021–2022: Rising popularity ===\nError released two singles, \"I Promise\" and \"We Don't Chok\" (我們不Chok) in 2021. They also hosted a reality pageant show, Miss Mask Pageant  in March, and each member led a team in the contest. This drew comments from ViuTV's competitor, TVB's deputy general manager Eric Tsang, who dismissed ViuTV for its low viewership and the show for being a niche. On 11 April, before the airing of the final, Denis Kwok sarcastically rebutted Tsang's comments; it became a boost in his popularity, as well as the group's. In May, Error's reality show Error Selfish Project  was the rage in Hong Kong, the server of ViuTV's website even faced technical problems during the upload of last episode due to the traffic to the website. They were awarded \"Best Groups\" at 2021 Metro Radio Music Awards, and \"Annual Groups Bronze Award\" at Chill Club Chart Award Presentation 21/22.\nIn 2022, Error released two singles, \"Love on Duty\" (愛情值日生) and \"Never Come Back\", and they were awarded \"Best Groups\" at 2022 Metro Radio Music Awards for two consecutive years.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Television series ===\n\n\n=== Variety Shows ===\n\n\n=== Films ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nEREOR on MakerVille\nError on Instagram\nError on Facebook\nError's channel on YouTube"

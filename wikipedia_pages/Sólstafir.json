    "text": "Sólstafir is an Icelandic post-metal band formed in 1995 and currently signed to Century Media. Originally a black metal band, they transitioned to a post-metal-influenced style with slight traces of their earlier black metal.\n\n\n== History ==\nSólstafir was formed in 1995 by guitarist/singer Aðalbjörn Tryggvason, bassist Halldór Einarsson, and drummer Guðmundur Óli Pálmason. The band's name is the Icelandic word for sun beams (crepuscular rays). They soon recorded the demos Í Norðri and Til Valhallar. Halldór then left the band, and Aðalbjörn and Guðmundur recorded a promo tape as a duo in 1997.\nDuring this period, Svavar Austmann joined as the new bassist and the band began recording their debut full-length album, Í Blóði og Anda. The album was not released until 2002 due to various recording delays and label disputes. Shortly after that album was completed, second guitarist Sæþór Maríus Sæþórsson joined the band and made his debut on the 2002 demo Black Death.\nAfter shopping around a three-track demo of new songs, Sólstafir signed with Spinefarm Records in 2005. Their second album Masterpiece of Bitterness was released by Spinefarm later that year. The album received positive reviews, with Metal Storm stating \"the perfect mix of non-Metal elements with metal ones makes it a necessary album for any Metalhead looking for something that breaks the mold of pre-established genres.\"\nTheir third album Köld was recorded in Sweden and released in 2009. Reviewers compared the band's sound to Enslaved and Neurosis, among others, while noting their unique post-black metal sound. The album was also noted for its addition of atmospheric passages. Sólstafir began to tour Europe regularly in 2010 and made their first of many open-air appearances at the Roskilde Festival that year.\nSólstafir's fourth full-length album, Svartir Sandar, was released by Season of Mist in 2011. The song \"Fjara\" remained in the 2013 list of Iceland's top 100 songs of 20 years. This album signaled Sólstafir's retreat from black metal and move toward experimental atmospherics of the type practiced by fellow Icelanders Sigur Rós.\nTheir fifth album Ótta was released by Season of Mist in 2014, and was noted for its additional experimental elements like strings and piano. Three official music videos were released and the band performed Iceland's national television channel, RÚV's Stúdio Á.\nIn January 2015, the band announced that longtime drummer Guðmundur Óli Pálmason had left the band for \"personal reasons\". Guðmundur replied immediately via the band's Twitter account, explaining that he had been \"stonewalled by ex-bandmates\" and forced out of the band by Aðalbjörn Tryggvason. Guðmundur was replaced by Hallgrímur Jón Hallgrímsson.\nAfter his departure from the band Guðmundur formed post metal band Katla. \nSólstafir released their sixth full-length album, Berdreyminn, in May 2017 on Season of Mist. Upon its release Berdreyminn entered international charts, mostly top 50, across Europe.\nOn 6 November 2020, Sólstafir released their seventh studio album, Endless Twilight of Codependent Love.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nAðalbjörn \"Addi\" Tryggvason – guitar, vocals (1995–present)\nSvavar \"Svabbi\" Austmann – bass (1999–present)\nSæþór Maríus \"Pjúddi\" Sæþórsson – guitar (2002–present)\nHallgrímur Jón \"Grimsi\" Hallgrímsson – drums (2015–present, on touring hiatus 2023–2024), backing vocals (2020–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nHalldór Einarsson – bass (1995–1997)\nGuðmundur Óli Pálmason – drums (1995–2015)\n\n\n=== Former touring members ===\nAri \"Sneakers/Strigaskór\" Steinarsson – drums (2015, 2023–2024)\nKristján Einar Guðmundsson – drums (2024)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nÍ Blóði og Anda, 2002 (Ars Metalli)\nMasterpiece of Bitterness, 2005 (Spinefarm Records)\nKöld, 2009 (Spinefarm Records)\nSvartir Sandar, 2011 (Season of Mist)\nÓtta, 2014 (Season of Mist)\nBerdreyminn, 2017 (Season of Mist)\nEndless Twilight of Codependent Love, 2020 (Season of Mist)\nHin Helga Kvöl, 2024 (Century Media)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nTil Valhallar (EP), 1996\nBlack Death (EP), 2002\nÓtta (Radio Edit) + Til Valhallar (EP), 2014\nÓtta Sampler EP / Bonus: Live at Hellfest 2014 (EP), 2014\nTilberi (EP), 2016\nSilfur-Refur (EP), 2017\n\n\n=== Demos ===\nÍ Norðri (demo), 1995\nPromo Tape September 1997 (demo), 1997\nBlack Death (demo), 2001\nPromo 2004 (demo), 2004\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2011: \"Fjara\"\n2012: \"Æra\"\n2013: \"Þín orð\"\n2014: \"Ótta\"\n2024: \"Hin Helga Kvöl\"\n2024: \"Hún andar\"\n\n\n=== Splits/compilations ===\n\"Fire & Ice - An Icelandic Metal Compilation\" (Compilation), 1997\n\"Fjara/Runaway Train\" (Split with Legend), 2014\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nSólstafir at Encyclopaedia Metallum\nSólstafir discography at MusicBrainz"

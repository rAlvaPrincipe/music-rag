Their career started young when they grew up in the Sydney suburb of St. Clair, where they attended Holy Spirit Primary school and later Emmaus Catholic College in nearby Erskine Park. \nGrowing up in a musical family, it was during those early years that the two developed a love for music. However, they also had a knack for acting , which resulted in both of them television presenting and landing roles in TV commercials and soap operas. \nAt the ages of 9 and 13, Christine and Sharon joined Brent Street Studios to also study dancing. Soon after joining the school, the girls were invited to join the Brent St. Kids performance troupe and began singing and dancing all over Sydney. It was through this exposure that they attracted the attention of Tina Arena who saw their performance at the Variety Club Heart Awards. Arena mentioned the girls to her now former manager/husband.  He later signed them to his management company and new record label in 1997. \n\n\n== Musical career ==\n\n\n=== 1999–2004: One ===\nAfter relocating to Melbourne to write their first album, the name Sister2Sister was born.

    "text": "Rise Up is the 44th studio album by British pop singer Cliff Richard, released on 23 November 2018 by Vox Rock and Warner Music.  \nIt was promoted as Richard's first album of new material in 14 years following 2004's Something's Goin' On, as most of his albums since then were compilations, covers projects, or a combination of the two (with the possible exception of his 2011 album Soulicious, which contains primarily new material, with 11 original songs out of 15).\nThe album followed Richard's legal battle with the BBC, and he said of the album's title, \"I chose 'Rise Up' as the title track because after the bad period I went through in my life, I've managed to rise up out of what seemed like a quagmire\". Richard also said he hoped the album would attract a new audience: \"I could be recognised by some of these younger people to be a valuable artist. I'm not messing around with it, it's for real\". The album reached number four on the UK Albums Chart and was certified Gold.\nThree singles were released from the album. The title track, written by Terry Britten (who wrote Richard's hits \"Devil Woman\" and \"Carrie\") was released as the first lead single. \"Reborn\" was the second lead single. It was co-written by Chris Eaton, who wrote Richard's 1990 Christmas number one, \"Saviours Day\". The third single was the double A-side \"Everything That I Am\" / \"The Miracle of Love\".  \nThe album also includes Richard performing a duet with Olivia Newton-John on the track \"Everybody's Someone\", originally recorded by LeAnn Rimes and Brian McFadden.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll tracks produced by Rupert Christie; additional production by Jochem van der Saag and Jorge Vivo, except \"The Minute You're Gone\", \"Miss You Nights\", \"Devil Woman\" and \"Some People\" produced by James Morgan and Juliette Pochin and feature the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n\n== Charts and certifications ==\n\n\n== References =="

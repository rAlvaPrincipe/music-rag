    "text": "Les Violons du Roy is a French-Canadian chamber orchestra based in Quebec City, Quebec.  The orchestra's principal venue is the Palais Montcalm in Québec City.  The orchestra also performs concerts in Montréal at the Place des Arts, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and St. James United Church. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1984, Bernard Labadie founded the ensemble, following productions at the Université Laval of the Baroque operas Dido and Aeneas and L'incoronazione di Poppea, using the orchestra for these productions as the new ensemble's core.  The ensemble's name is an adaptation of the 17th century French royal court orchestra Les Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi.  Numbering 15 musicians, the orchestra performs on modern instruments, but incorporates period performance practice into its performances of music from the 17th and 18th centuries, including using duplicates of period bows for string instruments, and sparing use of vibrato.  Labadie founded an affiliate chorus for Les Violons du Roy in 1985, under the original name of Ensemble vocal Bernard Labadie.  In 1991, the choir changed its name to La Chapelle de Québec.\nThe ensemble first performed in Europe in 1988.  Its first performance in Washington, D.C. was in 1995.  The orchestra first appeared in New York City in August 1997.\nPast conductors and musicians affiliated with the ensemble have included:\n\nJean-Marie Zeitouni, a past principal guest conductor\nEric Paetkau, a former resident conductor\nMathieu Lussier, an associate conductor\nAnthony Marwood, a principal artistic partner\nWith the 2014–2015 season, Labadie's title with the orchestra changed from music director to \"founding conductor\".  In October 2016, the orchestra announced the appointment of Jonathan Cohen as its music director, effective with the 2017-2018 season.  In November 2022, the orchestra announced the appointment of Nicolas Ellis as its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2023-2024 season.\nThe orchestra has recorded commercially for the Dorian, Virgin Classics, and ATMA Classique labels.  The ensemble has won the Juno Award for Classical Album of the Year three times: for their recording of George Frideric Handel's Apollo e Dafne and Handel's Silete Venti in 2001, for their recording of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Requiem in 2003, and in 2007 for their recording of Astor Piazzolla's Four Seasons.\n\n\n== Music Directors ==\nBernard Labadie (1984–2014)\nJonathan Cohen (2017–present)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Les Violons du Roy homepage (French-language)\nOfficial Les Violons du Roy homepage (English-language)\nDavid Vernier, \"Les Violons du Roy's 24-Karat Goldbergs\", ClassicsToday.com article (undated)\nCarnegie Hall biography of Les Violons du Roy\nATMA record label biography of Les Violons du Roy\nLa Scena Musicale version of Les Violons du Roy press release on change of Labadie title (ensemble press release had no date), 8 July 2013"

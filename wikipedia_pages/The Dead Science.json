    "text": "The Dead Science (formerly The Sweet Science) was an experimental pop band based in Seattle.\nThe band consists of guitarist/vocalist Sam Mickens, Jherek Bischoff on bass and Nick Tamburro on drums. Jherek Bischoff's brother Korum was the drummer from the band's inception in 1999 through 2005. Tamburro, who'd shared drumming duties with him on the recording of Frost Giant and had previously acted as The Dead Science's touring drummer, joined permanently upon his departure. Korum is still credited on the band's label page with \"guidance, stability and sometimes drums.\"\nTheir music is heavily influenced by their training as jazz musicians and involvement in the avant-garde music of a number of artists, most notably Xiu Xiu and Degenerate Art Ensemble. Mickens has also cited Prince as an influence on his vocal style, often noted in reviews of the bands' work for its use of falsetto.\nThe trio self-released their limited run debut EP Galactose under their original moniker, The Sweet Science, before giving up the name due to a cease-and-desist order from another band. Following the name change, The Dead Science released their debut album Submariner on Absolutely Kosher Records in 2003.  This was followed by the release of their second EP Bird Bones in the Bughouse in 2004, their second album Frost Giant in 2005, and a third EP Crepuscule with The Dead Science in 2006.  They were also named winner in the 'Jazz/Experimental' category in Seattle Weekly's 2006 Music Awards.\nIn 2008, the band signed to Constellation Records, with whom they released their third album, Villainaire.\nThe band reunited in 2023 for a performance commemorating the 20th anniversary of Submariner.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAlbums:\n\n2003 Submariner (Absolutely Kosher)\n2005 Frost Giant  (Absolutely Kosher)\n2008 Villainaire  (Constellation)\nEPs:\n\n1999 Galactose (self-released, as The Sweet Science)\n2004 Bird Bones in the Bughouse (Absolutely Kosher)\n2006 Crepuscule with The Dead Science (Slender Means Society)\n7\" Records:\n\n2006 split 7-inch with Xiu Xiu (Deathbomb Arc)\n2007 split 7-inch with Sholi  (KDVS)\n2007 split 7-inch with Parenthetical Girls (Obsolete Vernacular)\n2007 7-inch Tomlab Alphabet Series: The Letter V (Tomlab)\n2008 7-inch Throne of Blood (The Jump Off) (Constellation)\nCompilation Appearances:\n\n2002 Mass Transit (as The Sweet Science) (Woodson Lateral)\n2005 YETI Magazine #3 compilation\n2007 The Second Marriage Records Compilation (Marriage)\n2008 David Shrigley's Worried Noodles (Tomlab)\nMixtapes:\n\nDate Unknown Ponies in a Stable\n2008 School Of Villainy - The Villainaire Prequel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial band site\nAbsolutely Kosher (record label)\nAbsolutely Kosher's page for The Dead Science\nAllMusic entry\nMyspace profile - downloadable and/or streaming MP3s, current tour dates."

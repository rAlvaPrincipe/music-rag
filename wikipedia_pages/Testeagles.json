    "text": "Testeagles, sometimes referred to as \"TEs\" or ''Testes'', are a three-piece rock band which formed in Adelaide, South Australia in 1994. The group is made up of brothers Matthew \"Matty\" Matt (lead guitar and lead vocals) and Adrian \"Ady\" Matt (drums), alongside Dave \"D\" Paisawa (bass guitar and vocals). D joined the lineup in 1999, replacing their original bass guitarist, Dean.\nThe group have a handful of official releases to their name, the first being the Chum EP released in 1995, which was followed by the B-Sting and Friends EPs in 1998, their first tracks to secure them Triple J airplay. In 1999, the group released singles \"Turn That Shit Up\" and \"Underdog\" from their debut album, Non Comprehendus. \nNon Comprehendus was released in February 2000 and peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart. This album, along with its singles, were also played on Triple J and gained them a much larger national following. A third single from the album, \"Like No Other\", was released in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\nTesteagles were formed as a techno rock trio in Adelaide in 1994 by Matthew \"Matty\" Matt on lead guitar and lead vocals; his brother, Adrian \"Ady\" Matt on drums; and Dean \"Deano\" Lawn on bass guitar. \nAustralian musicologist Ian McFarlane felt they \"displayed an uncanny ability to combine thudding metal/indie rock with electronic beats and samples to arrive at an intense brand of techno rock.\"\nTheir first extended play, Chum, was released in December 1995, with seven tracks, on the independent label DEF Records. They were signed by Stuart MacQueen of Adelaide-based independent label, Krell Records. During 1998 they issued two EPs, B-Sting (March) and Friends (August), on Krell.\nIn  late 1998, Deano was replaced by D Paisawa. The band were signed by Epic/Sony and issued \"Turn That Shit Up\" as their first single in July 1999. In January 2000 \"Turn That Shit Up\" was listed at No. 66 on Triple J's Hottest 100 for 1999. The single was followed by \"Underdog\" (October 1999) and \"Like No Other\".\nTheir debut album, Non Comprehendus, appeared in February 2000, which peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It was produced by Paul McKercher (You Am I, Spiderbait).\nMcFarlane described it as \"A heavy-duty mix of alterna-metal riff-rock, squalling sound effects, experimental electronic beats and samples, [it] was certainly the most visceral album to chart in the Australian Top 10 since the likes of Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson.\" Christie Eliezer of Billboard felt the album was similar to material by United States groups, Ko–Øn and Limp Bizkit.\nDue to label difficulties, the Testeagles left Sony and the independent label Krell. \nThe group were regulars at the annual Big Day Out festivals, and last appeared at the Adelaide venue in 2005. \nTesteagles' final performance, before disbanding, was at the Hi-Fi Bar in Melbourne supporting Mammal on 21 June 2008.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

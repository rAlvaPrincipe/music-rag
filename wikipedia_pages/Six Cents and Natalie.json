    "text": "Six Cents and Natalie is the sporadic side-project of Tullycraft lead singer Sean Tollefson. This lo-fi band actually predates Tollefson's pre-Tullycraft band Crayon. Six Cents and Natalie released a series of cassette tapes and 7-inch singles in the mid 1990s. Eventually, two full-length CDs were released by Black Bean & Placenta Tape Club that compiled most of the material found on the early cassettes and singles.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Cassettes ===\nWater Machine (cassette) self-released (1992)\nTressel (cassette) self-released (1993)\nLet's Pretend We're Married (cassette) self-released (1993)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nBoyfriends (7-inch) Harriet Records (1993)\nLearning To Share EP (split 7-inch)  Sudden Shame Records (1994)\nSummer's Gone But A Lot Goes On (7-inch) Burden of Joy Records (1994)\nWhen Punk Fell To Earth (7-inch ) Rubber Goldfish Records (1995)\nSix Cents & Natalie / Phlegm (split 7-inch)  Black Bean & Placenta Tape Club (1997)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nShow Me The Honey (CD)  Black Bean & Placenta Tape Club (1999)\nWhen Punk Fell To Earth (CD) Black Bean & Placenta Tape Club (2001)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nFluttered - compilation (cassette) \"Fire Walk With Me\" Big Jim Records, (1995)\nJet-Age Circuit Rider - compilation (cassette) \"Untitled\" Slabco, (1995)\nThe Long Secret - compilation (CD) \"Quilting Bee\" Harriet Records, (1995)\nCosmic Slop - compilation (cassette) \"Just One\" Paperplane, (1995)\nLa Blackbean Taqueria - compilation (LP) \"Easter Sunday\" Blackbean And Placenta Tape Club, (1995)\nChildhood Friends - compilation (cassette) \"You And Me\" Brassland, (1995)\nExtended Vacation - compilation (cassette) \"Jake Ryan\" Krebstar Records, (1996)\nChutes & Ladders - compilation (cassette) \"The Sadness Of Science\" Cactus Gum Recordings, (1996)\nWhiskey, You're The Devil - compilation (CD) \"Showgirls\" Cactus Gum Recordings, (1996)\nWish I Was... - compilation (cassette) \"Shelly\" Lil' Red Wagon, (1996)\nAs Seen On TV - compilation (CD) \"My Date With Rachel Sweet\" Spare Me Records, (1996)\nPop Machine - compilation (cassette) \"Tag\" Cowly Owl !, (1997)\nThe Storm Of The Century - compilation (CD) \"My Date With Rachel Sweet\" Sudden Shame, (1997)\nNever Kept A Diary - compilation (CD) \"Baywatch Nights\" Motorcoat Records, (1998)\nThe Sidewalk Chalk Adventure - compilation (7-inch) \"You Could Be The One\" Kittridge Records, (1999)\nKindercore Christmas Two - compilation (CD) \"Secret Santa\" Kindercore Records, (1999)\nBuild Your Own Radio - compilation (CD) \"Bessy\" Bumblebear Records, (2000)\nSweet Sweet Casio - compilation (CD) \"Devil In Your Heart\" North Of January, (2001)\nThe Way Things Change Volume 4 - compilation (CD) \"Christine, North Dakota\" Red Square, (2002)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nStrong, M.

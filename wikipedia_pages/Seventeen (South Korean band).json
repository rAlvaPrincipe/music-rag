    "text": "Seventeen (Korean: 세븐틴; RR: Sebeuntin; stylized in all caps or as SVT) is a South Korean boy band formed by Pledis Entertainment. The group consists of thirteen members: S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino. Seventeen has garnered a large audience since their debut and has grown into an internationally recognized K-pop group with signature music and performances.\nThe group debuted on May 26, 2015, with the extended play (EP) 17 Carat, which became the longest-charting K-pop album of the year in the US and the only rookie album to appear on Billboard's \"10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015\" list. The group's 2023 EPs FML and Seventeenth Heaven both set records for the most pre-ordered album in history, with FML earning the group their first MAMA Award for Album of the Year and becoming the best selling album of the year according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. \nSeventeen is considered a \"self-producing\" idol group, with the members involved in songwriting, music production, and choreographing, among other aspects of their music and performances. They perform as one group and are divided into three units—hip-hop, vocal, and performance—each with a different area of specialization. They have been labeled \"Performance Kings\", \"Theater Kids of K-Pop\", and \"K-Pop Performance Powerhouse'\" by various domestic and international media outlets.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Seventeen is derived from the expression \"13 members + 3 teams + 1 group\", representing how the 13 members are divided into three different teams and come together to form one cohesive group. The name originally referred to how 17 members (with the other 4 former pre-debut trainees — Jang Do-yoon, Samuel Kim, Shin Dong-jin, and Yao Mingming) — planned to debut.\nThe official name of Seventeen's fan club is \"Carat\" (Korean: 캐럿), as announced at a concert on February 14, 2016. Named after the measurement unit for diamonds, it is a reference to their debut EP 17 Carat and its opening song \"Shining Diamond\". Seventeen have a global fan club hosted via Weverse and a Japan-specific fan club.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2013–2015: Formation, Seventeen TV, and Seventeen Project ===\n\nBeginning in 2013, Seventeen appeared in regular live broadcasts of a series called Seventeen TV on the online streaming platform UStream. The show aired for multiple seasons, in which trainees were introduced and shown practicing for performances, with some seasons culminating with Like Seventeen concerts. Prior to their debut, Seventeen also appeared in the reality television show Seventeen Project: Big Debut Plan on MBC from May 2 to 26, 2015. The show concluded with the group's debut showcase.\n\n\n=== 2015–2016: Debut with 17 Carat, first win and first studio album Love and Letter ===\nSeventeen officially debuted on May 26, 2015, with a live showcase televised by MBC, the first male K-pop group to debut with a one-hour live showcase on a major broadcasting channel, with labelmates Lizzy and Raina serving as MCs. Three days later, Seventeen's first extended play (EP) 17 Carat was released digitally. 17 Carat became the longest-charting K-pop album of the year in the US and was the only rookie album to appear on Billboard's \"10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015\" list.\nOn September 10, Seventeen released their second EP Boys Be, which later became the highest-selling rookie album of the year. The EP's success earned the group awards at the Golden Disk Awards, Seoul Music Awards, and Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. Seventeen became the only K-pop group on Billboard's \"21 Under 21 2015: Music's Hottest Young Stars\" list. Seventeen held a four-show concert series in Seoul titled \"Like Seventeen – Boys Wish\" from December 24 to 26 as a year-end celebration. After the concerts' success, the group held two encore concerts in the following February.\nSeventeen's first studio album Love & Letter was released on April 25, 2016. In addition to success on domestic charts, the album charted on the Oricon Weekly Pop Album Chart in Japan.

The shows attracted 50,000 spectators despite the group not having officially debuted in the country. On April 1, Seventeen became the first idol group to have a second season of the show One Fine Day, filming the series during their stay in Japan. The second season was titled One Fine Day in Japan and created in collaboration between South Korean broadcaster MBC and Japanese network Music On! TV.\nSeventeen's fourth EP Al1 was released on May 22. It peaked at number one in South Korea and sold over 330,000 copies by the end of the year.

Jeonghan has released music in Japanese, with \"Dream\", an unofficial song, released in both Japanese and Korean.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Musical style ===\nSince their debut, Seventeen have been heavily involved in their creative process. Woozi has written and produced each of the band's tracks, with contribution from other members. The group's choreography has also largely been influenced by performance team leader Hoshi. This has contributed to the group's distinctive musical style, with each comeback characterized by a new sound. Woozi explained in an interview with The Korean Herald, \"Our participation ... went much further than just contributing our opinions. The leaders of the three unit groups went to every album production meeting to make sure that we could tell our own story.\"\nWith a desire to bring a new sound and style with each comeback, Seventeen has explored different genres in their music. However, despite the different genre shifts and experimental forms they take with their music, the group shares their goal is to be authentic and honest with the music they share.\n\n\n=== Lyrical themes ===\nSeventeen's self-producing nature enables them to be authentic in their music and better connect with fans. Their lyrics range from a variety of topics as self-producing allows the group to write and sing their own verses. For example, the group's hip-hop unit, composed of S.Coups, Wonwoo, Mingyu, and Vernon, often write and implement their styles into their songs. In an interview with Billboard, Wonwoo positively commented on the process: \"It adds a great extent of diversity within the track, and it's fun because we all sound very different and each have a very different [verse].\"\n\nWanting listeners to relate to their music, the group has stated their intention to show that they face the same issues and experiences that their fans encounter. Their songs cover a variety of themes, including perseverance through life's struggles, finding comfort in others' company, celebrating one's accomplishments, and reaching new heights. The group members have also admitted to pulling inspiration from everyday real-life experiences and musical role models, among others.\n\n\n=== Japanese, English, and Chinese releases ===\nAs K-pop artists, Seventeen's music and performances cater to both Korean and international audiences. In addition to their core discography, they have released Japanese songs such as \"Fallin' Flower\" and \"Not Alone\", alongside Japanese-language versions of previously released songs. In 2023, they released Always Yours, a compilation album featuring all of their Japanese releases to date. In 2024, they released 17 Is Right Here, an equivalent compilation of Korean releases which included Korean-language versions of the group's Japanese songs.\nIn 2022, Seventeen released their first full English song, \"Darl+ing\", off their Face the Sun album. \"Even if we released – like beforehand – all Korean songs, they would try to interpret it and translate it in order to understand our lyrics. It was kind of like a thank you gift to our Carats,\" member Joshua said in a Grammy interview when discussing \"Darl+ing.\" In 2023, they worked with music producer Marshmello to release \"SOS\", another fully English song.\nSeventeen has also released songs in Chinese. During a concert in Macau, the group performed a new song titled \"相遇的意义\" (lit. 'The Meaning of Meeting'); they have also released Chinese versions of their Korean tracks.\n\n\n=== Choreography ===\nSeventeen's performances often feature intricate choreography. They frequently use their bigger group size to their advantage to create formations and tell a story through their dances.  Performance team leader Hoshi often co-choreographs pieces for the team, with contributions from the other three members of the unit. The group is also well known for their dance synchronization.\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Endorsements ===\nOn October 13, 2016, Seventeen were appointed models for the American perfume brand Clean.

    "text": "Superette were a New Zealand indie rock band, who were signed by Flying Nun Records.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 1993 in Auckland, New Zealand by members of the Jean-Paul Sartre Experience and Fang: Ben Howe, Dave Mulcahy, and Greta Anderson. The band's first release was the Rosepig EP, released in 1994. \"Killer Clown\" from the EP was released as a single in 1995. In 1996, the band's only album, Tiger was released, as well as a single taken from it, \"Touch Me\".\nThe band were often compared to Pixies, as well as Mulcahy's former band, the Jean-Paul Sartre Experience.\nAfter the band split up, Howe went on to start the record label Arch Hill Recordings. Mulcahy released a solo album, Oddy Knocky, in 1999, and went on to record two albums with the band Kimo, and later fronted several other bands. \nThe band reunited in 2003 for a live show, and again in 2006 for a performance to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Tiger's release.\nTiger was reissued in expanded form in 2018, included songs recorded as demos for a proposed second album.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nTiger (1996 - Flying Nun Records - FN352)\n\n\n=== EP ===\nRosepig (1994 - Flying Nun Records - FNCD326)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Killer Clown\" (1995 - 7\" - Flying Nun Records – FN326)\n\"Touch Me\" (1996 - CD Maxi-Single - Festival Records – D 1280)\n\"Touch Me\" / \"Anything\" (1996 - 7\" - Flying Nun Records – FN362)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nThe group have appeared on some compilations.\nThe following is a list of these albums that have featured tracks by the Superette.\n\n15 (1995 - Flying Nun Records - FNCD377)\nThe Sound Is Out There (1995 - Flying Nun Records – FNCD334, Festival Records - D 1168)\nAbbasalutely (1995 - Flying Nun Records - FN315)\nPop Eyed (1996 - Flying Nun Records - FNCD395)\nTopless Women Talk About Their Lives (1997 - Flying Nun Records - FNCD402)\nHow Much For Trade?

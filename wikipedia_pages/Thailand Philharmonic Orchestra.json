    "text": "The Thailand Philharmonic Orchestra (TPO) gave its inaugural performance at the Royal Thailand Navy Auditorium on 23 June 2005, in a gala concert for the International Trumpet Guild Conference. Over its first six seasons the TPO has consistently impressed and inspired audiences with its performances. Many conductors have led the TPO including Gudni Emilsson, Claude Villaret, Delta David Geir, Leo Phillips, Michalis Economou, Jeannine Wagnar, Dariusz Mikulski, Ligia Amadio, Christopher Hughes and Jeffery Meyer.\nSoloists from around the world regularly join the TPO for performances and have praised the orchestra for its growth and development in such a short period of time. Those guests have included Jens Lindemann, Lambis Vassiliadis, Boris Brovtsyn, Alexandros Economou, Tomas Strasil, Reinhold Friedrich, Cristina Bojin, Karina Di Virgilio, Mischa Maisky, Yoon Jin Kim, Jura Margulis, Christopher Espenschied, Dimitry Ashkenazy, Ara Malikian, Serouj Kradjian, Robyn Schulkowsky, Lucia Aliberti, and Otto Schilli among others.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first International appearance by TPO occurred in October 2009 when the Japanese Association of Orchestras extended the invitation to perform at the Asian Orchestras Festival in the Tokyo Opera City Concert Hall. In the same year the Royal Thai Government invited TPO to play at the gala concert for the 15th ASEAN Summit held in Cha-Am in front of 10 Prime Ministers from the 10 ASEAN countries and six from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\nOn September 29, 2010, TPO had the distinct honor to give a performance for HM King Bhumibol Adulyadej and HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn at Royal Medical College Auditorium, Siriraj Hospital. In the concert TPO paid tribute to His Majesty’s considerable musical talent. The concert served to honor the occasion of the 37th Anniversary of a special concert that His Majesty played for students at the Royal Medical College’s auditorium on September 29, 1973.\nTPO regularly performs for major national events for the Royal Thai Government, the most recent being to celebrate His Majesty the King’s 84th Birthday Celebration Concert on December 3 at Sanam Luang in downtown Bangkok.\nThe 2014–2015 season was Gudni Emilsson’s tenth season as Chief Conductor of the TPO. He continues the work of attracting a loyal and appreciative following in Thailand, while helping the TPO to build a reputation for performing excellence. Its annual schedule of more than 70 performances draws from over three centuries of orchestral repertoire as well as chamber, contemporary and specially-commissioned new music.\nEarly in 2015, the TPO collaborated with American conductor Jeffery Meyer in its international debut album, recording the complete orchestral works by renowned Thai composer, Narong Prangcharoen. The recording will be released by Albany recordings in mid-2015.\nThe TPO is proud to have the patronage of the Royal Thai Government and Mahidol University and enjoys a burgeoning multicultural tradition. The 95-member symphony orchestra is made up of musicians from more than 19 nations. The TPO has been active in recording many traditional Thai songs, and has produced 10 CDs of those works. In addition, the TPO has several new projects and collaborations on the horizon including recording sessions, concerts throughout Thailand, and several international performances.\n\n\n== Orchestra musicians ==\nA list of the principal players of the TPO as of 2015: \n\nSittichai Pengcharoen, concertmaster\nInga Causa, principal second violin\nColin Wrubleski, principal viola\nJuris Lakutis, principal cello\nMaris Arents, principal bass\nHiroshi Matsushima and Yu Jin Jung, co-principal flutes\nCooper Wright, principal oboe\nLe Dai and Worawut Khamchuanchuen, co-principal clarinets\nChristopher Schaub and Patrawut Punputhaphong, co-principal bassoons\nNantawat Waranich and Suparchai Sorathorn, co-principal horns\nSurasi Chanoksakul and Somjate Pookaew, co-principal trumpets\nPhilip Brink and Satit Chomchewchan, co-principal trombones\nKitti Sawetkittikul, principal tuba\nThayarat  Sopolpong, principal percussion\nKyle Acuncius, principal timpani\n\n\n== See also ==\nCollege of Music, Mahidol University\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nFacebook Fan Page of the TPO\nCollege of Music, Mahidol University - TPO host institution"

They also garnered some slots at music festivals including Mountain Jam, the Warren Haynes Christmas Jam, and Bonnaroo.\n2015 brought the band its first tours out of the south. They opened shows for Gregg Allman and Deep Purple, and participating in Joe Bonamassa's inaugural cruise. Also Elad Shapiro joined in early 2015 solidifying the lineup.

JD also participated in the 100th Birthday celebration for Les Paul in Paul's hometown of Waukesha in August.\nOn the success of their live show, growing fan base and a word of support from their friend Joe Bonamassa, the group ended up signing with Mascot Label Group in June 2015.

Taking a completely different approach than any of their previous work, they experimented and stretched to make a highly detailed loosely based concept piece. JD claimed that much of the lyrical content was autobiographical and was hard for him to listen to at times because of its revealing nature.

In the months following, JD continued to perform in a solo capacity with a revolving cast of friends rounding out the lineup. Only Adam Abrashoff remained as the drummer.

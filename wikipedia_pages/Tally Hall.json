    "text": "Tally Hall (sometimes stylized as tallyhall) is an American rock band formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in December 2002, and publicly active until the conclusion of their Good & Evil tour in 2011. The band is known for its upbeat melodies, whimsical lyrics, and a dedicated fanbase on social media sites. The members originally described their musical style as \"wonky rock\", later redefining their sound as \"fabloo\" ( fə-BLOO), to not let any particular genres define their music after critics began defining the characteristics of \"wonky rock\".\nTally Hall has five members, each of them distinguished by the color of their neckties: guitarist Rob Cantor (yellow), guitarist Joe Hawley (red), drummer Ross Federman (gray), keyboardist Andrew Horowitz (green), and bassist Zubin Sedghi (blue). Touring partner Casey Shea, producer and roadie Bora Karaca, and host of local radio show Tree Town Sound Matthew Altruda also had dedicated colors for their neckties (black, orange, and pink, respectively). All five members have provided vocals for the band.\nOnce under the Atlantic Records recording label, Tally Hall was, again, signed to the indie label Quack! Media, who previously helped finance and nationally distribute their debut studio album, Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum on October 24, 2005. They released their second album, Good & Evil, on June 24, 2011.\nSome Tally Hall members (Rob Cantor,  Joe Hawley, and Zubin Sedghi) also provided the vocals and music for all of the songs in Happy Monster Band, a children's television series that aired on Playhouse Disney.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years and Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum ===\nAndrew, born in Warren, New Jersey, began writing songs when he was eight years old and studied composition at the University of Michigan. There he met Rob Cantor, who had both attended high school with Zubin Sedghi and joined Joe Hawley's film production group, AnonyMous. Tally Hall's original drummer, Steve Gallagher, left the band in May 2004. Ross Federman, whom Hawley knew from high school, took his place shortly thereafter.\n\nOn October 24, 2005, the band released their debut studio album, Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum, with violinist Jeremy Kittel contributing strings. They re-released the album on September 12, 2006, on the local label Quack! Media. Tally Hall went on to receive national media attention, performing their song \"Good Day\" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on August 2, 2006, as well as appearing in MTV's segment \"You Hear It First\" in September 2006. The band appeared at the 2007 South by Southwest Music Festival. They signed to Atlantic Records in March 2007 and re-recorded their first album, releasing it on April 1, 2008. In August 2008, Tally Hall was a performer on the BMI stage at Lollapalooza.\nTally Hall was invited back by The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on September 16, 2008, to help promote the launch of Tally Hall's Internet Show. They performed \"Welcome to Tally Hall\" in newly donned black vests on top of their traditional colored ties, white shirts, and black pants. The band worked on several projects after the completion of Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum, including covering the song \"Smile Like You Mean It\" by The Killers for the sixth The O.C. soundtrack: Music from the OC: Mix 6.\n\n\n=== Tours and Good & Evil ===\n\nOn September 9, 2009, Tally Hall released the song \"Light & Night\", featuring Nellie McKay, as a free download when customers of Walmart purchased The Magician's Elephant by Kate DiCamillo, published the same day.\nIn the band's 2010 March tour with Jukebox the Ghost and Skybox, Joe Hawley backed out of the tour and was subsequently replaced with Casey Shea, who wore a black tie, and filled in for him for the rest of their live shows that year. On March 25, 2011, the band announced that all five original band members were still together. Later in the year, the band changed their management from The Hornblow Group, who also manages They Might Be Giants, OK Go, and Oppenheimer, to Stiletto Entertainment, who manages solo performance acts such as Barry Manilow.\nTheir second album, Good & Evil, was released in 2011 under their original label, Quack! Media. The album had been recorded in late 2009, but due to repeated delays caused by their deal with Atlantic Records falling apart, it was released two years after it had originally been recorded. To promote the album, the band held a contest where the winner would be awarded a song written about them. The winner was a high school student named Nathan Naimark, whose self-titled theme song would be released soon after. Around the same time, the band released a cover of the Flo Rida song \"Club Can't Handle Me\", with Casey Shea on guest vocals. According to Horowitz, the origin of the cover came from a suggestion the band had made to Atlantic records, where they would record and release covers of other artists signed to the label weekly, with the song presented as an example. The label rejected the idea, leading the band to release the song after they had parted ways with them. \nAfter the release of Good & Evil and its tour, Tally Hall became inactive with all band members going on to independent endeavors, though some of the projects had multiple members collaborate once again.\n\n\n=== Solo work after Good & Evil ===\nAndrew Horowitz, under the moniker \"edu\", released the solo album sketches (later re-released as sketches 3d) in 2012. He additionally provided production and piano on John Legend's Love in the Future. In 2018, Horowitz released etudes, a studio album of piano compositions written in 2003. A sequel titled etudes II was released in April 2019, featuring compositions written in 2005 while he attended the University of Michigan. In May 2020, he started a weekly Instagram livestream series titled Keep Up The Good Work, featuring interchanging guests such as Federman and Sedghi. On April 29th, 2024, Andrew Horowitz was announced to be performing at the Michigan concert series Sonic Lunch.\nRoss Federman has made occasional appearances as a producer, percussionist, and DJ under the pseudonym \"Mr. F\", although has primarily focused on his education. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 2013 with a Bachelor of Science in Cell and Molecular Biology, later receiving a Ph.D. in Immunology from Yale University in May 2019.\nIn 2012, Joe Hawley released a single titled \"Variations on a Cloud\" on September 11th, 2012 under the name ミラクルミュージカル (Miracle Musical), later releasing the concept album Hawaii: Part II on December 12, 2012. Tally Hall members Federman and Karaca additionally worked on the album, with Sedghi and Cantor appearing on the album's tracks \"White Ball\" and \"Time Machine\", respectively. Hawley has been vague regarding the overarching story behind the album, at one point citing the September 11 attacks as inspiration, however this has been contradicted in other interviews. Several songs from the album, such as \"Murders\" and \"The Mind Electric\", have since achieved popularity on TikTok and other social media. An album featuring demos and samples titled Hawaii: Part II: Part ii and a cover of \"Candle on the Water\" was released in 2014 under the same name. An album of 6 8-bit renditions titled Hawaii Partii released in 2015 as the soundtrack for the promotional game Labyrinth.\nIn mid-2016, Hawley announced the comedy hip-hop album Joe Hawley Joe Hawley, which was released in October under his name on Bandcamp. The album was later taken down due to sampled copyrighted music. To avoid copyright, Hawley released γɘlwɒH ɘoႱ γɘlwɒH ɘoႱ on April 16, 2019, a reversed version of the album, to Bandcamp and Spotify. On November 11, 2020, a truncated version of the original album was uploaded to Apple Music and Spotify, removing the 13th and final track (a cover of rock band Jefferson Airplane's \"White Rabbit\"). The latter was due to copyright issues he could not resolve.\nZubin Sedghi, aside from appearing in Hawaii: Part II, shifted his focus towards his personal life. In 2012, he graduated from the University of Michigan with an undergraduate honors degree in Neuroscience, later receiving a doctorate in osteopathic medicine at Touro University California in 2016. He now works as a family medicine doctor for Kaiser Permanente in Orange County, California. Sedghi is married with two kids.\nRob Cantor released his solo album, Not a Trampoline, on April 14, 2014. In addition, he has made several viral videos on YouTube, including \"Shia LaBeouf\", \"Christian Bale Is At Your Party\", and \"29 Celebrity Impressions, 1 Original Song\". In recent years, Cantor has written and produced songs for several Disney Junior shows.\nIn 2015, Tally Hall released the demo LP Admittedly Incomplete Demos on Bandcamp, referencing their earlier collection Complete Demos. It includes demos, unreleased songs, live performances, and studio covers of \"The Minstrel Boy\" and \"Just A Friend\". The latter was re-released in August 2019 as a single and included as a bonus track on the 2021 re-issue of Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum. In April 2022, 2 new demos were added: \"Welcome to Tally Hall (Reprise) (Demo)\" and \"Hymn For a Scarecrow (Demo)\".\nIn 2021, Needlejuice Records re-issued Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum on vinyl, CD, and cassette, releasing a MiniDisc in June to coincide with International MiniDisc Day. On August 26, 2022, pre-orders for a re-issue of Good & Evil went public alongside a 7\" vinyl for \"Turn the Lights Off\" with the aforementioned track on the A side and \"Light & Night\" on the B side.\nSince the band's hiatus, members have discussed if the band would return for a third album. While Hawley has promised it on social media and Sedghi has jokingly stated that they would return if they received \"thirty or forty million listeners a month\" via a message for Spotify Wrapped, the latter, Horowitz, Federman, and Cantor have stated otherwise on Horowitz' Twitter account, citing Hawley's mental health as a primary reason for the band not returning.\nIn December of 2023, Andrew Horowitz, accompanied by Bora Karaca on guitar, opened for performances of Jukebox the Ghost, as well as in April 2024, this time with Ross Federman on drums.\n\n\n== Videos ==\nWhile the band formed, Joe Hawley worked with the comedy sketch group AnonyMous. The group made several movies of humorous skits and music videos, the latter containing Tally Hall songs such as \"Banana Man\", which resulted in significant publicity on the website Albino Blacksheep.\nIn August 2008, the band performed a three-song live video set for LiveDaily Sessions, including the songs \"Good Day\", \"Be Born\", and \"Greener\", which premiered on August 28, 2008. They have appeared on Fearless Music several times, playing songs such as \"Be Born\", \"Ruler of Everything\", \"Misery Fell\", \"Good Day\", and \"Banana Man\".\nIn July 2014, band member Rob Cantor released a video in which he appeared to perform his song \"Perfect\" by singing spot-on impressions of 29 celebrities. In the video, Cantor is accompanied by Andrew Horowitz on piano and backing vocals. The video received more than 7,000,000 views in 10 days. Shortly thereafter, Cantor revealed the video to be an elaborate hoax.\n\n\n=== Tally Hall's Internet Show and music videos ===\nOn September 15, 2008, the band debuted the ten-part bi-weekly variety-show series Tally Hall's Internet Show (T.H.I.S.). Each episode ran 8–11 minutes long and was posted on their website. The content primarily included comedy sketches and music videos. The first episode was titled after and featured a video for their single \"Good Day\", which was later released onto YouTube. Other music videos created for the show include \"Dream\", \"Welcome to Tally Hall\", \"Two Wuv\", \"The Whole World and You\", \"Greener\", \"Ruler of Everything\", and \"Hidden in the Sand\" were featured in the show. Videos for \"Taken for a Ride\" and \"Turn the Lights Off\" were additionally released outside of the show, with a music video for \"&\" being planned but abandoned before its release.\n\n\n==== Episode list ====\nGood Day (September 15, 2008) – 9:24\nDeath Request (September 29, 2008) – 11:36\nTaken for a Ride (October 13, 2008) – 9:17\nWelcome to Tally Hall (October 27, 2008) – 11:37\nWho Cares (November 10, 2008) – 9:25\nTwo Wuv (November 24, 2008) – 10:32\nFifteen Seconds of Bora (December 8, 2008) – 9:08\nThe Whole World and You (December 22, 2008) – 11:06\nPotato Vs.

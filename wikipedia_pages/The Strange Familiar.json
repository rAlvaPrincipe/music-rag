    "text": "The Strange Familiar is an American pop rock band from Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. The group was originally formed in 2006 by the husband and wife singer-songwriter team Jeff Andrea and Kira Leyden, former members of the popular Akron, OH band Jaded Era. Their first single, \"Courage Is...\", gained them significant attention after it was heavily promoted on ABC Family to launch a brand new series. In 2012, the band was featured on mtvU, Season 3 of the hit series The Vampire Diaries and Pretty Little Liars. Other members include fellow Ohio natives Frank Freeman (bass) and Nicholas Sainato (drums).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nKira Leyden and Jeff Andrea first met in grammar school in Cuyahoga Falls, OH. \"I was in seventh grade when I saw Jeff's band playing Pearl Jam's ‘Yellow Ledbetter’ at our school dance,\" Leyden recalls. \"The singer forgot the words and walked off the stage, and I remember thinking, ‘I could do better than that!’\". A life long partnership sprang from that serendipitous beginning, forged by their mutual love of music. Their first gig together was a grade-school dance. By the time they were in high school, their band had morphed into Jaded Era, one of the top indie groups in the Akron, Ohio area. From its classroom origins, the piano pop and guitar-styled group has graduated to national exposure.\n\n\n=== 2006: Formation of The Strange Familiar ===\nAfter Jaded Era disbanded, Kira and Jeff headed to the Leyden family basement, where they set up a studio and started writing songs that would become the foundation of The Strange Familiar. After months of performing around town and experimenting with new sounds, they recruited bass player, Frank Freeman, who had also parted ways with his band. The three of them made a bold move to Los Angeles where a combination of good fortune and hard work began opening doors for them. One of the good happenings was a meeting with producer/record label exec Brian Malouf who has worked with Everclear, Pearl Jam, and Michael Jackson. Brian went on to produce and mix their debut EP, helping the group to home in on their sound.\n\n\n=== 2008: \"You Can't Go Back\" EP ===\nThe Strange Familiar independently released their first EP in 2008.\n\n\n=== 2009: \"This Is Gravity\" ===\nThe Strange Familiar lift their resonant pop rock to new heights on their debut full length album, \"This Is Gravity\". The album was released independently on the band's own label, Paper Doll Records. It features seven new tracks and five songs from their self-released 2008 EP, \"You Can’t Go Back\", including singles \"Secret Life (You & Me)\" and \"Courage Is...\"\n\n\n=== 2012: \"Chasing Shadows\" ===\nThe band signed a record deal with indie label, Krian Music Group, and released their first nationally distributed full-length album, \"Chasing Shadows\", on April 10, 2012.\n\n\n== Appearances and performances ==\n\n\n=== ABC Family ===\nThe band first gained national attention when their song \"Courage Is...\", from their self-released debut You Can't Go Back EP, was used in trailers and promotions for the new hit ABC Family series The Secret Life of the American Teenager in 2008. \"Lyrically and tonally, the song couldn't have been more perfect for the show,\" says Stacy Asturias, creative director at ABC Family. \"Plus, it's just a really beautiful song in its own right. We love to hear great new music, and so does our fan base.\" Without a label, their debut EP quickly reached the Top 10 on iTunes. ABC Family continued to feature The Strange Familiar and their songs \"I Just Want To Love You\" and \"Secret Life (You and Me)\" in promos for Season Two and Season Three of Secret Life. A music video for \"Secret Life (You and Me)\" was included as a bonus feature on season 2 DVD. The band also wrote and recorded an original Christmas single \"The Only Gift I Need\" for Walt Disney's compilation album Songs to Celebrate 25 Days of Christmas.\nSince the 2012 release of their album Chasing Shadows, ABC Family has used their song \"Redemption\" in promos and trailers for Switched at Birth and their single \"Unwanted\" was featured in a season 3 episode of Pretty Little Liars.\n\n\n=== America's Got Talent ===\nThe Strange Familiar appeared on the fifth season of America's Got Talent and reached the Top 48.

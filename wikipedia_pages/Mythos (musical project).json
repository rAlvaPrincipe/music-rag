    "text": "Mythos is a Canadian new age musical project started by Bob D'Eith and Paul Schmidt in 1996. Bob (piano) and Paul (guitar) collectively wrote, produced, and performed on the albums with the help of various session performers. The centerpiece of the Mythos sound rests on the acoustic guitar and piano, which are accented by guest vocalists. Synthesizers and performances in various other musical styles are regularly incorporated into the music.\n\n\n== History ==\nRobert (Bob) D'Eith attended the University of Victoria in the 1980s, receiving both a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and a Bachelor of Law (LLB) from this institution. Before creating Mythos, he played keyboards in Rock band Rymes with Orange, and contributed to the scores of a number of film and television productions. Throughout his musical career, he also maintained a private legal practice in Entertainment Law, and currently holds the titles of President for Adagio Music (Mythos' label, formerly \"Spark\"), and Executive Director of Music BC.\nD'Eith and Schmidt formed Mythos in 1995. Mythos' initial releases, Introspection and Iridescence, were on D'Eith's Spark Records and were confined to the Canadian market. The success of these albums led to Mythos' distribution by the Higher Octave label, who first released an eponymous album containing mostly songs from prior releases. This release was commercially successful, peaking at 18 on the Billboard Top New Age Albums chart. Higher Octave went on to release two more studio albums by the group, both of which placed on the Billboard chart. Higher Octave has been restructured multiple times in the past few years by its parent labels, Narada and EMI. The most recent Mythos album, Purity, is being distributed by Pacific Music and Alula Records. In 2010, Mythos released Rain, a remixed version of Wind (from Introspection), in celebration of the group's 15 year anniversary.\nIn 2013, Mythos released \"Journey\" on Adagio Music/The Orchard, followed in 2015 with a special 20th Anniversary Vinyl Best of Mythos collection. August 3, 2018 Mythos released the EP \"Eros\" on Adagio Music/The Orchard. In 2021, Mythos released a 25th Anniversary Album \"XXV\" featuring 5 new tracks and 9 fully remastered classics.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nCritics have described Mythos as New Age, Ambient, Ethereal, and Film-Oriented, with influences from Jazz, Classical, Gospel-Soul, and various World styles. Many of their songs include vocalize performances, but few have lyrics. The music is multi-layered, incorporating synthesizers and a numerous acoustic instruments. Multiple guest artists and/or session musicians have contributed to each of Mythos' studio releases, most prominently husband and wife pair Rene Worst (bass) and Jennifer Scott (vocals).\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nMythos was nominated for Juno Instrumental Artist of the Year award in 1998.\nBob D'Eith was nominated for the Canadian Music Awards' Best Keyboardist of the Year in 1995.\nIndividual albums have won and been nominated for various awards, as described in the Discography.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Introspection ===\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\n\"Wind\" - 4:00\n\"November\" - 4:58\n\"Angels Weep\" - 8:33\n\"Paradox\" - 4:42\n\"Premonition\" - 4:09\n\"Cathedral\" - 4:32\n\"The Nile\" - 4:01\n\"Clockwork\" - 4:45\n\"Sirens\" - 3:29\n\"Prelude\" - 2:36\n\"Introspection\" - 4:01\n\"November [Remix]\" - 5:32\n\n\n==== Awards ====\nWinner West Coast Music Award Best Dance Album\n\n\n==== Performance Credits ====\nBob D'Eith: Piano, Keyboards\nPaul Schmidt: Guitar\nChristine Duncan: Vocals\nJennifer Scott: Vocals\nRene Worst: Bass\n\n\n=== Angels Weep ===\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\n\"Angels Weep (Radio Edit)\" - 3:42\n\"Angels Dance (Remix)\" - 3:33\n\"November (Radio Edit)\" - 3:15\n\"November Dance (Remix Edit)\" - 3:26\n\"The Nile (Bonus Track)\" - 4:00\n\n\n=== Iridescence ===\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\n\"Loneliness\" - 3:38\n\"Sunless Sea\" - 4:01\n\"Iridescence\" - 4:15\n\"Planinata\" - 3:28\n\"Brazil\" - 4:15\n\"La Cathedral\" - 1:59\n\"Sacred River\" - 3:05\n\"Evolution\" - 5:08\n\"June\" - 5:07\n\"Motif\" - 2:47\n\"Danse Plantania\" - 3:31\n\"Sacred River [Remix]\" - 3:01\n\"Angels Dance\" - 3:32\n\n\n==== Performance Credits ====\nBob D'Eith: Piano, Keyboards\nPaul Schmidt: Guitar\nAnnette Ducharme: Vocals\nChristine Duncan: Vocals\nNiko Quintal: Percussion\nJennifer Scott: Vocals\nRene Worst: Bass\n\n\n=== Mythos ===\n\n\n==== Background ====\nThis is Mythos' debut on the Higher Octave label, consisting mostly of previously released material.

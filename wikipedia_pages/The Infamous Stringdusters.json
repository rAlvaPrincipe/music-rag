    "text": "The Infamous Stringdusters are a progressive acoustic/bluegrass band. The band first emerged in 2006 with the limited release of a five-song extended play CD The Infamous Stringdusters, followed in 2007 by their first album Fork in the Road. Both of these were on Sugar Hill Records. The band consists of Andy Hall (Dobro), Andy Falco (guitar), Chris Pandolfi (banjo), Jeremy Garrett (fiddle), and Travis Book (double bass). The band has become known for a complex, distinctive, and groove-friendly sound along with a bluegrass theme.\nThe Infamous Stringdusters won three awards at the International Bluegrass Music Association Awards Ceremony in October 2007: Emerging Artist of the Year, Album of the Year for Fork in the Road (in a tie with J.D. Crowe & the New South's album Lefty's Old Guitar), and Song of the Year for the album's title cut. The band was also nominated for 2011 Entertainer of the Year by the International Bluegrass Music Association.\nIn 2011, \"Magic No. 9\" (from Things That Fly) was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance. In 2018, they won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album. In 2021, the band was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Bluegrass Album category for their album \"A Tribute to Bill Monroe.\"\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe creation of the Infamous Stringdusters is first based on the relationships that banjo player Chris Pandolfi, dobro player Andy Hall, and former guitarist Chris Eldridge formed while in Boston, Massachusetts. Hall, Pandolfi and Eldridge were students at Berklee College of Music.  Pandolfi and Eldridge soon followed Andy Hall to Nashville, Tennessee, where they met Hall's Ronnie Bowman Committee bandmates Jesse Cobb (mandolin) and Jeremy Garrett (fiddle). The group then held an audition for a possible bassist in the fall of 2005, where they found Travis Book. Book had been residing in Durango, Colorado. Eldridge soon departed in 2007 to join Chris Thile's Punch Brothers and was replaced by guitarist Andy Falco. In October 2011, Jesse Cobb announced his departure from the group. Cobb cited mental and physical stress as the reason for his leaving days before the release of We'll Do It Live.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n2007: Fork in the Road (Sugar Hill)\n2008: The Infamous Stringdusters (Sugar Hill)\n2010: Things That Fly (Sugar Hill)\n2011: We'll Do It Live (High Country)\n2012: Silver Sky (High Country)\n2014: Let It Go (High Country)\n2016: Ladies & Gentlemen (Compass)\n2017: Laws of Gravity (Compass)\n2019: Rise Sun (Tape Time)\n2020: Dust The Halls (Americana Vibes)\n2021: A Tribute to Bill Monroe (Americana Vibes)\n2022: Toward the Fray (Americana Vibes)\n2023: A Tribute to Flatt & Scruggs\n2024: Songs from the River\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n2006: The Infamous Stringdusters (Sugar Hill)\n2013: Road to Boulder (High Country)\n2015: Undercover (Lumenhouse)\n2017: Undercover Vol. 2 (Lumenhouse)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2014: \"I'll Get Away\" (High Country Recordings)\n2016: \"I Believe\" feat.

Deaf Sty's vocals are reminiscent of James Blake and Jeff Buckley, but have a rawer rasp like that of Hamilton Leithauser from The Walkmen.\nThe percussion of Gora Sou uses live Latin rhythms on top of synthesised beats, not dissimilar to those found on Friendly Fires records.\nThe synth melodies and guitar hooks, often use a hypnotic rhythm typical of Berlin Techno or Deep House.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site\nMySpace\nYouTube Channel\nFacebook page"

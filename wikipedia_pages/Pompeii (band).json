Formed in Austin, Texas in 2004, the band is best known for their melodic and ambient rock sound, which features the addition of classical strings.  Pompeii's style is noted as having a saturated ambient, elegant sound. Pompeii have received international attention and critical acclaim from outlets such as The New York Times, The Guardian, The Chicago Tribune, American Songwriter, Stereogum, NPR, Apple, Under the Radar, and MTV, as well as their song \"Where We're Going, We Don't Need Roads\" being played during the ending scene of The Giant Mechanical Man.\n\n\n== History ==\nDean Stafford and Rob Davidson grew up playing music together in Corpus Christi, Texas.  In 2002, they moved to Austin, Texas to attend St. Edward's University where they formed Pompeii with bassist Shane Stevens, before adding cellist Caitlin Bailey.  While looking for a keyboard player, the band met guitarist Erik Johnson, who came up with the name Pompeii.  In 2007, Stevens left the band to focus on starting a family.

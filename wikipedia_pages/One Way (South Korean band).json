They made their debut on March 6, 2010 on MBC's Music Core with their promotional single, \"Magic\". Since their debut, they have appeared in many radio shows, such as MBC Starry Night, TBS K-popular hosted by As One, TBS Music Planet hosted by J.ae, and Arirang Evening Groove hosted by DJ Dorothy.\nOne Way is considered to be an up-and-coming R&B group that is garnering attention both in South Korea and internationally for composing their own music and their unique \"one way sound\". They have posted various covers on their official YouTube channel, such as Ne-Yo's \"Sexy Love\", and made their official debut on YouTube with their self-written track \"U-Drag\", which is also featured on their first episode called One Way Street.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeter and Sky first met in high school in Sydney, Australia. Later on, Sky moved to Los Angeles, California, where he met Chance in high school. All three members are fluent in English and Korean.\nOne Way's debut in the United States took place at Stony Brook University's Korean Night on April 7, 2011, followed by Rutgers University's ProjectKorea - IV on April 8, 2011.\nIn 2011, it was announced that Chance would be putting the group on hiatus.\nThe two members, Sky and Peter, later decided to make a sub-unit called \"Detour\". Former member Chance became a member of the music composing and production team Duble Sidekick as the leader and main composer. He was later successful and was able to collaborate with artists such as 2PM, B.A.P's Yongguk, MBLAQ, Haha&Skull, Baek Jiyoung, Huh Gak, Zia, B1A4, Dalmatian and The Seeya; his team also won the \"Song Writer Award\" in the MelOn Music Awards.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nPeter\nSky\n\n\n=== Former ===\nChance\n\n\n== Discography ==\nOne Way Remix (May 19, 2010)\nCD Track list:\n\n\"U-drag\"\n\"One-way\"\n\"Magic\"\n\"없는 번호\" (Obneun Beonho)\n\"CASINO\"\nOne Way Street (March 4, 2010)\nCD Track list:\n\n\"U-drag\"\n\"One-way\"\n\"Magic\"\n\"없는 번호\" (Obneun Beonho)\n\"CASINO\"\n\"Magic\" (R&B Remix)\n\"Magic\" (instrumental)\n\"없는 번호\" (Obneun Beonho) (instrumental)\nOne Way Street Philippine Edition (August 6, 2010)\nCD Track list:\n\n\"U-drag\"\n\"One-way\"\n\"Magic\"\n\"없는 번호\" (Obneun Beonho)\n\"CASINO\"\n\"Magic\" (R&B remix)\n\"Magic\" (instrumental)\n\"없는 번호\" (Obneun Beonho) (instrumental)\nBonus tracks and bonus DVD\nPhilippines only bonus tracks:\n\nBonus DVD – music videos of:\n\n\"Magic\"\n\"Wrong Number\"\n\"U Drag\"\n\"One Way\"\n\"Rainy Days\" (digital single) (August 6, 2010)\n\"Rainy Days\" (Feat.

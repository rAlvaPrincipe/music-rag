    "text": "Dirty Loops is a band from Stockholm, Sweden, made up of Jonah Nilsson (keyboards and lead vocals), Henrik Linder (bass and backing vocals) and Aron Mellergård (drums and backing vocals). Their arrangements borrow from jazz and jazz fusion, gospel, funk, electronica, pop, and disco. They are known for their jazz fusion reharmonized covers of pop songs like \"Baby\" by Justin Bieber, \"Rolling in the Deep\" by Adele, ''Just Dance'' by Lady Gaga, and \"Wake Me Up\" by Avicii. They also performed the 2016 rendition of the song \"Over the Horizon\" for the new Samsung Galaxy S7/S7Edge by Samsung Electronics.\n\n\n== Background ==\nJonah and Henrik were childhood friends and met Aron when all three of the band's members studied music at Södra Latin together. \nAfter upper secondary school, they attended the Royal College of Music in Stockholm together.

In February 2011, they signed a management contract with producer and songwriter Andreas Carlsson. On September 3, 2011, the band backed Danny Saucedo at the Aftonbladet music gala, \"Rockbjörnen\".\nManager Andreas Carlsson has prioritised developing the band's brand. Above all, he has advised them to be careful about what they upload and publish on the Internet. They have appeared in several television interviews, and in 2015 they appeared as middle act in the Swedish Melodifestivalen where they performed the 2014 winning song \"Undo\" performed by artist Sanna Nielsen.\nAndreas Carlsson has helped the band to get a global record deal. In 2012, the band traveled to the U.S. to face several major music profiles, among others, singer Brian McKnight, drummer Simon Phillips and bassist Nathan East. Eventually, they signed a record contract with world-renowned producer and record label director David Foster and Universal Music subsidiary Verve.\n\n\n=== Debut album: Loopified ===\nTheir debut album, Loopified was released on 16 April 2014, in Japan, on May 19 in the UK, and on 19 August in the US.\n\n\n=== Hiatus and Phoenix ===\nCiting creative differences during the early production of their second album, the group have announced that they would go on hiatus and pursue individual interests.

He also started learning the double bass at age eight, but quickly made a switch to piano lessons in classical music at age 11, inspired by one of his favorite Chopin pieces, Fantasie Impromptu in C sharp minor. In his final year at high school, he switched over to jazz piano studies. He attended various music schools including Sodra Latin, Adolf Fredrik School of Music, Betel College and the Royal Music Academy in Stockholm.\nAt age 17, he collaborated with Arvid Svenungsson to produce a biblical-based musical centered on the character Job. He met Aron Mellergård and wrote songs together in the vein of groovy funk, inspired by music of the 80's and bands like Toto. Later, he joined Danny Saucedo's tour as backing vocals and keyboardist. His songwriting and music production skills caused him to be well sought after by many, including Jenny Berggren, a former member of the band Ace of Base.\n\n\n=== Henrik Linder – bass guitar ===\nHenrik Linder was born in Sweden and started playing piano at age 4. Growing up, he listened to music that his older sister listened to, including artists such as Soundgarden since he liked the band's use of odd meters in their songs. When he was around 12 years old, a girl he had a crush on told him that bass was the \"sexiest instrument\".\nLater on, at 13 years old, Linder switched to bass guitar. One of his first childhood bass idols was Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers after listening to the band's song \"Aeroplane\" from the album One Hot Minute. In addition, Linder later discovered groups like The Brecker Brothers and Tribal Tech, featuring Gary Willis on bass. Gary Willis would become one of his greatest influences. Linder also started taking lessons with a local Swedish bass player, Robert Sudin. At age 16, Linder was already a busy Stockholm session musician and played with many different groups.\nLinder attended secondary school at Södra Latin, and afterwards, studied jazz at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm, Sweden. While studying, he collaborated with his childhood friend and drummer Aron Mellergårdh. As classmates at the Royal Academy of Music, they would both practice and jam together as much as possible. Later on, Mellergårdh and Linder started working with another one of their classmates and childhood friends, pianist and vocalist Jonah Nilsson. Their collaboration eventually led to the creation of Dirty Loops in 2008.\n\n\n=== Aron Mellergård – drums ===\nAron Mellergård grew up in Gislaved Sweden where he was inspired to learn to play the drums from a musical family. He met future Dirty Loops bandmates Jonah Nilsson and Henrik Linder at Södra Latin, a secondary school in Södermalm Stockholm. He then attended the Royal College of Music in Stockholm before committing to Dirty Loops.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nDirty Loops at AllMusic\nDirty Loops discography at MusicBrainz\nDirty Loops discography at Discogs"

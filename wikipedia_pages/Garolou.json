    "text": "Garolou is a Canadian progressive and folk-rock group. Formed in 1975 by French Canadians from Ontario and Quebec, the band was originally called Lougarou, but had to change its name after being sued by a dance troupe named Les Loups-garous. The group became popular not only in Quebec but across Canada, with its rock sound and its lyrics taken from French and French Canadian traditional songs.\nIn 1993 the band made a return supported by many concerts each year. The band performed at many music festivals such as the Festival International d'été de Québec and the Festival franco-ontarien. The band released in 1997 a live album called Réunion that captured Garolou's live experience and, two years later, a brand new album called Mémoire Vive.\nGarolou has won two Félix Awards (ADISQ Gala) for the albums Garolou (1978) and Romancero (1980) and a Gold certification for the album Garolou (1978).\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nMarc Lalonde : Bass and vocals\nMichel Lalonde : Guitar and vocals\nMichel (Stan) Deguire : Drums and percussions\nGaston Gagnon : Electric guitar and vocals\nRéginald Guay : Keyboards and vocals\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nGilles Beaudoin : Electric guitar and vocals (Garolou album)\nGeorges Antoniak : Electric guitar and vocals (Lougarou album)\nSteven Naylor[1] : Keyboards and vocals (Lougarou album)\n\n\n=== Additional musicians (albums) ===\nBobby Lalonde : Violin (Garolou, Romancero and Réunion albums)\nReynald Wiseman : Saxophone (Romancero and Centre-Ville albums)\n\n\n=== Additional musicians (concerts) ===\nBobby Lalonde : Violin\nBruno Dumont : Saxophone\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1999 Mémoire Vive (album)\n1997 Réunion (live album)\n1982 Centre-Ville (album)\n1980 Romancero (album)\n1978 Garolou (album)\n1976 Lougarou (album)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n1991 Tableaux d'hier V.2\n1991 Tableaux d'hier V.1\n1981 Profil (album)\n\n\n=== Other compilations ===\n2000 Québec Rock, vol. 2 (CD)\n1998 La nuit sur l'étang 1973-1998 (CD)\n1981 Les Félix / Gagnants 1980 (CD)\n\n\n== Popular songs ==\n\"Ah toi belle hirondelle\"\n\"Germaine\"\n\"La belle Françoise\"\n\"À la claire fontaine\"\n\"Victoria\"\n\"La partance\"\n\"La complainte du Maréchal Biron\"\n\"Aux Illinois\"\n\"La Vendée\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nGarolou Wikipedia page (French)\nMusic of Quebec\n\n\n== External links ==\nGarolou @ ProgQuébec.com\nGaston Gagnon official website Archived 2009-03-18 at the Wayback Machine"

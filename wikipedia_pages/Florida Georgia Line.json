    "text": "Florida Georgia Line was an American country music duo founded in 2010 by vocalists and songwriters Tyler Hubbard of Georgia and Brian Kelley of Florida. Their 2012 debut single \"Cruise\" broke two major sales records: it was downloaded over seven million times, making it the first country song ever to receive the Diamond certification, and it became the best-selling digital country song, with 24 weeks at number one, until it was surpassed in July 2017 by Sam Hunt's \"Body Like a Back Road\". Their music style is described as \"bro-country\", which incorporates production elements from rock and hip hop music, and tends to cover subject matter such as partying, drinking, driving trucks and sexual attraction.\nFlorida Georgia Line was formed in 2010 in Nashville, Tennessee as a cover band. In December 2011, they signed to the Big Loud label and in 2012, they released their second EP, It'z Just What We Do, which charted on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. They then signed with Republic Nashville, part of Big Machine Records and released Anything Goes (2014), Dig Your Roots (2016), Can't Say I Ain't Country (2019), and Life Rolls On (2021). The duo went on hiatus in 2022, ultimately resulting in a breakup, at which point both members began solo careers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nMusicians Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard met in 2008 at Belmont University through a campus worship group, and following graduation, decided to give themselves two years to succeed as a country duo. They moved in together and began several odd jobs to pay bills, while playing clubs on the weekends. While independent, they recorded and digitally distributed their first EP, Anything Like Me (2010). They were discovered by Nickelback producer Joey Moi at a county fair, and the three began recording in studio together. Unlike typical country music sessions, the group spent days polishing songs, which were collected on the duo's second EP, It'z Just What We Do (2012). The band modeled their sound on bands such as Nickelback, Shinedown, and Three Days Grace, while Moi aimed for each song to resemble hair metal group Def Leppard in structure. Major labels became interested when the song \"Cruise\" first aired on The Highway channel on Sirius XM and began selling well in the iTunes Store, leading to a deal with Republic Nashville and Big Machine Records.\n\n\n=== 2010: Anything Like Me ===\nFlorida Georgia Line's first EP, released on December 14, 2010, is a six-song EP produced with Wesley Walker. All of the songs were written by either Hubbard or Hubbard and Kelley. The EP consists of the songs \"You're Country\", \"Now That She's Gone\", \"Man I Am Today\", \"Never Let Her Go\" (co-written with \"Cruise\" co-writer Chase Rice), \"Black Tears\", and \"Backwoods Beauty Queen\". The song \"Black Tears\" was also on Jason Aldean's 2012 album Night Train.\n\n\n=== 2012–2013: It'z Just What We Do and Here's to the Good Times ===\nThe duo's second EP is a five-song EP produced by Joey Moi on Big Loud and released on May 15, 2012. It starts off with \"Cruise\" and also includes \"Get Your Shine On\", \"Tip It Back\", \"Tell Me How You Like It\", and the title track \"It'z Just What We Do\".\nThe duo's first studio album, Here's to the Good Times, was an 11-song album produced by Joey Moi on Republic Nashville and released on December 4, 2012. The pair's first full-length, Here's to the Good Times, was the sixth-best-selling album of 2013 (topping Drake and Katy Perry, among others). \"Cruise\", the first single, reached number one on the Country Airplay chart dated December 15, 2012. A remix of \"Cruise\" featuring Nelly later hit number four on the US Billboard Hot 100. In January 2014, \"Cruise\" became the best-selling country digital song of all time. The song spent a record 24 weeks at number one on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, which was the longest reign in the history of the chart until July 2017 when it was surpassed by Sam Hunt's \"Body Like a Back Road\".\nThe album's second single, \"Get Your Shine On\", was released to country radio on January 21, 2013, and reached number one on the Country Airplay chart in May 2013. It was co-written by the duo along with Rodney Clawson and Chris Tompkins. \"Round Here\" was released as the album's third single on June 3, 2013, and reached number one on the Country Airplay chart in September 2013. The album's fourth single, \"Stay\", was released in October 2013.  It was co-written and originally recorded by Black Stone Cherry, produced by Joey Moi and the music video featured Josh Henderson. It reached number one on the Hot Country Songs chart and the Country Airplay chart in December 2013.\nA deluxe edition of Here's to the Good Times titled Here's to the Good Times... This Is How We Roll was released on November 25, 2013.

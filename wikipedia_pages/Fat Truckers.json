    "text": "The Fat Truckers were a British electroclash group from Sheffield, comprising Ben Rymer, Mark Hudson and Ross Orton.\nThey toured in support of Jarvis Cocker, apparently wielding light sabres on stage and described themselves as writing songs about \"cheap motorbikes, import-export business and multiplex cinemas - we're a social comment on modern living\" and having a fondness of Henderson's Relish.\nThe band split up in 2004. Orton now works in production with Pulp's Steve Mackey, and has recently worked with M.I.A. Rymer DJs as part of Gucci Soundsystem and Hudson has his own band, Meat for a Dark Day.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe First Fat Truckers Album Is for Sale (2003)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Superbike\" (2001)\n\"Teenage Daughter\" (2001)\n\"Anorexic Robot\" (2003)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nLouie Austen featuring Peaches - \"Grab My Shaft\" (2003)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFat Truckers website\nThe Rapture at Reviews on NME.com\nLengthy interview and pictures from Sandman (magazine)"

Side A was a vocal track while the B side was instrumental. Through Moss' connections with Bell Records, two more singles were released on the Bell label. They changed their name to The Soul Partners and scored a local hit.\nThey changed their name in the 1970s to The Buckeye Politicians and released a single on Sceptor Records.\nLater, the band traveled to England and recorded under the direction of Alan Parsons, producing one single. An album worth of material from the Alan Parsons sessions was recorded. However, the album was never released because the tapes were lost by the airline on their return to the United States.\nThey released a single and an album on Utopia records. They released a few more singles in the 1980s.\nAs part of a 2006 reunion they recorded a CD called Here I Am.\nOriginal member Larry \"LA\" Almon died in 2008.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Original ===\nLA (Larry) Almon - Lead and Rhythm Guitar, Vocals\nJay Almon - Bass Guitar: Vocals\nRoscoe Almon - Guitar, Lead and vocals\nBobby Marsillio - Trumpet\nBuzzard - Drums\nDog - Trombone, keyboards & flute\n\n\n=== Current ===\nLA Almon - Lead and Rhythm Guitar, Vocals\nJay Almon - Bass Guitar: Vocals\nConia (sonya with a C) Almon - Vocals: (Jay Almon's daughter)\nTharon Johnson - Keyboards\nDavid Nilo - Keyboards\nMark Henderson - Percussion\nKris Keith - Tenor and Soprano Saxophone, Flute \n\n\n== US discography ==\n\n\n=== 7\" singles ===\n\"Girl I Could Love You More\" / \"I Wish It Would Rain\" - Scepter Records SCE-12301 - 1970 \n\"Dreams\" / \"Sister Rose\" - EMI 2134 - 1974 \n\n\n=== 12\" singles ===\n\"Ride On The Rhythm\" / \"Ride On The Rhythm\" (Instrumental) - Macola Record Co â€“ MRC-0946 \n\"Skin Tight\" (Radio Edit), \"Skin Tight\" (Extended Mix) / \"Skin Tight\" (Long Instrumental \n\n\n=== LP ===\nLook At Me Now - Utopia BUL1-1823 - 1976 \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

    "text": "Sexmob (also styled Sex Mob) is an American jazz band based in New York City that formed as a Knitting Factory vehicle for Steven Bernstein to exercise his slide trumpet. Sexmob's sets feature a high proportion of covers, usually familiar pop songs, which are given a humorous but avant-garde treatment. Bernstein points out that this is a return to a fundamental jazz tradition to take a familiar song and then disassemble and reassemble it.\nSexmob was Laurie Anderson's band on her 2023-2024 Let X=X tour.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDin of Inequity (Knitting Factory, 1998)\nSolid Sender (Knitting Factory, 2000)\nTheatre & Dance (2000)\nSex Mob Does Bond (Ropeadope, 2001)\nDime Grind Palace (Ropeadope, 2003)\nSexotica (Thirsty Ear, 2006)\nSexmob meets Medeski Live in Willisau 2006 (Thirsty Ear, 2009)\nSexmob Plays Fellini: Cinema, Circus & Spaghetti, the Music of Nino Rota (2013)\nCultural Capital (2017)\nThe Hard Way (Corbett vs Dempsey, 2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSteven Bernstein's Sexmob page"

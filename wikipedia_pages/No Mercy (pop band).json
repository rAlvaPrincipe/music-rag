    "text": "No Mercy is a German pop band of American singers who were originally brought together in Germany by producer Frank Farian. The group consists of Bronx-born Marty Cintron and twin brothers Ariel and Gabriel Hernández, who hailed from Miami.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1995–1997: My Promise ===\nIn 1995 the band released their single \"Missing\" which was a cover version of Everything but the Girl's 1994 hit. No Mercy released their debut album My Promise on October 21, 1996. My Promise was the original title chosen by the band's German record company, Hansa, BMG. The album was released in the U.S. only a week later under the self title No Mercy on October 29, 1996. The album, however, was released in most areas of the world with its original title My Promise, including Australia where it received two times platinum sales accreditation. My Promise which became a top-5 album in countries like Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, produced two internationally popular singles, including \"Where Do You Go\" and \"When I Die\", the first being a cover of La Bouche's \"Where Do You Go\" from 1995. This was followed by the single \"Please Don't Go\", which entered the top 5 in Austria and the U.K. The band released a re-worked version of the band Exile's number one song from 1978, \"Kiss You All Over\", which was a moderate success on the charts but still managed to enter the top 20 in Austria, the Netherlands and the UK.\n\n\n=== 1998–1999: More ===\nNo Mercy's second album, More, which was released in Germany in October 1998, included singles such as \"Hello How Are You\", \"More than a Feeling\" (originally recorded by Boston) and \"Tu Amor\" (originally by Jon B., and later covered also by RBD). Although More was not as successful as its predecessor, it still managed to achieve success in the GSA region (Germany, Switzerland, Austria), peaking at No.7, No.9, No.9 respectively.\n\n\n=== 2000–present: Singles and current status ===\nIn 2002, a single, \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\" featuring guitarist Al Di Meola, was released to gauge support for No Mercy's third album. The record producer decided instead to rework the songs for solo artist Daniel Lopes' debut album, Shine On, in 2003. The band would guest feature in that album, on the track \"Summer Angel\".\nIn October 2007, No Mercy released their third album, Day By Day, under a new Australian-based independent record label, Show No Mercy Entertainment Pty Ltd, and via iTunes.\nOn December 16, 2011 No Mercy released the single \"Shed My Skin\" featuring Stan Kolev via iTunes.\nGuitarist and lead vocalist Marty Cintron performs in Europe under the No Mercy name.\nIn 2021, Frank Farian released a cover of the eighties song Cherish by Kool & the Gang. He made also a mix version of it with the song Rivers of Babylon, on which No Mercy collaborated on.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== North American releases ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one dance hits (United States)\nList of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chart\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nnomercymusic.com Official website (in English)"

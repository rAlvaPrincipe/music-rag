    "text": "OXES is an American instrumental rock band from Baltimore. 'OXES' is a part of what is known as \"The Baltimore Rowdy Collective\" which stages practical jokes, usually involving a confrontational and outlandish racket in public places.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Live shows ===\nThe band performed at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival in Minehead, England in December 2011.\n\n\n=== The OXES/Arab on Radar split 10-inch ===\nPrior to the release of their eight-track album OXXXES in 2002, the band put out a 10-inch record, billed as a split EP between OXES and Rhode Island noise-rockers Arab on Radar. The A-side of the record was performed by OXES. However, the B-side was also OXES—this time convincingly impersonating Arab on Radar.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMarc Miller – guitar\nNatalio Fowler – guitar\nChristopher Freeland – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n(1999) Panda Strong 7-inch (Reptilian Records)\n(1999) split EP with \"Big'n\" (Box Factory Records)\n(2000) OXES (Monitor Records)\n(2000) split 10-inch with Arab on Radar (Wantage Records)\n(2002) 7-inch single \"Half Half And Half\" b/w \"Everlong\" (Monitor Records)\n(2002) OXXXES LP (Monitor Records)\n(2005) OXES EP (Monitor Records)\n(2011) \"Bile Stbudy\" 12-inch EP (Friends Records)\n(2011) \"Orange Jewelryist\" 12-inch EP (Africantape)\n(2011) \"Crunchy Zest\" 12-inch EP (Africantape)\n(2012) split 7-inch single with \"Microkingdom\" (Friends Records)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCass McCombs\nBattles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOXES' interview on Cult Cargo\nOXES\n\"Monitor Records | OXES\".

    "text": "Megumi Kanda (神田めぐみ) (born November 9, 1975) is a Japanese trombone performer.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKanda began playing trombone at the age of 10 in Tokyo, Japan. She attended the Toho High School of Music, where she won first prize in a Japanese national competition.\nAfter high school, she moved to the United States and earned a Bachelor of Music from the Cleveland Institute of Music where she studied with James DeSano, principal trombone of the Cleveland Orchestra.\nShe was first hired as a professional trombonist by the Albany Symphony Orchestra in 1997, and then worked for the Rochester Philharmonic.  From 2004 to 2008, she served on the board of directors for the International Trombone Association.\n\n\n== Current ==\nKanda is currently the principal trombonist with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra (MSO) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a position she won in 2002 (out of a field of 76 applicants for the position, only seven of whom were female).\nAndreas Delfs was the Music Director of the MSO at the time.\nMegumi Kanda is a Greenhoe Trombones Artist and Clinician. The Greenhoe Trombones company was founded by her (retired) colleague in the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, Gary Greenhoe. Kanda plays a Greenhoe GC4-1R Tenor Trombone.\nKanda is married to Dietrich Hemann, with whom she has three children.\n\n\n== Important Performances ==\nKanda has performed as a featured soloist with the following ensembles: Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, Pershing’s Own Army Band, the US Army Field Band, and the Prague Chamber Orchestra.\nKanda has also appeared as a soloist at the International Trombone Festival, American Trombone Workshop, and countless other festivals.\nKanda has premiered works that were written for her by the composers Amy Mills, Bruce Stark, and Geoffrey Gordon.\n\n\n== Books ==\nKanda has published two trombone method books, The One Hundred (2015), and Trombone Unlimited (2020). Her first book, The One Hundred, is an extensive book of common trombone excerpts. She also includes her own commentary on these excerpts. Her second, and most recent book, Trombone Unlimited, is a detailed method book that aids in technical and musical studies.\n\n\n== Teaching ==\nKanda has served as a guest faculty member at music institutions including the New World Symphony, National Youth Orchestra, Interlochen Arts Academy, and many more. She has also served as a faculty member at the Eastman School of Music Community Education Division.\n\n\n== Overcoming Adversity ==\nKanda is no stranger to performance anxiety. She used to get sick before performances, and would develop painful cold sores in her mouth. “I loved playing but the side effects of performing were torturing me,” Kanda reported.\nDuring Kanda’s time at the Cleveland Institute of Music, she suffered an excruciating embouchure overuse injury. She was unable to play at all. However, her teacher, James DeSano, coached her through her injury, and back to health. Megumi now believes that her injury is “the best thing that ever happened to [her].” She developed a new appreciation for music, and a newfound love for her instrument without any outside pressure.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nConsul General of Japan at Chicago — Certificate of Commendation, recognized for her contribution to the friendship between the United States and Japan\nArion Foundation (Tokyo, Japan) — 2006 Recognition as one of the most influential Japanese classical artists\nMilwaukee Business Journal — 2017 Woman of Influence, Education Leadership\nInternational Trombone Association — 2020 International Trombone Association Award\n\n\n== Discography ==\nKanda has released three solo albums: Amazing Grace, Gloria, and Mona Lisa.\nKanda is featured on the following albums (all tracks of each album, unless otherwise noted).\n\n\n== References =="

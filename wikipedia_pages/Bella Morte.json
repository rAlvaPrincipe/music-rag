    "text": "Bella Morte is a gothic rock band formed in 1996 in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States. They incorporate elements of metal, dark wave, deathrock, alternative, and synthpop. The band's name means \"Beautiful Death\" in Italian language. According to the band's vocalist, Andy Deane, the name was chosen to suggest that \"beauty can be found in tragedy\", which is a re-occurring theme in Bella Morte's albums.\nIn 2002, they signed with Metropolis Records having previously self-released albums through their own label, Some Wear Leather, and, also, Cleopatra Records. In early fall 2006, Metropolis Records announced that Bella Morte had reached number one on the company's pre-order sales list with their new album, Bleed the Grey Sky Black, which was released on October 10, 2006.\nThe bass guitarist and co-founder Gopal Metro decided to leave the band, playing his last show on March 10, 2007, in Charlottesville. At the same show, the vocalist Andy Deane announced that Tony Pugh would replace Metro. At the beginning of summer 2008, it was announced that Jordan Marchini would not be touring with the band any longer. Nevertheless, he returned in 2011.\n\n\n== Current Band Members ==\nAndy Deane – vocals\n\n\n== Former Band Members ==\nGopal Metro – bass\nTony Lechmanski – guitars\nMarshall Camden – bass\nTony Pugh – bass\nJordan Marchini – drums\nBranden Shores – drums\nScotty Derrico – drums\nClay Caricofe – drums\nChris \"Frizzle\" – guitars\nBn Whitlow – guitars\nMicah Consylman – keyboards (mainly the keytar during live performance)\nJames Warnock – keyboards, lighting\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Full releases ===\nRemorse (cassette only, demo) (1996)\nRemains (1997)\nWhere Shadows Lie (2000)\nThe Death Rock EP (Vinyl – limited to 300) (2001)\nThe Quiet (2002)\nThe Death Rock EP (CD w/ bonus tracks) (2002)\nRemains (Remastered Version) (2002)\nAs the Reasons Die (2004)\nSongs for the Dead (2004)\nBleed The Grey Sky Black (2006)\nBeautiful Death (October 7, 2008)\nBefore the Flood (June 14, 2011)\nRare and Unreleased, volume 1 (February 14, 2012)\nThe Best of Bella Morte 1996–2012 (June 25, 2013)\nExorcisms (2014)\nYear of the Ghost (August 14, 2017)\n\n\n=== Side projects ===\nAndy Deane released a solo album as \"The Rain Within\", a reference to the Bella Morte's song \"The Rain Within Her Hands\", in 2010 titled Pain Management.\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nThe Pink and The Black (1998) (Delinquent Records) – \"One Winter's Night\"\nThe Unquiet Grave Vol 1 (1998) (Cleopatra Records) – \"Funeral Night\"\nMusic from the Succubus Club (2000) (Dancing Ferret Discs) – \"Fall No More\"\nThe Darkest Millennium (2000) (Cleopatra Records) – \"The Rain Within Her Hands\"\nA Gothic-Industrial Tribute to Smashing Pumpkins (2001) (Cleopatra Records) – \"Soma\"\nNew Dark Noise (2002) (Cleopatra Records) – \"Relics\"\nElectronic Saviors Volume 2: Recurrence (2012) (Metropolis Records) – \"Lost\"\nElectronic Saviors Volume 3: Remission (2014) (Metropolis Records) – \"The One Beside Me\"\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\"In The Dirt\" directed by Lloyd Kaufman was filmed on February 20, 2010, at Con Nooga in Chattanooga, Tennessee\n\"Find Forever Gone\" directed by Eric Thomas Craven.

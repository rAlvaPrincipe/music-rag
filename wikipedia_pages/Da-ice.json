    "text": "Da-ice (ダイス, Daisu, stylized as Da-iCE and pronounced \"dice\"), is a Japanese boy band. The group consists of five members: Yudai Ohno, Toru Iwaoka, Taiki Kudo, Sota Hanamura, and Hayate Wada. They were formerly signed to Universal Sigma until they transferred to Avex Trax in June 2020. They are currently managed by Avex Management Inc.\n\n\n== Name ==\nDespite the hyphen in the group's name, it is pronounced as \"dice\". Five sides of a die represent the members, while the last side represents the fans. The \"a-i\" in the name is intentionally spelt in lowercase, as \"ai\" means love in the Japanese language.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2011–2014: Formation and early years ===\nIn January 2011, Yudai Ohno, Toru Iwaoka, Taiki Kudo, Sota Hanamura, and Hayate Wada were gathered and formed into a group by their current manager. The group, initially named Blackout, soon decided to change their names because \"blackout\" meant a power outage. In April, they held their first concert in Shibuya Vuenos.\nFrom May to September 2012, Da-ice performed as the opening act for their agency mates AAA in \"AAA Tour 2012 -777- Triple Seven\". This significantly widened their exposure to the public, and by the end of the tour their Twitter followers had grown from about 2,000 to over 10,000. On 12 December 2012, the group released their self-titled debut indie mini-album. It ranked 1st on the Recochoku ringtone daily chart, and reached a peak of number 15 on the Oricon Daily Albums Chart.\nFollowing the release of the album, Da-ice held their first tour in January 2013. In May of the same year, they held their second tour. On 5 June 2013, they released their first indie single, \"I'll Be Back\". The single ranked number 14 on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, and achieved number one on the Recochoku ringtone daily chart. In July, they announced they would be making their debut in 2014, and in October, it was announced that a nationwide online vote would determine their debut single.

On 1 February 2016, it was announced that Da-iCE would perform their first Hall Tour across Japan starting in July, with its final stop at Tokyo Nippon Budokan on 1 January 2017. This would be the first time the group had performed at an Arena as a solo act. On 8 February, they wrapped up their third tour with a surprise announcement of their single \"Watch Out\", and their third concert live DVD Da-ice Live House Tour 2015–2016: Phase 4 Hello, released simultaneously on 6 April 2016.

The third live DVD featured the semi-final performance in Tokyo at the Toyosu PIT on 31 January 2016, and included a limited edition one hour recording called \"the Road to Nippon Budokan\". \nOn December 22, 2021, the group released their single \"liveDevil\", which serves as the opening theme song for the 32nd entry of the Kamen Rider series, Kamen Rider Revice. The song featured additional vocals from Subaru Kimura, who also voiced one of Revice's main characters. The side B of the single featured \"Promise\", the ending song for the movie \"Kamen Rider: Beyond Generations\". On 30 December, their single \"Citrus\" won the Grand Prix at the 63rd Japan Record Awards.\nThe group is featured as the fictional boy band 4*Town in the Japanese dub of the 2022 Pixar film Turning Red.

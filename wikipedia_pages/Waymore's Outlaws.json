    "text": "The Waylors, later Waymore's Outlaws,  is a country music band, best known as the backing and recording band of country music singer Waylon Jennings.  Jennings formed the band in 1961, consisting of Jerry Gropp on the guitar and\nRichie Albright on the drums after moving to Phoenix, Arizona. The band earned a local fan base during its appearances on the night club JD's.\nIn 1965 RCA Records signed Jennings to a contract. The conservative restrictions of the producers of the label did not allow him to record with the Waylors, due to the Nashville custom of the time using session musicians instead of a performer's backup band. In 1972 he renegotiated his contract, and he included the Waylors for the first time on a RCA album in Honky Tonk Heroes. The lineup was expanded during the next decade, they backed Jennings until his death in 2002.\nReformed in 2008, the group performs on its own with Tommy Townsend as their lead vocalist, with occasional performances as the band for Albright's namesake, Waylon Albright \"Shooter\" Jennings, the son of Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWaylon Jennings was managed at the beginning of his career by Buddy Holly's first manager, 'Hi-Pockets' Duncan. On Duncan's recommendation, Holly hired Jennings to play electric bass for him during his \"Winter Dance Party Tour\" in 1959.\nAfter a show in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly chartered a plane for himself, Allsup and Jennings to avoid a long bus trip to  Fargo, North Dakota. This is because the tour organizers provided very inadequate transportation & the buses broke down in freezing weather. Jennings gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson, who was suffering from a cold and complaining about how uncomfortable a long bus trip was for a man of his size.  During the early morning hours of February 3, 1959, later known as The Day the Music Died, the charter crashed outside Clear Lake, killing all on board.  Jennings and Allsup continued the tour for two more weeks, featuring Jennings as the lead singer. When the tour ended, he returned to his DJ spot on KLLL and performed regionally.\n\n\n== Phoenix and the Nashville sound ==\nIn 1961, Jennings lived briefly in Coolidge, Arizona working in radio, before moving to Phoenix, where he formed The Waylors, consisting of Jerry Gropp on the guitar and Richie Albright on the drums.\nJennings and his band performed at a newly opened nightspot called JD's. The band earned a small fan base, eventually signing with the independent label Trend Records. In 1963, Jennings signed a contract with A&M Records. Jennings and The Waylors recorded an album on BAT called Waylon at JD's. Singer Bobby Bare, who covered Ian Tyson's \"Four Strong Winds\" and Jennings' \"Just To Satisfy You\", recommended Jennings to producer Chet Atkins, who signed Jennings to RCA Victor in 1965.\nJennings was accustomed to performing and recording with his own band, The Waylors, a practice that was discouraged or forbidden by powerful Nashville producers. Over time, however, Jennings felt limited by the Nashville sound's lack of artistic freedom. The music style publicized as \"Countrypolitan\" was characterized by orchestral arrangements, and the absence (or minor use) of traditional country music instruments. By 1972 he renegotiated his contract with RCA, that gave him complete creative control over his works.  For the recording session, Jennings replaced the typical studio musicians of Nashville sessions with his band.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nBy the 1980s the lineup included the additions of Ralph Mooney from The Strangers, Johnny Gimble, Rance Wasson, Gordon Payne, Jerry Bridges, Barney Robertson and Carter Robertson.\nMooney retired in 1996 and was initially replaced by Fred Newell, an established Nashville studio player, followed by Robby Turner, who Waylon first worked with as part of the Highwaymen touring band.  The band backed Jennings until 1999 when he formed a short-time project, The Waymore Blues Band, which was Jennings' \"hand-picked dream team.\" Waymore Blues Band backed him until his death.\n Now known as Waymore's Outlaws, the band continues today, with Tommy Townsend as lead guitar and vocalist.  In 2014, the Outlaws came full circle by playing with Waylon's son and Richie Albright's namesake Waylon Albright \"Shooter\" Jennings for the first time on tour.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCarr, Joseph; Munde, Alan (1997).

    "text": "Starling Glow is a pop/rock band from Orange County, California fronted by singer/songwriter Liz Hill.\n\n\n== Background ==\nLiz Hill grew up in a musical family and was influenced by a wide range of musical genres. During her college years, Liz listened to more Top 40 radio and found a new appreciation for melody and lyrics. She started to admire artists who were able to crossover between rock and pop genres. This inspired her to blur the lines and cross between alternative rock, pop and dance with her single \"We Are Infinite.\"\n\"We Are Infinite\" originally debuted at #40 on Billboard's Club Chart before peaking at #19. We Are Infinite reached #39 on the Mediabase Top 40 radio chart as of June 21, 2014.\nStarling Glow's debut album is set to be released soon and reflects Liz's musical taste by combining rock-and-roll roots with electronic, dance and indie influences. The album was produced by Grammy nominated producer, songwriter and musician Billy Mohler who has worked with artists like Lifehouse, Kelly Clarkson and The Smashing Pumpkins. Starling Glow also worked with drummer Josh Freese who has played with Evanescence and Guns N' Roses, as well as Colbie Caillat, and Matthew Chamberlain who is known for his work with Kanye West, John Mayer and Sara Bareilles.\nStarling Glow's musical style has been compared to the likes of Paramore, Ellie Goulding and Foxes.\n\n\n== \"We Are Infinite\" Single ==\n\"We Are Infinite\" is the first single off Starling Glow's self-titled debut album. It was the last track that was written for the album and is about seizing the moment and feeling unstoppable and infinite.

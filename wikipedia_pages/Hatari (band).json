    "text": "Hatari (Icelandic pronunciation: [ˈhaːtarɪ]; lit. 'Hater') are an Icelandic techno, industrial and punk rock band and performance art group from Reykjavík. Their public image incorporates elements of anti-capitalism and BDSM attire. The band currently consists of Klemens Hannigan, Einar Stefánsson and Davíð Katrínarson, the latter of whom replacing original member Matthías Haraldsson in 2023. They have released an album and an extended play, encompassing several singles. Hatari represented Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 with their song \"Hatrið mun sigra\", finishing tenth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history (2015–2018) ===\nHatari was formed in mid-2015 by cousins Klemens Hannigan and Matthías Haraldsson. At the time, Klemens had begun writing electronic music that Matthías would provide screaming vocals for. Klemens later presented the songs to Einar Stefánsson, who joined the duo as their drummer. Klemens and Einar, together with drummer Sólrún Mjöll Kjartansdóttir, had previously also formed the band Kjurr in late 2012; in the band, Klemens played the guitar and provided vocals, while Einar played the bass. Throughout 2016, Hatari performed five times, including appearances in Reykjavík, at Eistnaflug, at LungA Festival, and at Norðanpaunk, prior to their break-out performances at Iceland Airwaves, held at Kex Hostel in Reykjavík, on 31 October and 6 November 2016. The band's debut extended play (EP), named Neysluvara, was released through Svikamylla ehf. via Spotify and Bandcamp on 31 October 2017. Leading up to the EP's release, the band also released music videos for two songs from the EP, \"Ódýr\" and \"X\". In December 2017, Hatari was featured on the song \"Hlauptu\", released on the album Horror by Cyber.\nOn 21 December 2018, Hatari announced that the board of directors of Svikamylla ehf. had passed a resolution to dissolve the band. However, Hatari did not dissolve as they appeared at Eurosonic Noorderslag, a music event held in the Netherlands, shortly after that. Simultaneous to the dissolution announcement, Hatari released the music video for a new single, \"Spillingardans\".\n\n\n=== Eurovision Song Contest (2019) ===\nIn January 2019, Hatari was confirmed as one of the ten acts competing in Söngvakeppnin 2019, Iceland's national selection for its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, with their new song \"Hatrið mun sigra\". Hatari won Söngvakeppnin 2019 in March that year, and thus represented Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest in May.\nIn the lead-up to the competition, Hatari made headlines with a number of political statements over the Israeli occupation of Palestine and other matters, resulting in Jon Ola Sand, the executive supervisor of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), warning them that they had reached the limit of the EBU's patience, and would be disqualified should they choose to bring its political statements to the stage. However, when Iceland's televote score was announced at the end of the final, members of Hatari held up banners displaying the flag of Palestine. As a result, the EBU imposed on RÚV the minimum possible fine of €5,000. Overall, Hatari received 232 points in the final, finishing in 10th place.\n\n\n=== Subsequent releases and tours (2019–present) ===\nOn 23 May 2019, the day of their homecoming concert, Hatari released \"Klefi / Samed\", a single featuring Palestinian musician Bashar Murad, with a music video. The video was filmed in the desert by Jericho, Palestine, and the song features lyrics in Icelandic and Arabic. A further single, \"Klámstrákur\", was released that October. Hatari's first album, Neyslutrans, was released on 17 January 2020, also featuring the four prior singles. A remix album, Neyslutrans Remixed, was released on 19 February 2021.\nOn 17 July 2019, Hatari announced their 2020 \"Europe Will Crumble\" tour, with Cyber as their supporting act. On 29 January 2020, a few hours before their  concert at the Copenhagen venue Vega, a fire broke out, but nobody was hurt. The second of two tour legs was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was replaced by the \"Dance or Die\" tour, which was announced in November 2020 and advertised with a \"post-human experience\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nHatari primarily consists of musicians Klemens Hannigan, Davíð Katrínarson, and Einar Stefánsson, as well as several contributors.\n\n\n=== Klemens Hannigan ===\n\nKlemens Nikulásson Hannigan (born 20 December 1994) is the group's vocalist and is the cousin of Matthías.

    "text": "Shai (pronounced \"shy\") is an American vocal R&B/soul quartet that rose to prominence in the 1990s. The group met and formed on the campus of Howard University, influenced by the vocal stylings of Boyz II Men, Jodeci, and Color Me Badd, among others. The group remains best known for their 1992 debut single \"If I Ever Fall in Love,\" which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early beginnings and formation ===\nShai (a Swahili word meaning \"personification of destiny\")  was formed on the campus of Howard University. In 1990, Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. brothers, Marc Gay, Carl Martin, and Darnell Van Rensalier invited fellow Howard University student Garfield Bright to join their a capella group after two other founding members departed.  None of the members had professional singing experience and mostly performed in and around campus for fun, according to Gay.    \nThe group came together seriously after winning a Howard University talent show.[1]  From there, they decided to pursue a record deal in New York City but did not receive any offers.  Martin later gave Paco Lopez, a local deejay at WPGC radio in Washington, a demo cassette copy of \"If I Ever Fall in Love,\" and he began promoting the single on the air.  In September 1992, the group signed with Gasoline Alley/MCA Records and released their debut album later that year.  \n\n\n=== 1992-1993: If I Ever Fall In Love and Right Back at Cha ===\nShai released \"If I Ever Fall in Love\" as the first single from the debut album of the same title, which peaked at No. 2 in the U.S. and sold over two million copies.  The next two releases from the platinum album, \"Comforter\" and \"Baby I'm Yours\", each peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. \nAt the insistence of the group members, the video for \"Baby I'm Yours\" was shot on the Howard University campus.[2]  The female love interests, including future television host and model Ananda Lewis, and many of the extras were actual Howard students.  \nThe group's next album release was Right Back at Cha, a remix album that largely consisted of new versions of their previous hits and a couple of new songs.  A completely reworked version of their previous hit, \"Baby I'm Yours,\" simply titled \"Yours,\" was released as a single (US No. 63).\nIn 1993, the group won an NAACP Image Award (Outstanding New Artist), and they performed at Bill Clinton's inauguration along with Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Ray Charles, and Diana Ross, among others. Additionally, Shai appeared on The Arsenio Hall Show and The Tonight Show.\n\n\n=== 1994-2001 ===\nAt the beginning of 1994, Shai made a guest appearance on the sitcom \"Family Matters\" in the episode, \"Good Cop, Bad Cop\", in a dream sequence.\nThe group released \"The Place Where You Belong,\" from the Beverly Hills Cop III soundtrack. It was the group's final Top 40 single (No. 32 R&B). In late 1995, their follow-up album Blackface was released (No. 42 Pop & No. 15 R&B). It featured their final R&B Top 20 single \"Come with Me\" (US No. 43). The 1996 remix, \"I Don't Wanna Be Alone\" (featuring Jay-Z), peaked at No. 89 in the U.S. It was inspired by Belinda Carlisle's \"Heaven Is a Place on Earth.\"\n\"Song For You\" by Rick Braun, featuring Shai, peaked at No. 39 on the R&B chart in 2001.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n20th Century Masters â€“ The Millennium Collection: The Best of Shai (2001)\nIf I Ever Fall in Love: The Best Of (3 re-recorded tracks from the original album) (2011)\nIf I Ever Fall in Love: Greatest Hits (same 3 tracks re-recorded with new members Dwayne Jones & George Spencer III) (2011)\nIn Concert (2018)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nVideo Personification: Vol. 1 (1993)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nNAACP Image Awards (1993), Outstanding new artist - winner\nSoul Train Music Awards (1993), Best New R&B/Soul Artist - nominee\n\n\n== References =="

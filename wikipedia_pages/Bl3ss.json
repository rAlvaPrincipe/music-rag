They then performed in clubs and at festivals.\nIn 2024, Bl3ss released the song Kisses together with CamrinWatsin feat. bbyclose, which went viral and earned them a chart position in the German and British singles charts. In the British charts, it reached the top 10 at number 5 and was a hot candidate for Song of the Summer, but then only ranked at number 25.

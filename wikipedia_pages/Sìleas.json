    "text": "Sìleas (pronounced sheelis) is a Scottish harp duo. Patsy Seddon plays electric harp and gut-strung harp, and Mary Macmaster plays electric harp and metal-strung harp. They sing in Gaelic and English.\nThe name of the band is explained on the back cover of the debut album, Delighted with Harps. Sìleas na Ceapaich was an 18th-century Gaelic poet. Her praise of harp music led Seddon and Macmaster to take \"Sìleas\" as their professional name.\nThey were inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDelighted with Harps (Lapwing, 1986 )\nBeating Harps (Green Linnet, 1987)\nHarpbreakers (1990)\nFile Under Christmas (1991)\nPlay on Light (1996)\n\n\n== References =="

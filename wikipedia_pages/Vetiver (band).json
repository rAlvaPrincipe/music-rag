    "text": "Vetiver is an American folk band headed by songwriter Andy Cabic.\n\n\n== History ==\nVetiver was formed in San Francisco in 2002.  The band released their self-titled debut album in 2004 on the small indie folk label DiCristina. Since the album's release, Vetiver has toured extensively, opening for and collaborating with Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom. Vetiver released another album, To Find Me Gone, on DiCristina in 2006. Banhart and Cabic also launched their own label, Gnomonsong Recordings, releasing Jana Hunter's Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom in 2005 and There's No Home in 2007. The label also released in 2008 Vetiver's Thing of the Past, a collection of cover songs that have influenced Cabic's aesthetic. Sub Pop Records (US) and Bella Union (UK) released Vetiver's Tight Knit (2009) The Errant Charm (2011), and Complete Strangers (2015).\nThe band shared the bill with Vashti Bunyan on her US tour in early 2007. Over the years, the band has toured with artists like Fleet Foxes, The Shins, Fruit Bats and Wilco.\nCabic's music has also been featured in numerous TV commercials, including an original song for Birds Eye. He also works as a composer, including the documentary The Family Jams and the film Smashed, which was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nVetiver (DiCristina, 2004)\nTo Find Me Gone (DiCristina, FatCat, 2006)\nThing of the Past (Gnomonsong / FatCat, 2008)\nTight Knit (Sub Pop / Bella Union, 2009)\nThe Errant Charm (Sub Pop / Bella Union, 2011)\nComplete Strangers (Easy Sound, 2015)\nUp on High (Mama Bird / Loose Music, 2019)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nBetween (DiCristina, 2005)\n\"You May Be Blue\" (Gnomonsong, 2008)\n\"More of the Past\" (Gnomonsong, 2008)\n\n\n=== Other contributions ===\nAcoustic 07 (V2 Records, 2007) - \"Been So Long\"\nThe Believer 2004 Music Issue - \"Be Kind to Me\"\nThe Golden Apples Of The Sun (Bastet, 2004) – \"Angel's Share\"\nJohnny Boy Would Love This...A Tribute to John Martyn (Hole in the Rain Music, 2011) – \"Go Easy\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nThere’s no place like home MSNBC Interview, May 25, 2006.\nIndie Music Pick: Vetiver Audio review on Weekend America, July 29, 2006.

    "text": "The Widespread Depression Orchestra was a nine-piece jazz ensemble founded in 1972 at Vermont's Marlboro College.\nInitially, the group played 1950s style R&B and early rock and roll with guitars, piano, sax, bass guitar, drums, and a vocalist, but by the middle of the 1970s was operating as a big band revival group, in the style of the bands of Jimmie Lunceford, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Lionel Hampton. The unit moved to New York City in 1978 under the leadership of Jon Holtzman, when it recorded the first of several full-length albums. In 1980 five of its members also played on their own as a bebop group.\nHoltzman - better known as The Bronx Nightingale, left the group around 1982 to start his own band and recorded his first solo album - Let's Do It.  John Hammond Sr., a big fan of Jon's, graciously volunteered to write the liner notes. After Holtzman left Michael Hashim, the group's alto saxophonist, was named leader, and the musicians broadened their repertory to include swing and bop, featuring original arrangements by band members. Manager Michael Caplin renamed the group the Widespread Jazz Orchestra. WJO played at premier jazz clubs across America and around the world, and appeared at major music festivals including North Sea, Pori, Antibes, New Orleans, Montreal, Montreux + Taormina.  Their 1985 Columbia Records album Paris Blues, was produced by Dr. George Butler.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nWidespread Depression Orchestra\n\nDowntown Uproar, Stash (1979); OCLC 6360561\nBoogie in the Barnyard, Stash (1980); OCLC 8007049\nRockin' in Rhythm, Phontastic (nl) (Swd) PHONT 7527 (1980); OCLC 16909745\nTime to Jump and Shout, Stash ST 212 (1981); OCLC 8246038\nWidespread Jazz Orchestra\n\nSwing is the Thing, Adelphi AD 5015 (1982); OCLC 9797724\nParis Blues, Columbia Col FC 40034 (1984); OCLC 12400344\n\n\n== Members ==\nAt large\n\nBy record\n\n\n== References ==\nGary W.

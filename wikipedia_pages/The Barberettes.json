    "text": "The Barberettes (Korean: 바버렛츠) is a South Korean retro, doo-wop female group that debuted in 2014 as a trio, and is based in Seoul.  With their covers and original music, they reproduce the sound of the 50s-60s music, and are referred to as a time slip girl group who travel back to the times of barbershop music and harmonizing girl groups. The group is composed of Shinae An Wheeler (Korean: 안신애) and Seon (or Sunnie) Lee Kyeong (Korean: 이경선). In 2019 The Barberettes and Sweet Sorrow form a harmony collab group SBSB (Korean: 스바스바).\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe group started singing, as a trio, for fun in October 2012, when Wheeler had the idea of creating a retro-inspired girl group.  Wheeler and Grace Kim were already singing solo for the same jazz band, and Park began taking vocal lessons from Wheeler. They performed at a number of places, including the indie music venues in the Hongdae area near Hongik University in Seoul, and for audiences of the older Korean generation, releasing their first album on May 27, 2014.\nThe name \"Barberettes\" was chosen because they wanted to name themselves after the a cappella barbershop music style, hoping to use a name like \"Barbershop Quartet\", but lacking a fourth member, they added the suffix \"ettes\", like many girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s.\nThey often use one microphone for performances, initially to imitate that era's girl groups, but later realizing the advantage when they found they could hear each other better, which helped them control the harmony balance. They also use costumes, make-up and choreography to re-create the effect.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\n\nThey described their music as \"Korean doo-wop done in the 21st century\". They were inspired by doo-wop, Motown, barbershop, and pop music that was created prior to the 1960s, and also by groups like The Andrews Sisters, The Chordettes, and The Ronettes, to whom they have been compared.\nThey gave credit to the 1960s Korean girl group Korean Kittens, and especially The Kim Sisters, whom they discovered on YouTube, as having a large effect on them, and call them their \"biggest idols\".  They said they were stunned by the performances of the Kim Sisters, who did not receive a lot of recognition in Korea until recently, but were signed with Motown, and performed on The Ed Sullivan Show many times.\nBecause of the group's performances in indie venues they are often referred to as an indie pop group. Their musical style has been described as \"giving a glimpse into what K-pop might have been like in the 1950s with their styling and song choice\".\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Original three ===\nShinae An Wheeler, the group's creator, producer, leader, guitarist, main composer and writer was born July 30, 1986, in Seongnam.

She trained on classical piano, violin and flute, and from 2011 to 2014 studied at Chung-Ang University.  She was active in the indie-jazz scene as a lead vocalist in a 12-piece Korean jazz band called JHG (Just Hip'n Groovy), whose band leader was Jung Jung Hwa, a professor of Seoul Institute of the Arts.  She was the group's vocalist usually singing the higher notes in the harmonies, and said of herself, \"I am the playful one with a big smile.\"\nSo Hee Park was born on April 10, 1991, in Suwon She played piano since a very young age and started studying modern contemporary music in 2011 at Sungshin Women's University.

    "text": "Casiopea (カシオペア, Kashiopea, derived from the name of the constellation Cassiopeia), now known in its fourth iteration as Casiopea-P4, is a Japanese jazz fusion band formed in 1976 by guitarist Issei Noro, bassist Tetsuo Sakurai, drummer Tohru \"Rika\" Suzuki, and keyboardist Hidehiko Koike. In 1977, keyboardist Minoru Mukaiya and drummer Takashi Sasaki (ja) replaced Koike and Suzuki respectively. They recorded their debut album Casiopea (1979) with guest appearances by American jazz musicians Randy Brecker, Michael Brecker, and David Sanborn. In 1980, drummer Akira Jimbo joined the band. Casiopea has released over 40 albums in Japan and around the world.\nStarting from 2012, they formed Casiopea 3rd as a spin-off from the original, featuring Kiyomi Otaka on keyboards and returning members, Issei Noro, Akira Jimbo, and Yoshihiro Naruse.\nOn July 1, 2022, it was announced that Yoshinori Imai would be the band's new drummer after Akira Jimbo left Casiopea 3rd, and the band would be rebranded as Casiopea-P4.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Casiopea 1st (1976–1989) ===\nOne of the band's earliest appearances was at Yamaha's amateur band contest \"EastWest '76\" (ja), featuring Issei Noro, Tetsuo Sakurai, Hidehiko Koike, and Tohru \"Rika\" Suzuki. This was Casiopea's original formation, and both Koike and Suzuki left the band due to being busy with other projects at the time (Suzuki joining Prism, and Koike in other bands). They finally got their first permanent formation when Takashi Sasaki replaced Suzuki on Drums and Minoru Mukaiya replaced Koike on Keyboards in 1977. They would re-appear in the \"YAMAHA EastWest '77\" contest at this time, and they later made their official live debut in January 1978. Around this time, musicians like Prism guitarist Akira Wada, keyboardist Jun Fukamachi, guitarist Kenji Omura and others in the Japanese Fusion scene frequently appeared with the band as supporting members/special guests in some of their live performances (with their appearances ranging from 1977 to 1979, and 1980 for some). The first label to sign them was Alfa Records, which released their album Casiopea, which was released in May 1979, featuring the Brecker brothers and David Sanborn as the brass section. They would also release the album Super Flight later that same year. After the end of the Super Flight tour in January 1980, Sasaki left the band and Akira Jimbo would fill the drummer seat in the following month. \"Galactic Funk\" first appeared on Cross Point (1981) with ten different versions recorded both live and in studio.  The album Eyes of the Mind was released in 1981, followed by the release of Mint Jams (1982), and 4x4, which was recorded with Lee Ritenour, Harvey Mason, Nathan East, and Don Grusin. The band's first overseas concert was in the United Kingdom in 1983, they since toured in Europe, South America, Australia, and Southeast Asia respectively. In 1987, Casiopea signed to Polydor. In 1989, Akira Jimbo and Tetsuo Sakurai, who played drums and bass, respectively, as part of the first \"Classic Lineup\" of Casiopea, split and recruited other musicians, including city pop singers Yurie Kokubu (ja) and Kaoru Akimoto (ja), to form Shambara (ja) the same year. The band dissolved after releasing one album, and the two formed the duo Jimsaku in 1990.\n\n\n=== Casiopea 2nd (1990–2006) ===\nWith only Issei Noro and Minoru Mukaiya remaining from the original Casiopea lineup, bassist Yoshihiro Naruse replaced Sakurai and drummer Masaaki Hiyama replaced Jimbo. Casiopea then signed to Pioneer. In August 1992, Hiyama left the band due to health issues, and drummer Noriaki Kumagai replaced him later that year, first appearing in the album Dramatic in 1993, and the band returned to the Alfa label that year, then to Pony Canyon. In 1997, Jimbo returned as a part-time member, recording more albums and writing compositions. This would become Casiopea's longest running line-up in the band's history (guitarist Issei Noro, keyboardist Minoru Mukaiya, and bassist Yoshihiro Naruse, with drummers Masaaki Hiyama from 1990 to 1992, Noriaki Kumagai from 1993 to 1996, and the returning Akira Jimbo from 1997 to 2006).\nIn 2000, the band again signed to Pioneer, who would release their 20th Anniversary album (featuring Noro, Mukaiya, Jimbo and Naruse, with former members consisting of Kumagai, Koike, and Sakurai). Four years later Pioneer changed its name to Geneon Entertainment. On August 1, 2006, Issei Noro, the group's leader, decided to freeze all activities of the band until further notice.\n\n\n=== Hiatus (2006–2012) ===\nIn 2008, Issei Noro formed the fusion band Inspirits.\nIn January 2009, Minoru Mukaiya collaborated with Super Bell\"Z in the album Tetsudou Seminar Ongakuhen, based on Ongakukan's Tetsudou Seminar video game series.\nOn May 27, 2009, a limited-edition box set, Legend of Casiopea, was released to commemorate the band's thirtieth anniversary.\n\n\n=== Casiopea 3rd (2012–2022) ===\nOn April 20, 2012, the formation of Casiopea 3rd was announced with Kiyomi Otaka joining on keyboards, replacing Minoru Mukaiya, who led his own music production team Mukaiya Club.\nThroughout the 2010s, Casiopea 3rd would resume album releases, with both Casiopea 3rd and Inspirits holding a joint concert as a result of having a common bandleader in Issei Noro.\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis, Issei Noro released a song titled A·RI·GA·TO (Appreciation), thanking all those on the frontlines.\nOn February 10, 2022, Akira Jimbo announced he would be leaving Casiopea 3rd. His final appearance with Casiopea 3rd was during the April and May 2022 Billboard Tour.\n\n\n=== Casiopea-P4 (2022–present) ===\nOn July 1, 2022, Issei Noro announced on the band's website that Yoshinori Imai would be the new drummer, and the band would rebrand to Casiopea-P4. The recording sessions for their first Casiopea-P4 album, New Topics, started just weeks after the rebrand. They released another album in 2024 named Right Now. In December 2024, Kiyomi Otaka announced that she would graduate from the band, after 12 years as Casiopea's keyboardist.\n\n\n== Offshoot bands ==\n\n\n=== Shambara/Jimsaku/Katsushika Trio ===\nIn 1989, Akira Jimbo and Tetsuo Sakurai formed another group, Shambara, with Kaoru Akimoto and Yurie Kokubu on Vocals, Ryo Kunihiko on keyboards, and Nozomi Furukawa on Guitar. Shambara released one self titled album and split the same year. Jimbo and Sakurai were then given the option of returning to Casiopea, but ultimately decided to continue as the drum and bass duo, Jimsaku. Over the course of the 90s, Jimsaku released 9 Studio Albums and one Live. Akira Jimbo returned to Casiopea in 1997, and thus Jimsaku disbanded.\nJimsaku reunited for a new album in 2021. Just a few months later, Keyboardist Minoru Mukaiya, who had played with Jimsaku previously within Casiopea, joined them and formed the \"Katsushika Trio\" in 2021. They held concerts since 2021 playing their classic Casiopea hits. Katsushika Trio's first completely new song, \"Red Express\" was released on June 29, 2022. Their first album, MRI Mirai, was released on October 25, 2023. They followed it up with a new album, Uchuu no Abarenbou (with its English Name officially translated as Wild Guys in the Universe) on September 11, 2024.\n\n\n=== Ottottrio ===\nIn 1987, T-Square guitarist Masahiro Andoh, Issei Noro and guitarist Hirokuni Korekata (who later formed KoreNoS and Rocket Jam, both bands with T-Square Bassists and Drummers) created a supergroup called Ottottrio. With a backing band composed by drummer Hiroyuki Noritake, keyboardists Chizuko Yoshihiro and Shotoku Sasaji, and bassist Chiharu Mikuzuki, the group released 3 albums, 2 in 1988 and one called \"Triptych\" in 1998. In 1989, Ottottrio and their backing players performed with T-Square and Casiopea on the joint event \"The Super Fusion\". They also reunited briefly for T-Square's 35th Anniversary in 2013.\n\n\n=== Casiopea vs. The Square ===\nAfter Ottottrio, the relationship between Casiopea and T-Square continued in 1993, when former T-Square percussionist Kiyohiko Semba played on one of the songs from Casiopea's album \"Dramatic\", and, a year later, the bands played together an arrangement of The Beatles \"Get Back\" on a Japanese Broadcast. In 1997, Casiopea, T-Square and Jimsaku played at Tokyo Jam, and in 2003 both groups played (with some of the players replaced), at the event Casiopea vs. The Square itself. More recently they still have somewhat of an alliance, seeing as Casiopea's former drummer Noriaki Kumagai and T-Square's former bassist Mitsuru Sutoh are both in group TRIX, and T-Square Sax/EWI player Takeshi Itoh performed with Casiopea's former keyboardist Minoru Mukaiya in 2006.\n\n\n=== Synchronized DNA ===\nIn 2004, Akira Jimbo and Hiroyuki Noritake created a Drum Duo called Synchronized DNA, who played in a tour with Casiopea, released the next year as \"Casiopea + Sync DNA: 5 Stars Live\", and in their last album before hiatus, \"Signal\".\n\n\n=== Inspirits ===\nIn 2008, Issei Noro created the band Issei Noro Inspirits, with Akira Jimbo, pianist Kent Ohgiya, keyboardist Ryo Hayashi and bassist Yuji Yajima as members. As of November 21, 2018, they have released six studio albums, two live albums, and two live videos.\n\n\n=== Pegasus ===\nIn 2009, a director from Tetsuo Sakurai's record company suggested him to make an album for the 30th anniversary of his career, released as My Dear Musiclife. Sakurai accepted his idea but the director asked him to record \"Domino Line\" in it, as he played that song as Casiopea's Bassist (throughout 1979 to 1989). Sakurai asked the writer of that song, Issei Noro for permission; Noro agreed but he said he wouldn't take part in recording. Instead, Noro and Sakurai recorded a new song in Acoustic Arrangement, called \"Mirage\".\nAfter that, Noro and Sakurai went on a domestic club tour as an acoustic guitar duo, called Pegasus.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Guitar ===\nIssei Noro (1976–2006, 2012–present)\nThe leader of Casiopea. He formed another band during Casiopea's hiatus, known as \"Issei Noro Inspirits\". He has also been part of \"Pegasus\" with fellow ex-Casiopea bassist Tetsuo Sakurai.\n\n\n=== Keyboards ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nHidehiko Koike (1976)\nPlayed with Casiopea in their first small-time gigs, but left the group after Casiopea played in Yamaha's music contest \"EastWest '76\" due to already being active in other bands. He didn't record an album with Casiopea until his appearance in their 20th Anniversary concert in 1999.\nMinoru Mukaiya (1977–2006)\nReplaced Hidehiko Koike, but is considered Casiopea's original keyboardist, since Koike never recorded an album with the band. In 1985, Minoru Mukaiya founded Ongakukan, a company which was originally for recording equipment, but now makes video games (mainly train simulators, such as the titular series Train Simulator). In 1993, A Japanese Macintosh game was released and made by Ongakukan, called \"Touch the Music by Casiopea\". Most likely, the sound director and music sequencer was Minoru Mukaiya himself. He is also the producer of Mukaiya Club and keyboardist for Katsushika Trio, which comprises the 80s Casiopea lineup, excluding Issei Noro.\nKiyomi Otaka (ja) (2012–2024)\nThe first and, as of yet, only female member of Casiopea. Before joining the group, she had been a solo recording artist since 1998. Unlike Mukaiya, she originally started using organs rather than synthesizers, though, she incorporated synths into her setup as a member of Casiopea. \n\n\n=== Bass ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nTetsuo Sakurai (1976–1989)\nCasiopea's original Bassist. He and Akira Jimbo left in 1989 to form the drum/bass duo known as Jimsaku. (The name \"Jimsaku\" is a combination of \"Jimbo and Sakurai\", both members' names.) He would later continue to collaborate with Casiopea and was featured on the band's 20th anniversary album. Sakurai also is one of the halves of acoustic guitar duo Pegasus (along with Issei Noro), mentioned above.\nYoshihiro Naruse  (de, ja) (1977–1979 (as Live Support) and 1980–1989 (in other crossovers); 1990–2006, 2012–present)\nIs known to his fans as \"Narucho\", and is one of the two members (along with organist Kiyomi Otaka) that had an established solo career before joining Casiopea. According to Yamaha's \"Event Archives\", he was one of the judges of EastWest '77. One of his first solo albums, \"Bass Bawl\", features Tetsuo Sakurai on a song called \"Captain Chaos\".\n\n\n=== Drums ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nTohru \"Rika\" Suzuki (1976)\nPlayed during their small-time gigs in Yamaha's \"EastWest '76\" concert. He left afterwards to record with the band Prism (ja) and was replaced by Takashi Sasaki in 1977. However, he would perform with them in crossover shows (likely when the rest of Prism was involved) in 1979, and perform with Noro, Mukaiya and Naruse in a Christmas album called Superman Santa in 1986.\nTakashi Sasaki (ja) (1977–1979)\nReplaced Tohru Suzuki, but is mostly considered the band's original drummer. It is rumored that he left the group because he was used to playing complicated rhythms, and Casiopea's sound was becoming too smooth for his style.\nAkira Jimbo (1980–1989 as official member; 1997–2006 and 2012–2022 as Special Support)\nCasiopea's longest-tenured drummer, who joined in 1980 as a full-time member. In 1989, he and Tetsuo Sakurai left the group to form Jimsaku. He returned in 1997 as a special support dummer. Apart from Casiopea, he also plays drums for Issei Noro's backing band Inspirits and for the Tropical Jazz Big Band. On February 10, 2022, Akira Jimbo announced he would be leaving Casiopea 3rd. His final appearance with Casiopea 3rd was during the April and May 2022 Billboard Tour.\nMasaaki Hiyama (1990–1992)\nJoined the group and replaced Akira Jimbo. He left the band because of medical problems.\nNoriaki Kumagai (ja) (1992–1996)\nReplaced Masaaki Hiyama and played as a Casiopea member until the end of their 1996 autumn tour. In 2004, he formed Jazz-Fusion Supergroup TRIX alongside former T-Square bassist Mitsuru Sutoh, session keyboardist Hiroshi Kubota and session guitarist Takeshi Hirai, with Kubota replaced by Ayaki Saito in 2013 then Keiki Uto in 2022 (the latter as a support member) and Hirai replaced by Yuya Komoguchi in 2011 then Hidehisa Sasaki in 2017 respectively.\nKozo Suganuma (ja) (1996–1997, Support Member) (died November 8, 2021)\nBriefly joined Casiopea between Noriaki Kumagai's departure and Akira Jimbo's return to the band.\nYoshinori Imai (2022–present)\nIt was announced on the band's website that Imai would be replacing Akira Jimbo as the band's drummer. Imai was previously part of UK Rampage.\n\n\n=== Vocals ===\nYukoh Kusunoki (ja) (1986–1987)\nVocalist in Casiopea that joined during their 10th anniversary tour in 1986, appearing in Casiopea Perfect Live II and  Platinum as well, and left after the \"Magical Dancing Tour\" at the end of 1987. He also performed in Issei Noro's band Inspirits.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Original albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Remix albums ===\nCasiopea in the 90s – The Taavi Mote Remix (1991)\nRecall (Cuts U.K. Remix) (1993)\n\n\n=== Self-cover albums ===\nAsian Dreamer (1994)\n\n\n== Compilations ==\nAir Skip (1983)\nThe Soundgraphy (1984)\nLanding to Summer (1986)\nFunky Sound Members (1987)\nTwin Best Vol. 1 (1987)\nTwin Best Vol. 2 (1987)\nThe Last Members (1990)\nCasiopea Best Selection (1990)\nBest of Best (1990)\nMemory (1991)\nAguri Suzuki selected for F1 (1993)\nHearty Notes (1994)\nWork in (1995)\nCasiopea and Jimsaku (1996)\nSuper Best of Casiopea (1996)\nSchedir (1996)\nBest Selection (1999)\n20th Anniversary Best (1999)\nLimited Editional Collectors Box (2001)\nSingle Collection (2001)\nLive and More (2004)\nGolden Best (2004)\nGentle and Mellow (2006)\nPlays Guitar Minus One – Bitter Sweet (2007)\nPlays Guitar Minus One – Inspire (2007)\nPlays Guitar Minus One – Places (2007)\nPlays Guitar Minus One – Marble (2007)\nPlays Guitar Minus One – Signal (2007)\nLegend of Casiopea (2009)\nBest of Casiopea – Alfa Collection (2009)\nLiving on a Feeling – Casiopea Night Selection (2009)\nGolden Best – Pony Canyon Years (2011)\nSuper Best (2011)\nUltimate Best – Early Alfa Years (2012)\nThe Premium Best (2013)\nVestige (2017)\n\n\n== Videography ==\nCasiopea Live (1985)\nCasiopea Perfect Live II (1987)\nJóia (1989)\nThe Party − Visual Stack (1990)\nMotion Pictures from Full Colors (1991)\nMade in Melbourne (1992)\nLive in London 1983 (1992)\nAct-One (1992)\nDetail of Flowers (1996)\n20th (2000)\nAgain (2000)\nLive History Part 1 (2000)\nLive History Part 2 (2000)\nThe Mint Session (2001)\nVintage 2002 (2002)\nCasiopea vs. The Square − The Live (2004)\nThe Way of Casiopea (2004)\n5 Stars Live (2005)\nLive Liftoff 2012 (2012)\nTA・MA・TE・BOX TOUR (2014)\nA・SO・N・DA (2015)\n4010 (2018)\nCelebrate 40th (2020)\nNew Beginning (2023)\n\n\n== Radio ==\nA fan-run internet radio called Nonstop Casiopea, created in 2016, mostly streams Casiopea's music.

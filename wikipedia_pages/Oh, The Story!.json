Oh, The Story! is currently on indefinite hiatus.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOh, The Story! formed after lead vocalist James Larson left the Baltimore-based band, The Late Night, in 2006.\nIn early 2007, the band entered the studio to start work on their first studio album, Good Morning Illumination.  The album was produced and recorded by Paul Leavitt and was released in May 2007.\nOh, The Story! went through several line-up changes from 2007-2009.  In late 2008, James and guitarist JW Sargent went into the studio with former drummer Evan Chapman to record the band's first EP.\nIn April 2009, Oh, The Story! released their second release and first EP, Sea Of Stars.  Production and recording on this record were done by Justin Chapman, former keyboardist for Oh, The Story!.\nAfter the record was finished, James and JW found drummer Chris Pollock, bassist Josh Schlotterback, guitarist John Calvin, and keyboardist Scott Swindells after their previous bands had broken up.  Shortly after the release, the band performed at the Journey's Backyard BBQ held at White Marsh Mall in May 2009.

The album was released in July 2010.  During the summer of 2010, Oh, The Story! performed again on the Ernie Ball Stage at Warped Tour 2010 in Columbia, MD.

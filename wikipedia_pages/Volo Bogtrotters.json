    "text": "The Volo Bogtrotters are an old-time American string band, based in the Chicago area, that played songs and tunes from the string bands of the 1920s and fiddle music from the Midwest, as well as from other new and traditional sources. The band was together from circa 1984 to 2002 and during that period made four recordings on the Marimac Label.

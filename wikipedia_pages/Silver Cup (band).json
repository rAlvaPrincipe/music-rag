Silver Cup began in 2019 with the siblings composing music out of Logan's basement apartment and largely began posting their music online. Logan cited this as an attempt to garner support before performing live. Hadley serves as a vocalist, Campbell served as the bass/guitarist, and Logan serves as a vocalist/guitarist. Brittany Barnes serves as the band's manager. The band 'Silver Cup' was named after a fish food company founded by the sibling's great-grandfather, Sterling Silver Cup Fish Food (Nelson and Sons. Inc).\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Sabbath and Early Career ===\nIn 2019, Silver Cup released their first single \"Sabbath\" on November 3. This song was dedicated to Holladay, Utah, the town the trio group up in. Within the song, they reference \"a bubble-esque community\" and the pressures they felt growing up. The band noted that following the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, they saw a significant increase in viewership at around this time. In February 2020, they released their second single \"You\". Soon after, they released the song \"Night Games\" along with an accompanying music video.

The Daily Utah Chronicle described the EP as:\n\nThe sound is similar to Silver Cup's early singles but still manages to take a refreshing twist on the band's traditional sound.

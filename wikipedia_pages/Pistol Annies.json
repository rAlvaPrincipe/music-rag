The women gave themselves the nicknames \"Lonestar Annie\" (Lambert), \"Hippie Annie\" (Monroe), and \"Holler Annie\" (Presley). They released the album Hell on Heels on August 23, 2011, with the title song being released for purchase on their website two months earlier, on June 12. After a series of performances during Lambert concerts, the Pistol Annies performed three sold-out headlining shows in December 2011 with guest performances by John Fogerty and Blake Shelton.\nThe trio was featured on the track \"Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies\" on the 2012 album Voice of Ages by The Chieftains. The Pistol Annies song \"Run Daddy Run\" appears on the soundtrack album The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond. The band performed their autobiographical single \"Takin' Pills\" at the 2012 CMT Music Awards.\nAnnie Up, the trio's second studio album, was released on May 7, 2013.

The group is also featured on the Blake Shelton single, \"Boys 'Round Here,\" from his 2013 album, Based on a True Story….\nThe group cancelled all tour stops in June 2013, according to their record label, \"due to unforeseen circumstances\".  Lambert still performed as a solo act in June. Monroe went to the Mermaids of Alcatraz Tour with Train. In August 2014, Angaleena Presley confirmed that the group was on temporary hiatus, saying that due to the success of Lambert's and Monroe's solo careers, the band \"just had to take a little break but never say never.\" Whilst promoting their appearances at the 2016 C2C festival, both Miranda Lambert and Ashley Monroe stressed that the Pistol Annies had not disbanded and intended to work together when all three members were available. They also stated their hope to one day do a UK tour.\nIn 2017, the Annies recorded a cover of the song \"Tulsa Time\" which appeared on a Don Williams tribute album titled Gentle Giants: The Songs of Don Williams which was released on May 26.

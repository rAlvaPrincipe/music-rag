    "text": "S.P.O.C.K (aka Star Pilot On Channel K) is a Swedish synthpop band which formed around 1988.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe band's original lineup was songwriter Eddie Bengtsson (formerly a founding member of Page), Finn Albertsson, and vocalist Alexander Hofman. Over time the members of the band have shifted: Johan Billing was a member of the band from 1994 to 1998, but with the release of S.P.O.C.K: 1999 (in 1999) the band's lineup changed to one with Alexander Hofman (the band's only remaining founding member), Johan Malmgren (former member of Elegant Machinery and Aaron Sutcliffe) and Christer Hermodsson.\nIn 1988, Eddie Bengtsson wrote a handful of songs to be performed at Finn Albertsson's birthday party, with Alexander Hofman performing vocals; the three young men dubbed the band Mr. Spock (after the name for the character Spock of Star Trek). After the performance at the party, the band continued for several months to play at other house parties, but soon managed to secure some event bookings. In 1989, the band members contacted Paramount Pictures for permission to use the name \"Mr. Spock\". When Paramount demanded a heavy compensation for the privilege, the band renamed themselves using the initials S.P.O.C.K, which are an acronym for Star Pilot On Channel K.\nS.P.O.C.K's commercial success began in 1990 when the Swedish record label Accelerating Blue Fish published \"Silicon Dream\" as a limited-edition 7-inch single. The lyrical subject matter of S.P.O.C.K's songs frequently centers on science fiction stories, (in particular, Star Trek). Other topics include alien-human relations and life in space. Representative songs include: \"Alien Attack\", \"E.T. Phone Home\", \"Never Trust a Klingon\", \"Not Human\", \"In Space No One Can Hear You Scream\", \"Mr. Spock's Brain\", \"Dr. McCoy\" and \"Astrogirl\".\nOn stage the band members adopted a cyberpunk/sci-fi-esque personae, with Eddie Bengtsson calling himself \"Eddie B. Kirk\", Alexander Hofman as \"Android\", and Finn Albertsson as \"Cybernoid\". Together with such bands as Page, Elegant Machinery, Sista Mannen På Jorden and Kiethevez, S.P.O.C.K helped to define the sound of the Swedish synthpop movement.\nIn 1997, members of S.P.O.C.K started their own recording label SubSpace Communications. The band's 1999 album, 1999, ranked #25 on the German Alternative Chart's (DAC) 1999 Top 50 Albums chart.\nIn 2010 Christer Hermodsson left the band in order to focus on other musical endeavors. He was then replaced by Valdi Solemo. The band's current line up is vocalist Alexander Hofman (a.k.a. Android - the only remaining founding member), keyboardist Valdi Solemo (aka Val Solo), and keyboardist Johan Malmgren (aka Yo-Haan).\nDuring the last years S.P.O.C.K has focused more on live gigs. Mostly in Germany, but also in Sweden, Canada, Estonia, Mexico, United Kingdom & the Czech Republic.\nJohan Malmgren and Eskil Simonsson of the band Covenant formed the band Aaron Sutcliffe in 1999 to perform synthpop covers of Elvis Presley songs.\n\n\tS.P.O.C.K, current line-up live at Wave-Gotik-Treffen 2017, Leipzig\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nFive Year Mission – CD (1993) Energy Rekords\nAlien Worlds – CD (1995) Energy Rekords\nAssignment: Earth – CD (1997) SubSpace Communications/VISION Records/TCM Musikproduktionsgesellschaft mbH • CD (1998) SubSpace Communications – #16 CMJ RPM Charts (U.S.)\nS.P.O.C.K: 1999 – CD (1999) SubSpace Communications/VISION Records – #29 CMJ RPM Charts (U.S.); #25 DAC (Germany)\n2001: A S.P.O.C.K Odyssey – CD (2001) Bloodline/SubSpace Communications\n\n\n=== Compilation Albums ===\nA Piece of the Action – 2xCD Ltd.

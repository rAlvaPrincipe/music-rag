    "text": "Young Wonder were an Irish electro-pop duo from Cork.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIan Ring is from Ballintemple and Rachel Koeman is from Watergrasshill, with a Dutch father. They met in 2012, and played at Castlepalooza in that year, and at the 2013 Latitude Festival. Their debut album, Birth, was nominated for the Choice Music Prize; The Irish Times called it \"evocative and powerful, a run of songs that glisten from both slick studio shaping and some strong, deft hooks.\" By 2019 the duo had separated, with Ring making music under the name \"Boku.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nIan Ring (producer)\nRachel Koeman (vocals)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nEPs\nYoung Wonder (2012)\nShow Your Teeth (2013)\nAlbums\nBirth (2015)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYoung Wonder on Twitter"

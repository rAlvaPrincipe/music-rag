The group signed under GMA's Artist Center and its label GMA Records after winning the competition in 2015. The group released their debut album digitally on April 28, 2016 with their carrier single, \"Pag-gising\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2015: To the Top ===\n\nIn 2015, GMA Network created To the Top, the Philippines' first  multi-platform boy band competition. The competition invited talented male singers from different school organizations nationwide to form the newest boy band sensation. Eighteen contestants went through rigorous training in singing and dancing under The CompanY's Moy Ortiz, Sweet Plantado and OJ Mariano; Sonic State Audio writers and producers Chino David, Brian Lotho, Tony V and Jon Ong; Madelle and Prince Paltu-ob, and Jesse \"Reflex\" Gotangco of Philippine All Stars; and the Maestro Ryan Cayabyab.\nIn the series' finale, Adrian Pascual, Joshua Jacobe, Louie Pedroso, Mico Cruz, and Miko Manguba were named the grand winners and formed Top One Project. Prior to joining the contest, Manguba, Pedroso and Cruz, are veteran performers in their school glee clubs. Magbanua serves as the leader of the group.\n\n\n=== 2016: Debut album and concert ===\nTop One Project's debut album, T.O.P., was released digitally on April 28, 2016, available on Spotify and iTunes. Under GMA Records, T.O.P. had the chance to re-record five of the most popular songs from To the Top and an original song for the album. It features six tracks: \"Bakit Ganon\", \"Somebody\", \"Kaya Ko, Kaya Mo\", \"Alaala\", their original composition, \"San Na\", and carrier single, \"Paggising\". Most of these songs are written by known musicians in the OPM industry such as Chino David from Silent Sanctuary and Brian Lotho who are both under Sonic State Audio. \"San Na\" was an experimental track as the group challenges their skills in writing and music production.

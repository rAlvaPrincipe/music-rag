    "text": "The discography of Canadian folk rock/alternative rock band Crash Test Dummies consists of eight primary studio albums, 23 singles, one live album, a greatest hits compilation, and two video releases. This list does not include material recorded by band members individually or with other side projects.\nCrash Test Dummies is most identifiable through Brad Roberts' distinctive bass-baritone voice, and the backing/occasional lead vocals of Ellen Reid. During its heyday, the band consisted of Roberts, Ellen Reid (co-vocals, keyboards), Brad's brother Dan Roberts (bass guitar), Benjamin Darvill (harmonica, mandolin), and Mitch Dorge (drums, percussion). Today, only Brad Roberts and Ellen Reid have appeared on every album, while Dan Roberts still occasionally tours with the band.  Mitch Dorge has been busy working with Tuesday's Girl and Charlie Redstar, along with his own projects since 2002. Benjamin Darvill has been busy with his solo project Son of Dave since 2000 and is unlikely to play with the band again, since he now lives in London.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Pre-label releases ===\nThe band released two demo tapes.

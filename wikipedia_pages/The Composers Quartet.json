Carter's Fourth Quartet was dedicated to the Composers Quartet, who premiered the work in 1986.  The group has performed quartets by more than 60 American composers, and has toured abroad extensively.\nThe quartet was founded in 1965, and remained active until the late 1990s.  During the early 1970s it was the quartet-in-residence at New England Conservatory, where it sponsored a biennial composition prize.  In 1975, the group became the quartet-in-residence at Columbia University, remaining at Columbia for at least two decades.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMatthew Raimondi (d. 2024), violin\nAnahid Ajemian, violin\nBernard Zaslav, viola (succeeded by Jean Dupouy, Jean Dane, and Ron Carbone; the quartet also recorded with violist Maureen Gallagher)\nSeymour Barab, cello (succeeded by Michael Rudiakov, Michael Haber and Mark Shuman)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Composers Quartet discography at Discogs"

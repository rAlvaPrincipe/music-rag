    "text": "Arcana is Swedish neoclassical dark wave band created in 1994 by Peter Bjärgö.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original band consisted of founder Peter Bjärgö (then Peter Pettersson) and vocalist Ida Bengtsson. Since 2002, Arcana has changed line-up and now consists of Peter Bjärgö, Stefan Eriksson, Ann-Mari Thim, Ia Bjärgö and Mattias Borgh.\nOften largely instrumental, the band describes its music as inspired by medieval music or the middle age's more romantic aspects. Their album Le Serpent Rouge had a more oriental feeling to it, with instruments like hammered dulcimer, finger cymbals, duduk and other oriental/Arabic instruments. Since 2006, Arcana is signed to Kalinkaland Records in Germany.\nPeter also has a martial industrial side-project called Sophia and has also recorded one collaborative album with Gustaf Hildebrand.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nTheir first album Dark Age of Reason, released on Cold Meat Industry, has been compared to the early works by Dead Can Dance.\nThe third album ...The Last Embrace was published in 2000. It introduced the acoustic guitar and real percussion instruments to Arcana's repertoire.\nThe sixth album Le Serpent Rouge was released in 2004 on Erebus Odor Records. It features orientally inspired music and a stronger integration of acoustic instruments than previously.\n2008 saw the release of \"Raspail\" on Kalinkaland Records. Arcana's earlier Neo-classical and medieval style returned with this album.\n\n\n=== As Arcana ===\n\n\n=== As Bjärgö/Hildebrand ===\n\n\n== In other media ==\nThe remake of the Dead Can Dance song \"Enigma of the Absolute\" was used in the soundtrack for the popular Civilization 4 mod Fall from Heaven 2 as background music for the Runes Of Kilmorph religion.\nThe composition \"Wings of Gabriel\" was used in the soundtrack for the popular Medieval 2: Total War mod Broken Crescent as a main theme.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nArcana discography at MusicBrainz\nArcana discography at Discogs"

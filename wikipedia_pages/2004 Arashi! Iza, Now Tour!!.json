The main stage consist of a large half globe structure that opens up for Arashi's entrance to new songs or different sets while huge LED screens displayed close-ups of the performances or graphics as added effect. The small adjoining walkway were constructed of inflatable material that made them bounce while walking on it. There was also a concave walkway that was at eye level with a part of the arena area audience. Raising platforms and cranes were also used so that the Arashi members will be able to get closer to the audience on the second floor.\nVariety of themes can be observed for different parts of the set list. The first set of performance (Overture, Jam, Gori Muchuu, Pikanchi and Pikanchi Double) were presented in futuristic themed wardrobes in addition with use of pyrotechnics and lights. The setting changed dramatically to an African safari like set for Horizon, accompanied by an army of camouflaged Johnny's Junior (back up dancers). The songs for this set (Horizon, Dangan-Liner and Nemuranai Karada) were remixed in accordance with the African theme.\nPerformance of Lucky Man right to Eyes With Delight was done in a laid back manner. Eyes With Delight was recorded in multiple angles focusing on each member plus one edited shots of all of them together.\nStrumming of a Spanish guitar commenced the beginning of a new rendition of Tomadoi Nagara in a slower beat and acoustic Spanish influenced sound. The beautiful ballad was performed with images of Spain reflected on the screen in the background. Kimi Wa Sukoshimo Warukunai which was a pure pop song was upgraded with flamenco beat resulting to a fresh new arrangement. Arashi who were dressed in dark magenta suits with lace finishing, danced the flamenco while the fangirls screamed in approval.\nAfter the solos by Ninomiya and Matsujun, Arashi performed a rock remixed version of their hit song \"A Day in Our Life\". An energetic dance performance of \"RIGHT BACK TO YOU\" follows. The dance was performed on an elevated stage. The set of songs after that consist of happy songs setting the mood before they bid their farewells.\n\n\n== External links ==\nProduct information\n\n\n== References =="

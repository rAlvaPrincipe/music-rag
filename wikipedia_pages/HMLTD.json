    "text": "HMLTD are a British art punk band from London, formed in 2015. The band currently consists of lead vocalist Henry Spychalski, guitarist Duc Peterman, bassist Nico Mohnblatt, drummer Achilleas Sarantaris and keyboardist Seth Evans. On 7 February 2020, they released their debut album, West of Eden. On 7 April 2023, they released their second album, The Worm.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHMLTD was formed in London as Happy Meal Ltd. in early 2015.  Singer Henry Spychalski was born and raised in Torquay before moving to London. Spychalski met Duc, who had played in a band with Nico in Paris, at a bar in London, which helped foster a friendship and the formation of the band. James originates from Ipswich and shared a house in Elephant and Castle with friends, including Henry.  Zac, from Bristol, met Duc through Reddit and \"less vile corners\" of 4chan, and Vincent from Hong Kong; when he returned home in late 2015, he was replaced by Achilleas, originally from Athens. Late in 2019, Zac left the band to focus on his education. He was replaced by Seth Evans, a friend of the band who they met in London.\nHMLTD has been criticised for using queer and/or gender-bender aesthetics as heterosexual men, including cross-dressing, make-up, and flamboyant performances. According to Spychalski, the band is \"trying to challenge toxic masculinity, and we’re doing that from the perspective we can do that from, as the human beings we were born into being, which is predominantly straight cis men. But I don’t think having that role should exclude or prohibit you from taking on that political perspective and from taking on what is probably the most violent, toxic, cruel force in our society. We learn from queer methods and always try to express that indebtedness.\"\nTheir image and sound can be seen as influenced by the Ziggy Stardust era of David Bowie and the New Romantic period in the 1980s. Their sound has been compared to various acts, such as The Prodigy and Peaches. They have also been regarded as avant-garde for their infusion of EDM and experimental pop with their guitar-oriented sound.\nOn 20 July 2018, HMLTD released their debut EP, Hate Music Last Time Delete.\nOn 7 February 2020, HMLTD released their debut studio album West of Eden.\nOn 7 April 2023, HMLTD released their second album, The Worm.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\n\nHenry Spychalski – vocals (2015–present)\nDuc Peterman – guitar (2015–present)\nNicolas Mohnblatt – bass, keyboards (2015–present)\nAchilleas Sarantaris – drums (2015–present)\nSeth Evans – keyboards – (2021–present)\nFormer members\n\nZacharie Cazes – keyboards (2015–2019)\nJames Donovan – guitar (2015–2022)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nWest of Eden (2020)\nThe Worm (2023)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nHate Music Last Time Delete (2018)\nDon't Leave Me (2021)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Stained\" / \"Is This What You Wanted?\" (2016)\n\"To The Door\" / \"Music!\" (2017)\n\"Satan, Luella & I\" / \"Kinkakuji\" (2017)\n\"Death Drive\" (2018)\n\"Flex\" (feat.

    "text": "Tika & the Dissidents is an Indonesian band whose music includes elements from jazz, blues, tango, waltz to punk.\n\n\n== History ==\nJakarta-born singer Kartika Jahja first released her own solo albums titled Frozen Love Songs (2005) and Defrosted Love Songs (2006) under Aksara Records. She then recruited Luky Annash (piano), Susan Agiwitanto (bass), Okky Rahman Oktavian (drums), and Panji Gustiano (guitar) to be her backup band. Along the way, the band became a significant part of the song-writing process.\nIn 2009, they first declared themselves as Tika and the Dissidents in the original soundtrack album of Joko Anwar’s film Pintu Terlarang. In the same year, the band parted ways with guitar player Panji Gustiano. A few months later they welcomed Iga Massardi as the newest member of the Dissidents.\nAfter a two-year recording process, Tika and the Dissidents’ full-length album the Headless Songstress was released in July 2009 under the Head Records, a record label owned by the band. \nMuch to the band's surprise, the Headless Songstress received numerous praises from music fans and the media, both national and international. Tika and the Dissidents is said to be a breath of fresh air in the country's homogenous music industry. The pinnacle of the year was when TEMPO magazine awarded the album as \"Album of the Year 2009\" and the band as \"2009’s Chosen Music Figure\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThe Headless Songstress (2009)\n\n\n=== Soundtracks ===\nPintu Terlarang – “Home Safe” (Original Soundtrack – Lifelike Records, 2009)\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nKartika Jahja - Vocals\nSusan Agiwitanto - Bass\nIga Massardi - Guitar\nJonathan Palempung - Keyboard\nHertri Nur Pamungkas - Drums\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Indonesian musicians\n\n\n== References ==\n\nLose your head with Tika and The Dissidents .Jakarta Post. 2009-07-25.Tika and The Dissidents Melepas Bidadari Tanpa Kepala .Rolling Stone Indonesia. 2009-07-30.Tika & The Dissidents Angkat Pol Pot ke Lagu .Kompas. 2009-07-30.Singer Loses Her Head For Music .Jakarta Globe. 2009-08-19.Burn, Baby, Burn .Time Magazine Asia. 2005-11-30.Lima Album Indonesia Terbaik 2009 .Jakartabeat.net. 2009-12-19.\n\n\n== External links ==\nSuaratika\nTIKA and The Dissidents Myspace\nJournal TIKA and The Disidents"

    "text": "Zeb and Haniya (Pashto: زیب اور حانیا, pronounced as \"Zayb aur Haa-nee-ya\") was a Pakistani music duo from Kohat, active from 2007 to 2014. The pair have sung songs in Pashto, Urdu, Dari and Turkish, combining pop with folk music to create a diverse body of work. Their music has been described as alternative, art folk, ethnic blues and easy listening by international reviewers and critics.\nThe band was a project started by two cousins, Zebunnisa Bangash and Haniya Aslam, both of whom are ethnic Pashtuns. Brought up with music, they began writing together when studying as undergraduates at Smith College and Mount Holyoke College in the United States.\nWhile their family is originally from Kohat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, much of the band's work took place in Islamabad and Lahore. Touring in 2009, they have performed mostly in Dubai, and in some parts of Sindh and Punjab.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation (2000–2007) ===\nZebunnisa Humayun Bangash has been singing since age eight and has been training as a vocalist since 1998 with acclaimed Ustad Mubarak Ali Khan. Her fellow musician and first cousin, Haniya Aslam, was a guitarist, vocalist and songwriter. Zeb and Haniya was conceived while the pair attended college in the United States; Zeb studied Economics and History of Art and Haniya studied Computer Science and Anthropology. Chup, their first song, came to life in sessions at an abandoned café in the basement of Zeb's dorm. After response from the college community, Zeb and Haniya recorded a rough version of Chup and another song titled Yaad with Mekaal Hasan (of Mekaal Hasan Band). They spread via the internet and soon found their way onto Pakistan's City FM 89 radio waves.\nAfter the success of Chup and Yaad, Zeb and Haniya began performing live. The first was commissioned by the American Consulate in Islamabad, followed by their first full-length concert in Lahore.\n\n\n=== Chup!

Mauj's Omran Shafique contributes blues lead guitar on one song, and Co-Ven's Hamza Jafri, Sikander Mufti and Sameer Ahmed feature on the album's closing number, a high-spirited fusion track. The Norwegian jazz trumpeter, Hildegunn Øiseth, makes an appearance in five tracks.\nIn addition to recording the album and shooting for videos, 2007 and 2008 were marked by a multitude of appearances on Pakistani television networks, including Geo, Dawn, Aaj, CNBC. After the album launch, Zeb and Haniya toured Pakistan, promoting their album with live shows and media appearances.

Their debut album received positive reviews in most of Pakistan's major newspapers, and they were hailed as one of the (if not the) first all-female bands from Pakistan.\n\n\n=== Coke Studio (2009–2010) ===\nIn 2009, they performed \"Paimona\", \"Chup\" and \"Chal Diye\" at Coke Studio Sessions along with the artists Javed Bashir, Noori, Atif Aslam, Ali Zafar, and Strings.

The duo concluded regardless of the country situation they are fully focused on their work and are working on releasing an album. \"It is relevant to us, this is the world that we are living in, this is the situation that we are surrounded by and we are responding in someway or the other. This song we just wanted it to be a lovely pleasant song that makes you smile and makes you feel good\", said Haniya Aslam.  Zebunnisa Bangash added \"Despite everything, there are beautiful things happening in this country, there are moments of happiness, there's happiness all around, so we thought it might actually be nice to bring that together into a song\".\nOn 11 May, in an interview with the newspaper The Express Tribune, Zeb and Haniya confirmed that they would be releasing a seven track extended-play, The Happy Song, in fall through the record label True Brew Records. Bangash said:  \"We are feeling a bit more confident, so we are taking a few experimental steps here and there, kind of pushing our envelope a little bit\", and in regard to the album said \"It's going to be a collaborative effort, and several known as well as lesser known people will be involved. Aslam added: \"It's going to be exciting because the writings are being done without the aim of releasing an album, so the spirit in which things are being done has excited us\". The band stated that they were looking forward to making a career in India; Bangash said \"India has a huge classical music tradition, which is one of my passions\".\nBangash contributed to \"Sooha Saha\" for A.R.

He was born and raised in Derry City in Northern Ireland and moved to Dublin for university in 1968. He was a member of such ground-breaking groups as Skara Brae and Altan, before joining Fingal.\nJames Keane is recognized as one of the masters of the Irish accordion. Castagnari issued a signature instrument to honor his achievements in Irish music and on the two row button accordion.\nRandal Bays is among the few Americans who play Irish fiddle to gain serious respect for his music in Ireland. His 2005 release, “House to House” (with Roger Landes) was selected by the Irish Times as one of the top five traditional recordings of the year, and the Cork Examiner called him \"a rare beast, a master of both the fiddle and the guitar.”\n\n\n== Discography ==\nFingal (2008)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nIrish Times\nFingal Independent\nIr-Trad\nThe Olympian on-line Archived 10 May 2008 at the Wayback Machine\nIrish Philadelphia\n\n\n== External links ==\nFingal's website\nRandal Bay's website\nJames Keane's website Archived 11 March 2009 at the Wayback Machine\nDáithí Sproule's website"

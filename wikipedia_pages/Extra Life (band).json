    "text": "Extra Life is an American experimental band from Brooklyn, New York. Extra Life is known for their unusual rhythms and time signatures and for frontman and composer Charlie Looker's unique singing style, which often uses melisma and is inspired by Medieval and Renaissance music.\n\n\n== History and career ==\nExtra Life was initially a project name for Charlie Looker (previously of Zs, Dirty Projectors) and any accompanying artists. Looker composed all of the music for Extra Life's 2008 debut Secular Works,  which featured Looker alongside drummer Ian Antonio, violist Karen Waltuch, and bassist Tony Gedrich. Looker composed most parts on 2010's Made Flesh and 2011's Ripped Heart EP, but the recordings included more collaborative work; by 2012's Dream Seeds, Extra Life had become a trio project, with Caley Monahon-Ward and Nick Podgurski contributing to arrangements and writing their own parts.\nExtra Life became known for straddling genres, regularly collaborating live with avant-garde jazz saxophonist Travis Laplante, having songs remixed by Xiu Xiu, and playing alongside bands like black metal project Liturgy. Their second album, Made Flesh, was named one of the best albums of 2010 by The Quietus. \nOn November 13, 2012, Extra Life officially disbanded, with a statement saying \"the inner creative momentum driving the band has stalled.\"\nThe band reunited in 2022 to self-release the album Secular Works Vol. 2, featuring a lineup consisting of Looker on voice and guitars, Monahon-Ward on violin and viola, Toby Driver of Kayo Dot on electric bass, and Gil Chevign√© on drums and percussion.\nIn 2024, Extra Life announced their fifth full-length, The Sacred Vowel, with Looker and Driver joined by drummer David Bodie and Timba Harris on violin and viola.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums & EPs ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAllmusic biography: Extra Life\nInterview with Charlie Looker in Impose Magazine\n\"Band to watch: Extra Life\" on Stereogum"

    "text": "The Wilten Boys' Choir (German: Wiltener SÃ¤ngerknaben) is a part of the Premonstratensian Wilten Abbey, at the foot of Bergisel in Innsbruck, Austria. Founded in the mid-13th century, it is one of the oldest boys' choirs in Europe.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe choir shares a common history with the Vienna Boys' Choir. According to contemporary sources, Emperor Maximilian I in 1498 established a court orchestra at Hofburg Palace in Vienna, including a choir which largely consisted of boys descending from Wilten in the County of Tyrol.\nIn 1946, the Wilten Boys' Choir was reestablished by Norbert Gerhold.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe choir currently consists of about 150 members, the youngest of which are about 6 years old. Following the change of voice, the boys can join the male voices and stay in the choir. The \"concert choir\" of the Wilten Boys' Choir is a special division of the Tiroler Landeskonservatorium.\nSince 1991, Johannes Stecher is the choir's artistic director. Martin Pleyer and Vinzenz Arnold are in charge of organizational matters.\n\n\n== Repertoire ==\nThe choir's repertoire includes a wide range, from sacred music to traditional alpine folk songs and opera.\nDuring many concert tours, they have performed in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, France, Great Britain, Denmark, Romania, Israel and Japan.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

    "text": "Midori (ミドリ) was a four-member rock band formed in 2003 in Osaka, Japan featuring Mariko Gotō on vocals and guitar, Yoshitaka Kozeni on drums, Keigo Iwami on bass, and Hajime on keyboard.\nGotō often wore a school uniform while performing, and would climb speakers and crowd surf. The band initially formed to play covers of kayōkyoku, but decided they weren't talented enough, and began to write their own songs. As they developed their influences included Italian prog, Kodō, J-Rock band Judy & Mary and Janis Joplin.\nTheir disbandment was publicly announced by Gotō on December 25, 2010, with their last show titled \"Sayonara, Gotō-san\" being played on December 28.\nAs a band, Midori released three albums, three extended plays, and two demos.\n\n\n== Style and Songwriting ==\nMidori's musical style is characterized by the distinctive vocal delivery of lead singer Mariko Goto, which encompasses a range from melodic singing to intense screaming. Following 2008, Goto's vocal approach shifted towards more melodic expressions, a change she attributes to gaining confidence in her singing abilities. A significant alteration in the band's instrumental lineup occurred post-2004 with the introduction of Hajimetal, leading to the replacement of a second electric guitar with a piano. \nAccording to Midori themselves, their sound, which integrates elements of Art Punk, Progressive Hardcore, Post-hardcore, and Jazz Rock, reflects the diverse musical backgrounds of its members.\nMariko Goto is the primary lyricist for Midori, and she describes her approach to writing as spontaneous, without adherence to any predetermined structure. This method, however, led to some reflection during the creation of \"shinsekai.\" Goto expressed regret over this spontaneous approach, feeling it catered more to the expectations of Midori's fanbase rather than fulfilling her own artistic intentions.\n\n\n== Collaborators ==\nMidori released their last two albums under Sony Entertainment after a disagreement with their previous label.\n\n\n== Live Performances ==\nMidori's live performances were renowned for their intense energy, a hallmark of which was lead singer Mariko Goto's choice of attire and her interaction with the audience, which included shouting obscenities and, on occasion, removing her outfit to throw it into the crowd. \nKeyboardist Hajimetal has linked these dynamic performances to the \"explosive power\" inherent in their music. Drummer Kozeni has commented on the band's preference for analog recording techniques, suggesting that the unrefined quality of such recordings better captures the essence of Midori's sound. Goto herself has described the band's live shows as a collaborative creation between Midori and their audience, emphasizing the raw, unfiltered exchange of energy that defines their concerts.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nOfficial line-up\n\n後藤まりこ (Mariko Gotō) - lead vocals, guitar (2003–2010)\nハジメ (Hajime) - keyboards (2004–2010)\n小銭喜剛 (Yoshitaka Kozeni) - drums (2003–2010)\n岩見のとっつあん (Keigo Iwami) - stand up bass (2008–2010)\nFormer members\n\n桑野嘉文 (Kuwano Yoshifumi) - bass (2003)\n井尾良太 (Io Ryota) - guitar (2003–2004)\n劔樹人 (Tsurugi Jujin) - bass (2003–2004)\n矢野雅俊 (Yano Masatoshi) - vocals (2004)\n博智 (Hirochi) - samples (2003–2005)\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Demos ===\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\n初体験 (Initial Experience) (October 7, 2009; recorded June 6, 2009) AIBL-9179\nさよなら、後藤さん。 (Goodbye, Gotō-san) (April 6, 2011; recorded December 30, 2010) AIBL-9213 (limited edition: AIBL-9211)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Swing\" (March 18, 2009) AICL-2003 (Bonus DVD Edition: AICL-2004)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMidori official MySpace"

    "text": "The Similou were an electronic music duo from Gothenburg, Sweden, comprising Dizzy Crane (Joel Eriksson) and Jesse Nectar (Erik Niklasson).\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Internet meme ==\n\"All This Love\" is the base of an Internet meme, particularly on the website YTMND. On 16 July 2006, YTMND user Salta created a site called \"Rainbow Stalin;\" which comes from a misinterpretation of the words \"rainbow stylin'\" in The Similou's song to be about Joseph Stalin. This site featured an edited Soviet propaganda picture to which Salta added a rainbow and gave Stalin cartoon-like eyes. Many of the sites have Soviet propaganda art edited with flashing colors and accessories such as sunglasses, headphones, and turntables to portray Stalin as a jubilant DJ. While the meme comes from YTMND, references can be found on other websites such as YouTube.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArtist page on DNM"

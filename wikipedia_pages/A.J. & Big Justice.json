    "text": "Andrew \"A.J.\" Befumo Jr. (born January 16, 1976) and Eric Justice Befumo (born April 8, 2012), known online as A.J. & Big Justice and as the Costco Guys, are American social media personalities based in Boca Raton, Florida. A father-and-son duo, they found popularity on TikTok and YouTube in 2024 for their videos at the warehouse store Costco. Also that year, they gained more than two million followers on TikTok, signed with the management company Night, and released their debut single \"We Bring the Boom\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nAndrew \"A.J.\" Befumo, who is of Italian descent, previously worked as a professional wrestler for independent promotions around New Jersey, under the name \"the American Powerchild Eric Justice\", starting when he was in college and throughout the 1990s until 2005. His son, Eric, was named after his wrestling persona and born in 2012. He also has a daughter, Ashley. He created a family vlogging YouTube channel, All Befumo'd Up!, when Eric was three years old. He and his family eventually moved from Colts Neck, New Jersey, to Boca Raton, Florida.\nA.J. created a TikTok account in 2022 while working as the regional manager for a mortgage business, portraying the character of Mortgage Muscles, who would explain the housing market. His videos started to gain popularity after he began including his son, Eric, in them at his request. Their first video together, filmed in December 2022, showed Eric introducing A.J. eating a hamburger. Their first video to go viral on the platform was of them shopping for meatballs for Eric's mother, Erika, at the warehouse store Costco, which was posted in January 2024. In March of that year, they posted a video describing themselves as \"Costco Guys\", which, by July, had received over 47 million views. They subsequently began making videos of themselves rating products therein, either positively as a \"boom\" or negatively as a \"doom\".\nIn May 2024, they signed with the talent management company Night and became full-time content creators, by which point they had also become popular on other social media platforms like Snapchat and the video-sharing service Cameo. Erika and Ashley, as well as child social media personality Christian Joseph, known online as The Rizzler, began making appearances in their videos by June 2024. Also by that month, they had more than one million followers on TikTok and were the subjects of various popular memes online. They released a hip hop single, \"We Bring the Boom\", in July 2024, with lyrics based on their TikTok videos. The song found success online, leading to the duo releasing several remixes, including one featuring the Rizzler. Stereogum's Tom Breihan wrote of the song that it \"sounds like a version of joke-rap as recorded by someone who hasn't heard any actual rap since like 1987\" and that it was \"pretty fun\".\nJoe Tilleli of Gizmodo wrote of A.J. & Big Justice in August of that year, \"If you've opened TikTok, Instagram, or X (formerly Twitter) even once this year, you probably know what a Costco Guy is.\" The duo appeared alongside the Rizzler on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon; host Jimmy Fallon was criticized for his perceived lack of enthusiasm throughout the interview. By then, they had accrued over two million followers on TikTok. The duo were also parodied in a TikTok-focused sketch on Saturday Night Live, with A.J. & Big Justice being portrayed by Marcello Hernandez and Chloe Fineman, respectively. \nIn October 2024, A.J. announced that he would wrestle Q. T. Marshall on the pre-show of All Elite Wrestling's Full Gear, accompanied by Big Justice, on November 18. On the final episode of AEW Dynamite before Full Gear, Big Justice announced that the Rizzler would act as the guest timekeeper for the match. On November 23 at Full Gear, A.J. defeated Marshall.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

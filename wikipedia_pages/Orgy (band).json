    "text": "Orgy is an American industrial rock band formed in 1997, from Los Angeles, California. They have described their music as \"death pop\". The band is best known for their cover version of the New Order song \"Blue Monday\", and the song \"Stitches\", both from their 1998 album Candyass. Then they released their second album, Vapor Transmission, which was released in 2000, with \"Fiction (Dreams in Digital)\" and \"Opticon\" as singles.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1997) ===\nOrgy was formed in 1997 by vocalist Jay Gordon and guitarists Amir Derakh and Ryan Shuck. Bassist Paige Haley and drummer Bobby Hewitt soon completed the line-up. Derakh had previously gained some fame in the 1980s metal band Rough Cutt, and Hewitt was a former member of Electric Love Hogs. Gordon played bass in Deadsy due to the lack of a bass player, on their unreleased self-tilted album, splitting roles with his friend and the lead singer, Elijah Blue Allman. He then left Deadsy, to form Orgy. Gordon and Derakh were also experienced producers, having produced Coal Chamber's self-titled album.\nIn 1997, Jonathan Davis, who performed with Shuck in Sexart, signed Orgy as the first act on Korn's label, Elementree Records, which at the time had distribution with Reprise Records.\n\n\n=== Candyass and Vapor Transmission (1998–2001) ===\nIn 1998, Orgy released their debut album, Candyass, the name inspired by a drag queen they had met. The album sold almost two million copies and produced two singles: a cover of the New Order song \"Blue Monday\", and \"Stitches\". Both charted on Total Request Live. The song \"Revival\" featured Jonathan Davis.\nOrgy made their live debut at EdgeFest, an annual radio show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1998. They also appeared on the Family Values Tour with Korn, Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, Incubus, and Rammstein. They were featured on the live compilation album of the tour, released in 1999.  Other tours with Love and Rockets and Sugar Ray followed.\nTheir second album, the science fiction-themed Vapor Transmission, was released in 2000, with \"Fiction (Dreams in Digital)\" and \"Opticon\" as singles.\n\n\n=== Side work and Punk Statik Paranoia (2001–2005) ===\nIn 2001, Orgy released the song \"Faces\" for the soundtrack of the film Zoolander. The band was a musical guest in the television series Charmed, performing \"Opticon\" in the episode \"Sin Francisco\".\nIn late 2003, guitarists Shuck and Derakh formed a side project, Julien-K, as an outlet for electronic material they had come up with during the writing process for Orgy. Jay Gordon also remixed the Linkin Park track \"Points of Authority\" for their album Reanimation, where it was renamed \"Pts.of.Athrty\".\n\nAfter touring in support of Vapor Transmission, Orgy began working on a new album and a live DVD in mid to late 2002, but both of these were pushed back to mid 2003. Eventually, the band left Reprise Records and Elementree, taking the band's already recorded material with them. Explaining the split from the label in an interview to PopGurls.com:\"We just couldn't get it together with them to get the record going and they weren't dropping us. So we finally managed to get let out of our contract and got the stuff that we had already recorded.\" -Amir Derakh  in 2003, Jay Gordon and his father, Lou, started his own independent record label, D1 Music, and the label finally released the band's third album, Punk Statik Paranoia, in February 2004. The long-awaited live DVD, Trans Global Spectacle, was released in August 2005.\nFollowing touring in support of Punk Statik Paranoia, the band went on hiatus in late 2005.\n\n\n=== Hiatus (2005–2012) ===\nWhen asked for an Orgy update in late July 2008, Shuck informed fans that Orgy's return is still underway but their priority is getting the much delayed Julien-K album released. During a video interview at the NAMM Show in 2009, Derakh mentioned a 2010 Orgy reunion.\nShuck and Derakh released their first album as Julien-K, titled Death to Analog, in March 2009. In the same year, they also released an album with Chester Bennington of Linkin Park under the name Dead by Sunrise.\nOn October 25, 2010, Ryan Shuck and Amir Derakh stated on the Julien-K blog: \"As of Oct. 26th we will no longer be part of Orgy. Jay will continue making music without the original members.\"\nOn October 30, 2010, Jay Gordon released a statement via his official Facebook profile stating that he still owns the Orgy name and wants to continue forth creating new material for the band. Gordon wrote that all previous members of the band were too busy with numerous side projects to continue with the original band. \"Everyone has been so busy with their different projects I figured this was the only way for me to continue on with the name. I started this band, and I don't want to let it fall to the wayside completely.\"\nOn November 7, 2011, Blabbermouth.net published a news story detailing the bitter feud between Gordon and guitarists Shuck and Derakh, that had spiraled out of control after Gordon revealed his plans to assemble a band of musicians and begin touring under the name Orgy.\n\n\n=== Return with new lineup (2012–present) ===\nOn February 3, 2012, it was announced that Orgy would embark on a five-week run titled the Bad Blood Tour. Gordon was the only original member of Orgy appearing on this tour.\nOn August 4, 2012, Orgy linked to a 30-second demo of a new song, \"Grime of the Century\", via their Twitter and Facebook page. The song \"Grime of the Century\" was later made available on iTunes and the new Orgy website.\nIn 2013, Orgy embarked on the Wide Awake and Dead Tour with Vampires Everywhere! and Davey Suicide.\nOrgy launched a crowdfunding campaign in August 2013 via Indiegogo.com with a $100,000 goal. Two months later, at the conclusion of the campaign, the band had only raised $8,739, falling 92% short of their goal.\nOn February 23, 2014, the band announced through their official website that the new single \"Wide Awake and Dead\" will be available through iTunes and Amazon on March 18, 2014. The \"Wide Awake and Dead\" video was filmed on April 22.\nIn 2015, they released their first collection of new music in 11 years, an EP titled Talk Sick. Originally, it was to be followed with another EP titled Entropy, but Gordon later told Westword Magazine the band would instead release it as a full-length album, that has yet to materialize.\nThe band performed at the 2023 edition of the Sick New World festival; their appearance drew criticism as the band appeared to heavily use playback instead of a live performance.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe band's sound has been described as alternative metal, nu metal, industrial rock, industrial metal, electronic rock, gothic rock, hard rock, and glam metal.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Related projects ==\nJulien-K – an electronic rock group founded by Derakh and Shuck in 2003.

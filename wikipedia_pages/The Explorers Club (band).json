    "text": "The Explorers Club are an American pop rock band originally from the coast of South Carolina, United States.  They feature a rotating cast of musicians led by Jason Brewer, whose debut album was released by Dead Oceans.  The music of their first album is heavily influenced by the vocal harmony styles and production of The Beach Boys. They are also influenced by classic rock and roll arrangements as made popular by The Beatles, Chuck Berry, Phil Spector, The Zombies, The Monkees and The Byrds. Their second album shows more influences of soft-pop artists of the early-1970s such as Burt Bacharach, Glen Campbell, etc.  The band relocated to Nashville, Tenn. in 2014 and released their third studio album 'Together' on 24 June 2016. On 12 June 2020 they released the self-titled album 'The Explorers Club' and an album of covers titled 'To Sing and Be Born Again' on Goldstar Recordings.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Explorers Club was formed in Charleston, South Carolina in 2005.  The group signed with indie record label Dead Oceans in June 2007 and released their debut album in 2008.  Their first single, \"Do You Love Me?\", was released in April of that year.  The Explorers Club's music has been featured on TV shows such as The O.C., How I Met Your Mother, and  Bored to Death. Several members of The Explorers Club were previously in a band called 1984. To promote the February 2012 release of Grand Hotel, the band released three free EPs called \"suites\", each containing a cover and two preliminary mixes of tracks set to appear on the album. The final mixes for the album were done by Mark Linett, who is known for his work with The Beach Boys. In 2014 and 2015, the band recorded their third studio album, Together, at Reel Recording in Nashville, Tenn. The album featured members of Brian Wilson's band, Nelson Bragg, Probyn Gregory, Scott Bennett, and Darian Sahanaja, and was co-produced by Jason Brewer, Mark Galup, and Erik Thompson. Together was released on 24 June 2016.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nFreedom Wind - Dead Oceans, 2008\nGrand Hotel - Rock Ridge Music, 2012\nTOGETHER - Goldstar Recordings, 2016\nThe Explorers Club - Goldstar Recordings, 2020\nTo Sing and Be Born Again - Goldstar Recordings, 2020\nWattage - Goldstar Recordings, 2021\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nThe Explorers Club - self-released, iTunes, 2006\nThe Californian Suite - Rock Ridge Music, 2011\nThe Carolinian Suite - Rock Ridge Music, 2011\nThe New Yorker Suite - Rock Ridge Music, 2011\nAll Aboard: Live at Patriots Point, 2015\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nDo You Love Me? / Carry Me - Dead Oceans, 2008\nIn 2012 the band recorded a version of Don't Pull Your Love for a fund raising cd titled \"Super Hits of the Seventies\" for radio station WFMU.\nNo Good to Cry, 2012\nDon't Waste Her Time, Burger Records, 2013\nChristmas Must Be Tonight, 2013\nWe've Only Just Begun, 2014\nThe Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore, 2019\n\n\n== Press ==\nSpin online:  Artist of the Day 03.07.08 .\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBand Website"

So I thought they were gonna go back, regroup, and try to make few more songs. [...] Joe said 'Slaughterhouse ain't hot right now, we don't have a buzz, we need to put out a mixtape.' From that point, everybody started branching out, Royce went and did his album, PRhyme, everybody started doing their own solo shit.\nIn January 2020, former group members Royce da 5'9\", Crooked I, and Joell Ortiz were featured on Eminem's eleventh studio album, Music to Be Murdered By, on the track \"I Will\".\nIn February 2022, Crooked I and Joell Ortiz announced a collaborative studio album titled Rise & Fall of Slaughterhouse, in which they addressed the group's fallout from their own perspectives. Royce da 5'9\" and Joe Budden were displeased with the project, as they viewed it as an attempt to tear down the Slaughterhouse brand for financial gain without consent from the rest of the group. On March 8, following a heated exchange between Royce, Budden, and Ortiz on Instagram Live, Crooked I gave further explanation about the situation, saying that he and Ortiz tried to get the group together for years but were unsuccessful, mainly due to Budden's lack of interest and cooperation, and that he and Ortiz wanted to make one final project to give their fans some closure.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\n\nSlaughterhouse (2009)\nWelcome to: Our House (2012)\n\n\n== References =="

Gavin joined as the drummer after being recommended to the duo by Iskandar (a schoolmate of Gavin's at Sekolah Sri KDU, and childhood friend of Iqbal's). Iskandar would later go on to join the band as their bassist.\nInsomniacks formed in 2015. In November of that year, the quartet would begin posting videos of themselves performing covers of popular songs on their YouTube channel.\n\n\n=== 2017–present: Debut and mainstream success with \"Pulang\" ===\nIn 2017, they released their debut single, \"Selalu\", which was featured as part of the soundtrack of the Astro Ria drama, My Coffee Prince.\nIn 2018, the group released their second single, \"Pulang\".

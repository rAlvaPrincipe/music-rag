    "text": "Dirge was a French post-metal band formed in 1994. From the industrial metal genre that exploded in the first part of the 90s, the band slowly evolved toward a more atmospheric and progressive form of metal, comparable to post-metal bands such as Neurosis and Isis.\n\n\n== History ==\nDirge was formed near Paris in 1994. The original band members were Marc T. (guitar / programming) and Laurent P. (vocals / programming). In the industrial genre of bands like Godflesh or Pitchshifter, the duet's music was a hybrid of corrosive guitars, robotic hammerings, and scratching samples. Three demo tapes were recorded during this first period.\nAfter the departure of Laurent, bass player David K. and guitarist Franck T. joined the band. This first change in the line-up coincided with a noisier and less electronic curve: dark, tortured, and dissonant, the first album Down, Last Level was released in 1998.\nIn 1999, Alain B. (drums) and Christophe \"Zomb\" D. (machines) joined the band. Re-humanized with the use of a real drum, the music of Dirge became much more massive and stifling, as the guitars became the center of gravity with the release of the second album Blight And Vision Below A Faded Sun (released in 2000 on the own band's label, Blight Records). With this record, the band took \"a further step toward a much heavier music with more progressive and dark compositions\", as written by C. Lorentz in the book \"Carnets Noirs, Acte II.\"\nReplacing Franck and David, Christian M. (bass) and guitarist Stéphane L. joined Dirge in 2001. Three years later, the third record, And Shall The Sky Descend, saw the light and presented a more psychedelic aspect of the band's music. If heavy guitars stayed in the center of the four long pieces that had built ASTSD, the extremely slow-downed tempos, creeping samples, minimal parts, violin, didgeridoo and female vocals of Von Magnet's Flore Magnet presented the result of four years of musical evolution.\nIn November 2006, the band went back into the studio to record its fourth album, Wings Of Lead Over Dormant Seas. Released one year later as a double CD set, it featured Kill the Thrill's singer Nicolas Dick on two tracks and received a notable welcome from the press, Terrorizer's J. C. Santos summing up about WOLODS that \"For once the word 'genius' is entirely appropriate\".\nApril 2011 saw the release of the fifth record, Elysian Magnetic Fields revealing new structures and atmospheres, full of melody and melancholy, highly praised by press and listeners.\n\"Elysian Magnetic Fields is a remarkable album, that has to be listened to, for it causes a direct feedback\" states German magazine Legacy.\nFor www.roadburn.com : \"This is a stunning release and unlikely to be bettered this year\".\nAfter several tours to promote the album (as well as some line-up changes), Dirge joins the roster of fine French avant-garde label Debemur Morti Productions (home of Blut Aus Nord, Behexen, Archgoat, Rosetta, Year of No Light).\nThe sixth album, Hyperion, was released in March 2014.\nIn March 2019, the band announced they had broken up.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Final lineup ===\nMarc T. – guitar, vocals, programming (1994–2019)\nAlain B. – drums (1999–2019)\nStephane L. – guitar (2001–2019)\nLuz – bass (2014–2019)\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nHichem A. – bass\nLaurent P. – vocals, programming (1994–1996)\nDavid K. – bass, vocals (1998–2001)\nFranck T. – guitar, vocals (1998–2001)\nChristop \"Zomb\" D. – samples (1999–2014)\nChristian M. – bass (2001–?)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nDown, Last Level (1998) – (It's Time to Records) – ITT 001176-2\nBlight And Vision Below A Faded Sun (2000) – (Blight Records) – BR 01\nAnd Shall The Sky Descend (2004) – (Blight Records) – BR02/1 / (Equilibre Music) – EM 014 /2007, reissue\nWings of Lead over Dormant Seas (2007) – (Equilibre Music/Blight Records) – EM 012/EML 012\nElysian Magnetic Fields (2011) – (Blight Records/Division Records) – DR 041\nHyperion (2014) – (Debemur Morti/Blight Records) – DMP 0104\nLost Empyrean (2018) – (Debemur Morti/Blight Records) – DMP 0167\nVanishing Point (2021) – (Division Records/Blight Records) – DR 083\n\n\n=== Demos ===\nInfected Brain Machine (1994)\nMind Time Control (1995)\nDead Network Access (1996)\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nHard Core Is A State Of Mind, (1996)\nLágrimas De Miedo Nº3, (1996)\nRock Sound 99, (2005)\nElegy Sampler 49, (2007)\nHard Rock Sampler 07, (2007)\nLágrimas De Miedo N°14 – Pornography: Re-heat  (2008)\nFalling Down Compilation (2008) -\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nDirge at AllMusic \nBandcamp\nFacebook\nDiscogs"

    "text": "Zodiac (Russian: Зодиак, Latvian: Zodiaks) was a Latvian space disco band active in the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic between 1980 and 1992. The band was extremely popular in the Soviet Union and has been credited by critics as the Soviet answer to the French band Space who were popular at the time.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nZodiac was formed by Jānis Lūsēns, then studying composition at the Latvian State Conservatory in Riga (now Jāzeps Vītols Latvian Academy of Music). The other four members of the group were also students of various faculties of the same conservatory.\nZodiac's first vinyl record Disco Alliance (Russian: Диско альянс, Latvian: Disko alianse) was released in 1980 on the monopolist Melodiya label, during the band members' studentship. The album was produced by Aleksandrs Grīva, the father of band member Zane Grīva. The music featured a lot of then-unusual synthesized sounds and effects together with more conventional euro disco elements.\nThe second album Music in the Universe (Russian: Музыка во Вселенной) released two years later was much inspired by a meeting with cosmonauts in the Star City, Moscow and their tales about space flights. The music of the second album was much more rock-influenced than the first.\nDuring that time the band also performed the music of Viktor Vlasov for the films Женские радости и печали (Woman's Joys and Sorrows, 1982) and Экипаж машины боевой (The Tank Crew, 1983), the soundtracks for both films were released on a vinyl record Music from the Films (Russian: Музыка из кинофильмов) in 1985. The music of the group was also used in the documentary film about the cosmonaut artist Alexei Leonov Звёздная палитра (Star Palette, 1982).\nThe album In memoriam was composed and produced by Jānis Lūsēns alone and released in 1989. The album was dedicated to the ancient and modern cultural and natural heritage of Latvia. The sounding of the album turned from disco to light techno/synthpop while gaining a lot of classical music influences as well as the influence of Jean Michel Jarre's ambient works.\nThe last album Clouds was released in 1991 by RiTonis (former Melodiya). It contains a hit song of the early 1990s in Latvia \"My favourite flowers\".\nDisco Alliance and Music in the Universe were released together on compact disc by Mikrofona Ieraksti (which represents EMI in the Baltic states).\nIn the early 2000s, the Russian electronic duo PPK recorded a remix of Zodiac's composition \"Zodiac\" from the Disco Alliance album. This remix, titled \"Reload\", entered the charts in a number of territories.\nIn 2016, the band appeared on New Year's Eve show on Russian Channel One, performing \"Pacific\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAll the albums are equally known under their Russian and English titles and had both spellings on their original covers.\n\nDisco Alliance (1980)\nZodiac\nPacific\nProvincial Disco\nPolo\nMirage\nRock on the Ice\nAlliance\nMusic in the Universe (1982)\nThe Mysterious Galaxy\nLaser Illumination\nSilver Dream\nPhoto Finish\nThe Other Side of Heaven\nIn the Light of Saturn\nFlight Over El Dorado\nMusic from the films (Музыка из kинофильмов, Muzyka iz kinofilmov) (1985) (Russian only)\n\nIn memoriam (1989) (Russian only)\nIn Memoriam / V Kurzeme (In Courland)\nOstrov Moritsala (Moricsala Island)\nV Muzeye Pod Otkrytym Nebom (In the Open Air Museum)\nRundalskiy Dvorets (Rundāle Palace)\nDoma Staroy Rigi (Houses of Old Riga)\nPastorale (bergerette)\nNa Gore Zilayskalns (On the Mount Zilaiskalns)\nMākoņi (Clouds) (1991) (Latvian only)\nPakrēšļa puķes (Twilight Flowers)\nStaburags un saules meitiņa (Staburags and the Daughter of the Sun)\nVeltījums (Dedication)\nDaugava (Daugava River)\nManas mīļākās puķes(My Favourite Flowers)\nMākoņi (Clouds)\nEs tevis meklēju (Searching for You)\nRotaļa (A Game)\nBohēmieša dziesma (Bohemian's Song)\n\n\n== Line-up ==\nSince the group rarely performed live every new album had a new line-up except the producer Jānis Lūsēns.\nDisco Alliance:\n\nJānis Lūsēns – ARP Omni, ARP Odyssey, celesta, production\nZane Grīva – piano, ARP Omni, vocals\nAndris Sīlis – guitar\nAinārs Ašmanis – bass guitar\nAndris Reinis – drums\nAleksander Grīva – production\nMusic in the Universe:\n\nJānis Lūsēns – piano, Yamaha SK-50D, production\nAivars Gudrais – guitar on tracks 2–4, 6\nDzintars Sāgens – guitar on tracks 1, 5, 7\nIvars Piļka – bass guitar\nAndris Reinis – drums\nAleksander Grīva – production\nThe line-up on Music from the Films is unknown, the original CD cover has only the following info:\n\nViktor Vlasov – composition\nAleksander Grīva – producing, sound engineering\nIn memoriam:\n\nJānis Lūsēns – synthesizers, piano, production\nZigfrīds Muktupāvels – vocals, DDD-1, violin\nDzintars Sāgens – computer, guitar\nGuntis Zvirgzdiņš – synthesizer\nMaija Lūsēna – vocals on track 4\nNormunds Šnē – oboe on track 3\nAivars Gudrais – guitar on track 5\nIvars Piļka – sound engineering\nClouds:\n\nJānis Lūsēns – synthesizers, piano, production\nMaija Lūsēna – vocals\nZigfrīds Muktupāvels – vocals, programming, violin\nAivars Gudrais – guitar\nGatis Gaujenieks – sound engineering\nIvars Piļka – sound engineering\nP.

    "text": "Les Surveillantes is a French Canadian musical group based in the Saint Boniface district of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Their music integrates many genres, such as folk and indie, and it was inspired from bluegrass. The band has performed across Canada.\nThey generally mix banjos, guitars and bass with two microphones for the four members. Each member is a singer, instrumentalist, and composer.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe four founding members had played in other Franco-Manitoban groups before 2006. They met at 100NONS, an organization for French music in Manitoba. They began by performing concerts in Saint-Boniface in Manitoba.\nAfter winning the  Festival international de la chanson de Granby public prize and three other awards at the Chant'Ouest tour in 2009, the group became more popular  at  national level.  After their success in the Réseau National des Galas de la chanson, the group toured in Canada and performed at many festivals, including  Coup de Coeur francophone Montreal, and Winnipeg in November 2009, and in  2010 the Festival Vue sur la Relève at Montreal in 2010, the Chicane Albertaine at Nordegg, and the Festival international de la chanson de Granby (out of contest).\nIn 2011, Les Surveillantes were nominated for a Canadian Folk Music Award and a Western Canada Music Award. They performed at the Festival des cultures francophones de Halifax. In November of that year, Danielle Burke left the band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nMon grand sapin (single) (2020)\nFeu les artifices (2020)\nLa racine carrée du coeur (2010)\nLes Surveillantes (Maxi disque format court) (2009)\n\n\n== Awards ==\nNominated Artiste ou groupe de l'Ouest canadien par excellence, Gala des Prix Trille Or (2011)\nWon Prix SACEF/Place des Arts, Contact Ouest (2010)\nWon Prix du public, Festival International de la Chanson de Granby (2009)\nWon Prix André-Mercure, Chant'Ouest (2009)\nWon Prix Étoile Galaxie, Chant'Ouest (2009)\nWon Prix du public, Chant'Ouest (2009)\nWon Prix du jury, Gala Manitobain de la Chanson (2009)\nWon Prix du public, Gala Manitobain de la Chanson (2009)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of bands from Canada\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\n\n== External links ==\nLes Surveillantes official website\nPreste.ca Archived 2010-11-20 at the Wayback Machine"

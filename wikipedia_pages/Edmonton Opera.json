    "text": "Edmonton Opera is a professional Canadian opera company in Edmonton, Alberta. In the past they regularly performed at the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium, but in recent years have been branching out and performing at a variety of stages throughout the city of Edmonton. The Edmonton Opera office is home to a box office, production space, and costume workshop, and is located at #102, 11442 1168 Street NW, Edmonton AB. Last year, in their 2023/24 season, they celebrated their 60th anniversary season. \n\n\n== History ==\nApproximately six amateur opera companies pre-date the Edmonton Opera’s founding in 1963. After Mrs. J.B. Carmichael’s death in 1964, singers who had been involved with the Edmonton Operatic Society approached local pianist and voice teacher Jean Letourneau about working with them. After a number of successful productions, the group changed its name to the Edmonton Professional Opera Association, with David Ker as the first president and Letourneau as the music director. \"Professional\" was dropped from the company’s name in August 1966, as the then-artistic director, Irving Guttman, argued that it should be obvious to all if a company is professional.\nThe first season, 1963/64, featured two productions: Madama Butterfly  in October 1963, and Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci in April 1964. In 1966, Letourneau convinced Guttman, then at the Vancouver Opera, to come to Edmonton. The artistic director from 1966 to 1998, Guttman would be a part of all four Western Canadian opera companies — Vancouver (founded 1958), Edmonton (founded 1963), Manitoba (founded 1969) and Calgary (founded 1972).\nUntil 2008, the opera guild was one of many forms of support for the opera. Founded by Thelma Gregg, the group held many successful fundraisers and ensured everyone backstage was well-fed.\n\n\n== Production History ==\nThe number of productions each year varies from two operas to as many as five, although five operas have been presented only twice in the company's history, in 1992/93 and 1993/94. \nRepertoire includes the classic operatic works, as well as a handful of more contemporary pieces, especially in more recent years. The 2024/25 season offers four main shows and other satellite events and productions alongside their season. The main productions will be:\n1. Die Fledermaus\n2. Bluebeard's Castle\n3. Aquarius: Songs of the Stars\n4. Die Walküre \n\nThis history may be incomplete, but is based on a timetoast page hosted by the company here. \n\n\n== Education ==\nWith the aid of technology, the company is able to share operatic resources across northern Alberta, including educational guides, programs and other resources. Field trips for students in Edmonton are arranged for the second dress rehearsal, when they can visit the Northern Alberta Jubilee, watch the performance, and often, chorus and cast members come out to the lobby to chat during intermissions.\nBetween 1973 and 1984, Edmonton Opera on Tour brought opera to children in schools across Alberta, from bigger centres such as Grande Prairie to smaller communities such as Holden. Through this program, there were approximately 200 performances per year.\n\n\n== Community ==\nThe Edmonton Opera has partnered with many other arts organizations in Edmonton, including the Alberta Craft Council and the Shumka Ukrainian Dancers. The Edmonton Opera is also the largest employer of the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n== References =="

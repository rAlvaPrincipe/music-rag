    "text": "If You Don't Fight You Lose is the first album by Redgum. The title is taken from a line in the song \"Killing Floor\".\nIt was originally released on vinyl and cassette. It was very briefly available on CD in the late 80s, through a licensing deal with budget label Rainbow. It has never been re-released, although some tracks were included on the 2004 Redgum collection Against the Grain.\nThe band at this time was a part-time group and far less polished than they later became, they were still taking form. The songs address topical issues, such as unemployment, US influence, the effects of white settlement on Australia's aboriginal population, and more.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"One More Boring Night In Adelaide\" (J.

    "text": "Lost Kings are an American DJ duo consisting of Robert Abisi and Nick Shanholtz, based in Los Angeles. The duo gained popularity beginning in 2014 through their official remixes for artists such as Imagine Dragons, Krewella, Halsey, Vance Joy, Echosmith, Rihanna, and Tori Kelly, and through their original progressive house music. Managed by Disruptor Management, a joint venture at Sony Music Entertainment, they signed to Disruptor Records/RCA Records in October 2016.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nDJ Robert Abisi (also known as Rob Gainley), was born in Boston, Massachusetts and Nick Shanholtz (also known as Dr. No) a writer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist, was born in Baltimore, Maryland. The two met through a mutual friend and started the project when the duo talked about collaborating in music on Abisi's 25th birthday in 2014. The duo begin using 'Lost Kings' as a stage name because they 'felt lost' moving to Los Angeles and had goals they wanted to accomplish.\n\n\n=== Members ===\n\n\n==== Robert Abisi ====\nAbisi grew up in Andover, Massachusetts and initially had dreams to become a professional athlete but was always surrounded by music. After realizing the ambition was very unlikely to become true, he became a DJ and producer. He was able to meet many of his favorite musical artists, such as Coldplay, at a young age because his father worked in the radio industry. In school, he started music blogs to introduce people to new music. When he was 19 years old, his parents bought him a DJ controller for Christmas as they realized about his musical passion. The year after that, he found out that his father was diagnosed with throat cancer when he was about to leave for a 'study-abroad' program in London. Just like that, he was in London, his aunt died due to cancer and his grandmother's husband too died. His father had been cancer-free since December 2009. He graduated from James Madison University in Virginia in 2011 and moved to Los Angeles. He wanted to pursue a musical career as a solo artist and had tried to book DJ gigs.\n\n\n==== Nick Shanholtz ====\nShanholtz grew up on the East Coast and in Baltimore, Maryland. He wanted to become a professional musician (specifically, drummer in a band). He started playing the drums when he was 8 years old. He began playing the piano and guitar at 15 and realized he wanted to write and produce music. He went to Patapsco High School and Center for the Arts, and later went to Berklee College of Music in Boston. In 2010, he moved to Los Angeles to enroll in the LA Recording School. Upon arrival in LA, he had struggled to make friends until he met Abisi and surrounded himself with the right people.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2014–2015 ===\nLost Kings was launched in 2014 by members Robert Abisi and Nick Shanholtz.

Disruptor agreed with their visions of establishing themselves as artists with remixes before producing original songs. When asked about their diverse musical style, Shanholtz said they didn't want to be only recognized in a particular genre as that would make them 'predictable'.

    "text": "The Rosé Quartet was a string quartet formed by Arnold Rosé in 1882.\nIt was active for 55 years, until 1938.\n\n\n== Members ==\nIts members changed over time.\nRosé was first violin throughout. Julius Egghard Jr. played the second violin at first; then it was Albert Bachrich, until 1905 when Paul Fischer joined. Violist was initially Anton Loh, then Hugo von Steiner until 1901 when Anton Ruzitska came on; after 1920, Max Handl played the viola. Eduard Rosé, Arnold’s brother, had been a founding member of the ensemble playing the cello, but left after one season to get married and was replaced by Reinhold Hummer, who was in turn replaced by Friedrich Buxbaum; cellist Anton Walter joined in 1921, but later on Buxbaum rejoined.\nThe group's peak period was between 1905 and 1920, with Rosé, Fischer, Ruzitska, and Buxbaum.\n\n\n== Repertoire ==\nThe quartet's repertoire was based around the works of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, but many contemporary composers also benefited from the quartet's support, including Arnold Schoenberg.\n\n\n== Associations ==\nThe group participated in the Vienna premieres of works by Brahms, including his Clarinet Quintet and his Quintet in G major Opus 111. It also premiered Schoenberg's first and second string quartets and participated in the premiere of Verklärte Nacht along with two members of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra: Franz Jelinek, viola, and Franz Schmidt, violoncello. Among the quartet's performing collaborators were Julius Röntgen, Johannes Brahms, Franz Steiner, Bruno Walter, and Richard Mühlfeld. The quartet also made recordings.\n\n\n== References in popular culture ==\nBaroness Lemburg in The White Liars by Peter Shaffer claims that her father played with \"The Rosé String Quartet\" and knew them intimately.\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Arnold Rose\".

    "text": "T-ara (; Korean: 티아라) is a South Korean girl group formed in 2009, currently consisting of four members: Qri, Eunjung, Hyomin, and Jiyeon. T-ara's career is marked by hook-heavy dance-pop music, a result of their close partnership with late composer Shinsadong Tiger. A broad array of visual concepts have earned the group a \"chameleon-like\" reputation. The group has achieved commercial success in several regions in Asia including South Korea and China, with their single \"Roly-Poly\" (2011) being one of the most downloaded domestic singles since 2010 and the most downloaded girl group single to date.\nT-ara made their debut with the single \"Lies\" in 2009. Their debut studio album Absolute First Album (2009) was well received critically and spawned the hit singles \"TTL (Time to Love)\", \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\", and \"You Drive Me Crazy\". Both their debut Japanese single and studio album reached number one on the Oricon weekly charts and were subsequently certified gold. They subsequently gained nationwide recognition after releasing \"Roly-Poly\" (2011), and its remix \"Roly-Poly In Copacabana\" (2011) which went on to become the Gaon chart's best-selling single of the year. At the height of K-pop's popularity in Japan, T-ara signed onto management agency J-Rock for $4.7 million—reportedly the highest figure of any Korean girl group expanding into the territory at the time. T-ara's Korean EP Black Eyes (2011) spawned three consecutive number ones: \"Cry Cry\", \"We Were in Love\" and \"Lovey-Dovey\".\nIn 2012, T-ara experienced a dip in popularity as the group faced accusations of internal discord, resulting in Hwayoung's immediate departure with Areum following a year after. T-ara's later material was released to varying degrees of success in South Korea before the group began focusing on international promotional activities, especially in China, which resulted in the release of for their cover of Chopstick Brothers' \"Little Apple\". \nT-ara's final release as six members was tentatively scheduled for May 2017, ahead of Soyeon and Boram's expiring contracts; however, conflicts with their management delayed What's My Name? until June 2017, effectively ending their involvement. After a four year hiatus, T-ara reunited and released their first independent single album, Re:T-ara, in 2021. According to Sina Entertainment, T-ara has sold 1.14 million physical albums as of December 2020, and is one of the best-selling girl groups of all time.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe group's name, T-ara, is based on the English word for \"tiara\". The name T-ara stems from the idea that they will become the \"queens of the music industry\". This later inspired their official fandom name, QUEEN's.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2009–2010: Formation, debut and breakthrough ===\nThe original pre-debut five T-ara members (Jiae, Jiwon, Eunjung, Hyomin and Jiyeon) trained together for nearly three years under Mnet Media. In April 2009, they released their pre-debut song \"Good Person\" for the Cinderella Man soundtrack. The song is a remake of SG Wannabe's soundtrack of the same name. It reached the top 50 positions on multiple streaming platforms as well as the top soundtrack charts. Jiyeon teamed up with labelmates SeeYa and Davichi for a collaboration single titled \"Women's Generation\", which was released in May 2009. The single achieved nationwide success and became the group's first Top 3 single on the charts.\nIn June 2009, Mnet Media announced that Jiae and Jiwon would be leaving T-ara due to differences in music style. The first new member to be added to the group was Boram, the daughter of singer Jeon Young-rok and actress Lee Mi-young. Soyeon, a former trainee of SM Entertainment who was supposed to be  a main vocalist and the leader of Girls' Generation, and Qri, a famous top Ulzzang at the time, were added to T-ara three weeks prior to debut. In early July 2009, the group was moved from Mnet Media to its subsidiary company Core Contents Media.\nT-ara made their debut on MBC's Radio Star talk show on July 29, 2009 which was unusual for Korean artists who usually debuted on music programs instead. Their first performance was on Mnet's M Countdown on July 30, where they performed \"Lies\" and b-side track \"Wanna Play?\" from their debut single. On July 30, CCM announced that the group received 13 invitations to variety shows only a day after debut. All tracks from the single debuted on online streaming platforms' top 100 charts, while \"Lies\", peaked at number five on MelOn.\nIn September 2009, Eunjung, Soyeon, Hyomin and Jiyeon collaborated with labelmates Kwangsu, Jihyuk, and Geonil of Supernova for the single \"TTL (Time to Love)\". It was released on September 15, 2009, and became both groups' first number one song as all Korean online charts. T-ara and Supernova collaborated again for \"TTL Listen 2\", an alternate version of \"TTL (Time to Love)\", which was released on October 9, 2009, and included all the members from both groups.\n\nT-ara released their debut studio album, Absolute First Album, on November 27, 2009. In order to determine the album's title track, Core Contents Media held a survey in which the public had to choose between \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" or \"Like the First Time\". 9,000 people took the survey on various music portals with 53% (4,770 people) choosing \"Like The First Time\" over \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\". However, the latter was promoted on music shows instead for unknown reasons. \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" peaked at number four on the Gaon chart, while \"Like The First\" peaked at number ten. They held their comeback performance on Music Bank on December 4, 2009. At the 24th Golden Disk Awards, T-ara was awarded Rookie of the Year along with 4minute.\n\nThe group won their first-ever music show award with \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" on the New Year's Day episode of Music Bank. The song went on to win five awards in total: two on Music Bank and three on Inkigayo, earning them their first \"Triple Crown\". Later in January 2010, the group announced promotions for their b-side track, \"Like The First Time\", which ended quickly as Soyeon was diagnosed with H1N1. The same month, T-ara made a cameo appearance on the seventh and eight episodes of God of Study, in which Jiyeon played a main role.\nIn February 2010, the group announced a re-release of their debut album under the title Breaking Heart. The lead single, \"You Drive Me Crazy\" and b-side track \"I'm Really Hurt\", were digitally released on February 23, 2010, and peaked at number one and number thirty-one on the Gaon chart, respectively.\nT-ara held their comeback performance on the same day on M Countdown, and won several music awards for \"You Drive Me Crazy\" over the course of their promotions: two consecutive Mutizen wins on Inkigayo  and one first place award on M Countdown. Breaking Heart was released physically on March 3, 2010, peaking at number two on the weekly Gaon chart and number thirty-five on the yearly chart; selling 40,695 copies. After promotions for \"You Drive Me Crazy\" ended, T-ara performed \"I'm Really Hurt\" on music shows until early April 2010. In June 2010, the group donated all the proceeds of the World Cup merchandise sold on their online clothing shop T-ara Dot Com to a charity for African children. On July 16, 2010, T-ara representatives announced the addition of Hwayoung Ryu as the seventh member of the group. The reason given was that with so many solo projects, they would be able to have a more complete lineup for T-ara when individual members were filming or doing other appearances. They also stated that it would allow the members to undertake more solo activities, and would give them all some relief from their heavy schedules. \"You Drive Me Crazy\" ended up being the third best selling girl group song of the year, several other T-ara songs were also placed at Gaon's year-end singles.\nIn November 2010, the group was in the third season of the reality show Hello Baby, in which they took care of Moon Mason and his two brothers. T-ara released the digital download for \"Wae Ireoni\", the lead single for their first extended play, Temptastic, on November 23, 2010. Temptastic was released in digital format on December 1, 2010, along with their second single, \"Yayaya\". The album's physical release was delayed until December 3 due to the bombardment of Yeonpyeong earlier in November 2010.\nT-ara held their first comeback performance through Music Bank on December 3 and began promotions with their new seventh member, Hwayoung, and new leader, Boram, and received two consecutive wins for \"Wae Ireoni\" and \"Yayaya\" on M Countdown.\n\n\n=== 2011–2012: International expansion and bullying controversy ===\n\nT-ara's second EP John Travolta Wannabe was released on June 29, 2011. It charted at number three on the Gaon Album Chart and has sold 30,116 copies as of 2011. The EP's only single, \"Roly-Poly\", peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart and number one on the Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart. The single became a breakthrough success, becoming the top-grossing and highest-selling single of 2011 in South Korea with over four digital million units sold. \"Roly-Poly\" was awarded Best Music Video at the 3rd Melon Music Awards and Singer of the Year (July) at the 1st Gaon Chart Awards, and was nominated Best Dance Performance by a Female Group and Song of the Year at the 13th Mnet Asian Music Awards.\nThe group released a limited edition re-issue of John Travolta Wannabe, titled Roly-Poly in Copacabana, on August 2, 2011. It featured an alternate version of \"Roly Poly\" ,\"Roly-Poly in Copacabana\", is a eurodance remix of \"Roly-Poly\", named after the song \"Copacabana\" which was popularized in the 80's in Jongno disco clubs. The album peaked at number three, while the single peaked at number forty and forty-five on the Gaon and Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 charts. The group began follow up promotions for the remixed single on Music Bank. T-ara released their debut Japanese single \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" on September 28, which peaked at number one on the Oricon weekly singles chart with over  49.7 thousand copies sold, making them the first non-Japanese girl group to rank at number one for a debut single in Oricon history. The single peaked at number one on the Billboard Japan Hot 100, and was certified Gold by the RIAJ for both full-length cellphone downloads and PC downloads.\n\nIn November 2011, T-ara released their third extended play Black Eyes which charted at number two on the Gaon charts. The album was preceded by the release of \"Cry Cry\", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 and won two consecutive first-place awards on M Countdown. The music video for \"Cry Cry\" was noted for having a billion South Korean won production budget and a thirty-minute drama story line. The group released their second Japanese single, a remake of \"Yayaya\" from their Temptastic EP, on November 30. The single peaked at number seven on the Oricon charts and number six on the Billboard Japan Hot 100.\nIn December 2011, Core Contents Media announced that T-ara's third leader Hyomin would be passing on her leadership to Soyeon. The group performed a three-day mini-concert tour titled X-mas Premium Live, that was held at the Shinagawa Stella Hall in Tokyo, the Zepp in Nagoya, and the Zepp in Osaka. T-ara rose to become the second biggest girl group in Korea in 2011 by ranking at number eight on the Gallup Korea poll. T-ara and Davichi released their Christmastide ballad,  \"We Were in Love\" on December 23, 2011; it was later included on T-ara's Funky Town re-release album. The single reached number one on the Gaon Chart and peaked at number two on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100. Both groups performed the song weekly on SBS's Inkigayo. In November 2011, CCM announced that T-ara will not be attending any year-end award ceremonies due to their heavy schedules in and outside South Korea, which resulted in the group's immediate elimination from most of the country's award nomination lists.\nT-ara re-released Black Eyes under the title Funky Town on January 3, 2012. The album peaked at number one on the Gaon weekly album chart and number two on the monthly album chart, selling 76.749 copies. \"Lovey-Dovey\" was released as the second single from the album, which peaked at number one on both the Gaon and Billboard Korea K-pop Hot 100 charts. The single has sold more than 3 million digital copies in South Korea alone. In February, Forbes Korea, in celebration of their ninth year of establishment, reported the year's list of the \"Top 40 Power Celebrities\". T-ara ranked on the list at number seventeen, thus making them as the third most powerful girl group and the seventh most powerful female celebrity in Korea.\n\nOn June 14, 2012, Core Contents Media introduced 18-year-old Areum as the new maknae (막내, youngest member). On May 23, T-ara released \"Round & Round\", a remake of Nami's 1984 hit. The song received both critical and commercial success becoming the group's seventh top ten hit in South Korea since 2010. It received generally positive reviews from critics praising T-ara for bringing it a new fresh sound. It was selected by SPIELTIMES as one of the best K-Pop remakes.\nThe group released their first Japanese album Jewelry Box on June 6, 2012. The album debuted at number two on the Oricon weekly albums chart with sales of over 57,000 copies. The album was later certified Gold by RIAJ for physical sales shipments. They embarked on their first Japanese concert tour T-ara Japan Tour 2012: Jewelry Box in Nagoya on June 19; the tour's attendance was expected to exceed 40,000 people. On July 3, T-ara released their fourth extended play, Day by Day, which charted at number five on the Gaon chart. The title track, \"Day by Day\", was released as a single on the same day, peaking at number two. The first comeback performance for \"Day by Day\" was held on July 7, 2012, on Music Core, which was backed by a 70-person orchestra and featured the stage debut of the group's eighth member, Areum.\n\nOn July 25 and 26, T-ara held a concert in Japan, with Hwayoung only performing one song due to an alleged leg injury. After the concert, Hyomin took to Twitter, posting \"There are differences in levels of determination. Let us have more determination\", the other members agreed, with Jiyeon posting \"The differences in levels of determination ^^, Always be humble ^^ and sensible ^^ I applaud you, acting genius ^^\". Subsequently, Hwayoung tweeted \"Sometimes, even determination alone is not enough. At times like these, I feel upset but I trust that it's a blessing in disguise from the heavens. God, you know everything right?\", while her sister Hyoyoung wrote \"My better half is suffering. My heart hurts. No matter what anyone else says, (Hwayoung), you can get through this\". This event caused Korean netizens to suspect that there was conflict between the group members, resulting in many netizens retweeting the messages and speculating that Hwayoung was being bullied, sparking a large firestorm of controversy and backlash against the members. On July 30, Core Contents Media abruptly announced Hwayoung's immediate departure from the group after one year and eight months, with CCM's CEO, Kim Kwang-soo, claiming that Hwayoung's contract was terminated because staff members felt her behavior was hurting teamwork, and that the bullying controversy was not the reason for her departure. By this point public opinion was almost universally in favor of Hwayoung, and the extreme negative reaction the other members received caused the group to temporarily suspend activities (although the members continued with their individual activities). At the time, both sides of the situation said that there was no bullying, only natural conflicts between the members.\nIt was announced that there would be no changes to T-ara's upcoming comeback; however, their agency later took the statement back and announced that their comeback would be postponed indefinitely. Their Day by Day extended play re-issue, Mirage, was eventually released on September 3, 2012. The title track \"Sexy Love\" and the promotional singe \"Day and Night\", were released from the album on the same day, with \"Sexy Love\" peaking at number four on the Gaon charts and number three on the Billboard Korea K-pop Hot 100 charts. \"Day and Night\" was a collaboration single featuring T-ara's Areum with Gun-ji of Gavy NJ and Shannon.\nOn September 10, 2012, it was announced that the group would release a best of album in Japan consisting of all of their Korean singles to date (excluding \"Day by Day\" and \"Sexy Love\") in celebration of one year since their Japanese debut. The album was eventually released on October 10. On September 26, T-ara released the Japanese version of \"Day by Day\", which is mainly composed of scenes from their Korean music videos for that song. In October, T-ara released the Japanese version of \"Sexy Love\" and shortly after, the group departed to Japan to promote for their upcoming single.\nIn September 2012, T-ara was offered ₩10 billion in funding for an Asia tour including China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. With 20 stops, the tour was set with concerts in arenas with 10,000–20,000 seats adding up to over 150,000 in total attendance.\n\n\n=== 2013–2014: Subunits, Again, and And & End ===\nT-ara released their sixth Japanese single \"Bunny Style!\" on March 20, 2013.

Despite Hwayoung having initially claimed that there was no bullying, she now described the situation as her having been \"hated\" and \"bullied\" by the other members as well as describing how \"hard\" everything had been for her and how her sister was the only person who had supported her during the incident. Shortly after the interview aired, however, a former staff member stepped forwards and alleged that it had actually been the twins who were the ones to \"bully\" the other members, and released texts that appeared to show Hyoyoung threatening former member Areum with physical harm for not supporting Hwayoung's behavior. Soon afterwards, more and more staff members came forward with evidence that Hwayoung had been disrespectful to the other members as well as stylists and that she had actually had dramatically over-exaggerated how severe her initial injury was in order to get more sympathy. Hwayoung initially tried to deny the rumors, lashing out at the staffers in return, but eventually admitted that the texts were real. After suffering from an intense backlash, including being removed from several television shows, Hwayoung deleted her Instagram account.\n\nOn March 6, 2017, MBK Entertainment announced that T-ara would be releasing their final album with the company in May, with Soyeon and Boram terminating their contracts after its release.

They sold 2.5 million copies in Japan.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nThe band's roots were first formed when Red Rice and Han-kun first performed together in Shōnan in central coastal Japan. Han-kun first formed an interest in reggae after by chance hearing Buju Banton's song \"Untold Stories\" in a friend's girlfriend's car, after coming home from a dance. Red Rice was a casual fan of reggae/hip-hop, until attending festivals which made him develop a great love of these genres. The pair met Shock Eye while performing, who previously worked as a hip-hop DJ. Shock Eye was friends with Wakadanna in high school, and met him again by chance in Shōnan. Wakadanna had been managing a reggae bar in Shōnan.\nFrom 2001 onwards, the band worked together, having songs featured on compilation albums and collaborating with other artists. The band made their major label debut in 2003, under Toy's Factory.\nThe band's second album Shōnan no Kaze: Ragga Parade reached #5 on Oricon charts, after two top 20 singles. The band had a hit song in 2006, \"Junrenka\" (純恋歌, Pure Love Song). It sold over 520,000 copies and was the 8th biggest hit of 2006. The follow-up album, Shōnan no Kaze: Riders High, reached #1.\nThe band has had other hits since then, such as \"Ōgon Soul,\" \"Koi Shigure\" and \"Gachi-zakura.\" The band's 4th album, Shōnan no Kaze: Joker, reached #1 on Oricon charts as well.\nIn 2012, the group provided the song \"Born to be Wild\" from their 2012 Entenka album for their first Yakuza title, Kurohyō 2: Ryū ga Gotoku Ashura hen (Japanese: クロヒョウ2　龍が如く 阿修羅編, lit. \"Black Panther: Like a Dragon Ashura Chapter\"), for the final boss fight with Nozaki Ryo. The song is also part of the game's official soundtrack.\nHan-kun released a solo-album in 2008. The band released the first of their planned \"Best of\" albums on March 6, 2013.\nIn 2013, the group provided the song \"Just Live More\" for the TV series Kamen Rider Gaim under the name Gaim no Kaze (鎧武乃風, Gaimu no Kaze).\nIn 2015, the group provided the opening song for their second Yakuza game Yakuza 0, titled \"Bubble\", and its ending, titled \"Kurenai\".\nIn 2016, the group provided the opening and closing themes \"Ike!

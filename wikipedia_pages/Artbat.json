    "text": "Artbat (commonly styled as ARTBAT) is a Ukrainian DJ and music production duo from Kyiv, consisting of Artur Kryvenko and Vitaliy \"Batish\" Limarenko. They produce music in various techno and house variations.\n\n\n== Career ==\nArtbat's career began in 2014 when Kryvenko and Lamarenko, both experienced DJs, met in a Ukrainian club. After they quickly recognized musical similarities, they started producing music together. Just three months later, they had their breakthrough with the track \"Mandrake\". They received great support from the British DJ Richie Hawtin, who played the track in each of his sets for a year.\nIn 2017, Artbat's track uplift was published as part of a compilation on Solomun's label Diynamic, followed by further EPs and tracks on the label. Their track \"Taboo\", released in 2018, reached the top position of the deep house charts on the music platform Beatport and was able to stay there for eleven weeks. In 2019 they won a DJ Award in the Breakthrough category. In the same year they became the best-selling artist on Beatport. In 2021 they founded their own label, named Upperground.\n\n\n== Career Highlights ==\nArtbat have performed on a variety of prominent festival stages including Tomorrowland, Coachella, EDC, and Awakenings. They also held a residency at David Guetta's weekly event, called Future Rave, at the world’s No.1 club - Hï Ibiza.

Artbat was recognized as the Breakthrough Artist of the Year by The DJ Awards in 2019. That same year they were named Mixmag's Stars of the Year and Beatport's Best Sellers, further solidifying their influence and impact in the electronic music industry. On November 11, 2023, Artbat recorded their first ever Essential Mix for BBC Radio 1. \n\n\n== Achievements & Collaborations ==\nArtbat have collaborated with a number of high-profile electronic music artists and producers, including Pete Tong, David Guetta, Armin van Buuren, CamelPhat, Sailor & I, and John Martin.

Based on true events, the German show was developed for Netflix, where it was first aired in October 2021 along with an additional feature story episode.\n\n\n== Hey Boy Hey Girl Remix ==\nIn May 2024, Artbat’s official remix of \"Hey Boy Hey Girl\" by The Chemical Brothers was released by Virgin/Positiva. The remix was commissioned as part of the 25th anniversary celebration of the now-classic track, which was first released in May 1999.

It has been a standout in their performances throughout 2024.\n\n\n== Cercle Performance ==\nIn March 2019 Artbat performed for groundbreaking YouTube broadcaster Cercle atop Sugarloaf Mountain (Bondinho Pão de Açúcar) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

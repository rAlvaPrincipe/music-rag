    "text": "Spiral Dance is an Adelaide-based Pagan folk rock band whose musical focus is on the concepts of magic, myth and legend.\nFusing folk-lore and legend with a good heady serve of pagan mystery, Spiral Dance presents an eclectic blend of traditional English folk-rock with powerful self-penned songs and tunes. \nThe band was formed in 1992 as a project to explore some of the more mystical elements in life and has drawn its energy from the songwriting and vocal skills of Adrienne Piggott. Adrienne's lyrics are supported by guitar and button accordion, underpinned with bass and percussion, all arranged to blend acoustic folk-rock with Celtic harmony.\nTo date, the band has released nine albums along with appearing on the Green Album and toured extensively in Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom.  Highlights include playing concerts with Damh the Bard, Witchfest International, Glastonbury Faerie Ball, The Mercian Gathering and numerous shows throughout the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Current band line-up ==\nAdrienne Piggott : vocals\nRena Lannigan: guitar\nPaul Gooding : button accordion/vocals\nMatt Colyer : drums/percussion\nNigel Walters : bass guitar\nSimon Despoja : Violin\n\n\n== Discography ==\nWoman of the Earth (1996)\nOver the Nine Waves (1997)\nMagick (1999)\nNotes of Being (2002)\nThe Quickening (2006)\nLive - Worts 'n' All (2007)\nFrom The Mist, A Retrospective (2010)\nThrough A Sylvan Doorway (2012)\nWickerman - single release (2014)\nThe Green Album (2016)\nLand and Legend (2017)\n\n\n=== Promotional singles ===\nSpirit of the Green - from The Green Album (2016)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nFacebook\nMyspace"

The \"ensemble has become renowned for their distinct sound, which reinterprets some of the most famous hip-hop productions of all time (right on down to the sample material) into a unique blend of big band jazz and live hip-hop\".\n\n\n== Band members ==\nAbstract Orchestra is conducted and led by Scottish Saxophonist Rob Mitchell, who also writes and arranges the music, and produces the recordings.

They explore the shared territory between jazz and hip hop by taking modern classics such as Madvillain and J Dilla's back catalogue and filtering them through classic arrangement techniques.\"\nAbstract Orchestra blends jazz orchestration with hip hop beats and MC's. The group also explores a number of influential sounds favoured by hip-hop producers, such as Motown, Jazz, TV soundtrack and film scores. Rob Mitchell cites his influences as Quincy Jones, Lalo Schifrin, David Shire, Paul Riser, Bob Brookmeyer, Gil Evans, J Dilla, Madlib, and MF DOOM.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was formed in 2011 by Rob Mitchell and Dave Walker, initially for a one-off event at The Wardrobe club in Leeds. The event led to further performances including support for Mos Def aka Yasiin Bey, Filming for the MOBO awards in 2014, and supporting Talib Kweli and the Zulu Nation tour in 2015.\nAbstract Orchestra's debut album 'Dilla' was released in 2017 and covered the music of Detroit Producer J Dilla. This was followed by the 'Abstract Orchestra Does Dilla' UK Tour in 2017, and included venues Jazz Caf√©, O2 Academy Sheffield and Band on the Wall\nFor their second and third releases 'Madvillain Vol. 1' (2018) and 'Madvillain Vol. 2' (2019), Abstract Orchestra covered the music of the collaboration between producer Madlib and rapper MF DOOM, known as Madvillain. Abstract Orchestra released a single titled 'Air' in 2019 that included the vocal a cappella by MF DOOM.\nMitchell recounts: \"In the live set I [would] use an MPC to trigger DOOM's lyrics over the band. Last year in the final part of the mix stage I just thought wouldn't it be amazing to have DOOM on the track just like when we do it live! Dabrye released DOOM's acapella to Air and so I thought if I could get permission to use it the track would be perfect!\"\nAfter a UK tour in 2018 with Illa J, Abstract Orchestra collaborated with the brother of J Dilla, Illa J releasing the single 'New Day' (2018).\nIn the summers of 2017 and 2018 Abstract Orchestra performed at a number of UK festivals including Boomtown, Shambala, Secret Garden Party, Latitude, Green Man and Kendal Calling.\nAfter a UK tour with Hip-hop group Slum Village in 2019, Abstract Orchestra were asked by Slum Village to rework their album Fantastic, Vol. 2 the rework was released as 'Fantastic 2020 Vol. 1' (2019) and 'Fantastic 2020 Vol. 2'. \"Hip-hop with a live band, especially a big band style such as this, becomes something so much greater, taking on a new form.\"\nIn 2020 Abstract Orchestra collaborated with Young RJ (one half of Slum Village) and Mega ran on the album '2 Hands up'\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.discogs.com/artist/5859242-Abstract-Orchestra\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/4u3JZVJYDq2F3KgnUFw9dp at spotify\nhttps://music.apple.com/us/artist/abstract-orchestra/1238569094 apple"

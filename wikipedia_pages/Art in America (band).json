    "text": "Art in America is an American progressive rock band that achieved success in the early 1980s. They are best known for their self-titled song \"Art in America\" released in 1983.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe band was the first-known rock band featuring a pedal harp to appear on a major record label. Art in America was formed in 1980 by brothers Chris Flynn and Dan Flynn and sister Shishonee (real name Ruetenik). Harpist Shishonee, was formerly a member of the band The Trees Community. Joining Art in America was friend Jim Kuha. Originally called Father, the band's name was changed to 'Art in America' and under this name the group began opening for popular Irish & English pop artists such as U2 and Roxy Music. In 1983, the group released their first studio album under Sony Music/Pavilion Records. Produced by Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer producer Eddy Offord, the album contained their most popular song \"Art in America\" which received airplay on MTV music television, and radio stations throughout the United States. The songs were co-arranged by Steve Morse who also contributed a guitar solo for the song \"Undercover Lover\". The guest keyboardist on the album was Terry \"T\" Lavitz.\nIn hopes of a better deal in releasing a second album, the band moved to Los Angeles in 1985. However, the band found the pay to play gig situation in Los Angeles to be hostile and disappointing. The band still records music and loads to many internet sites for free song streaming, as well as album and singles for purchase.\nIn 2011 the band was contacted by producer David Hentschel to finally record a follow-up studio album. The album was first released in 2013, as The Hentschel Sessions and then re-released as Cloudborn with artwork and additional tracks in 2018.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nChris Flynn – Vocals, Lead guitar – Fender Stratocaster – (1974), Rickenbacker 330 12 string\nShishonee Flynn – Lyon & Healy Pedal Harp, Koto, Tamboura\nDaniel Flynn – Drums – Fibes Drums, Gamelan bell tree, percussion\nJim Kuha – Bass Rickenbacker 4001, Moog Taurus bass pedals, 12-string guitar – Ovation\nGarry Galloway – Keyboards Korg, Yamaha, Akai and Mellotron\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nArt in America (1983) No. 176 on the US Billboard 200.\nCloudborn (2018) \nArt in America – Performing live at the Royal Oak Music Theatre on March 8, 1983 Wolfgang's Vault\nArt in America – Performing live at the Capitol Theater, Flint, Michigan on May 8, 1983 King Biscuit Flower Hour\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Art in America\" (1983) No. 23 on the US Mainstream Rock charts\n\"Undercover Lover\" (1983) No. 33 on the US Mainstream Rock charts\n\n\n=== Album art ===\nThe cover for the self-titled debut (commissioned and painted by Ioannis) is featured in the book 1000 Record Covers by Michael Ochs, and published by Taschen.

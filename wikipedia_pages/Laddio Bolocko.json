    "text": "Laddio Bolocko was a noise rock band from New York City, formed in 1996 by members of Panicsville and the Dazzling Killmen. Their sound has drawn comparisons to experimental rock groups such as This Heat and Can and free jazz musicians like Albert Ayler. The band favored limited releases, offering only small pressings of their original albums. They toured internationally, recording and releasing the EP \"As if by Remote\" in Europe only.\nAfter disbanding in 2000, Armstrong and St. Ivany formed a new noise rock band, The Psychic Paramount, while Fleming and DeGrazia formed Electric Turn to Me. No Quarter Records released the anthology of Laddio Bolocko in 2003, compiling all three original releases for the first time widely available to the listening public. They were featured in a David Cross DVD entitled \"Let America Laugh.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nDrew St. Ivany – guitar\nBen Armstrong – bass\nBlake Fleming – drums\nMarcus DeGrazia – horns\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStrange Warmings of Laddio Bolocko (1997, Hungarian Records)\nIn Real Time (1998, Hungarian Records)\nAs if by Remote (1999, Hungarian Records)\nThe Life & Times of Laddio Bolocko (2003, No Quarter Records) (featuring the Super 8 film \"As if by Remote\" by Aran Tharp)\n\n\n== References =="

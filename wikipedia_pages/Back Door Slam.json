    "text": "Back Door Slam is a blues rock band started by Davy Knowles on the Isle of Man in 2003â€“04. The band got its name from a Robert Cray song of the same name. Originally a four-piece, with Castle Rushen High School friends Jamie Armstrong (bass guitar), Ross Doyle (drums) and Brian Garvey (rhythm guitar), the band was torn apart in 2004 when Garvey was killed in a car accident along with their close friend Richie Brookes.\nDeciding to carry on in Garvey's memory, Knowles, Armstrong, and Doyle reformed the band, with Knowles writing the emotional tribute to his friend & former bandmate, Stay, which was later to appear on an EP and on their debut album Roll Away. The trio recorded two EPs togethers, and played hundreds of gigs on their native Isle of Man before moving to London to live with Knowles's manager, Bob Miller (Corinne Bailey Rae, Christine Collister). After a handful of gigs in the UK, Armstrong decided to pursue a career in music production and left the band to go to University.\nIn 2007, with a spot secured at the SXSW Festival in Texas, Knowles and Doyle recruited former schoolmate Adam Jones to replace Jamie on bass. Jones joined Back Door Slam for what turned out to be two extensive tours of the US lasting until January 2009.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Debut album ===\nThe band in this classic lineup, with Ross Doyle on Drums and Adam Jones on Bass released their debut album Roll Away on 18 June 2007 in the Isle of Man, with a 1 July release date in North America. The 10 song disc (plus 1 bonus track) includes live favourites \"Come Home\" and \"Too Late\", along with evocative love song \"Too Good For Me\", newie \"It'll All Come Around\" and the one cover - 1920s blues rocker \"Outside Woman Blues\" (originally by Blind Joe Reynolds but most famously covered by Cream on their album Disraeli Gears). The album was produced by Dave Armstrong of Running Media/DAM Productions.\n\n\n=== Tour ===\nFollowing their performance at SXSW 2007, the band then played 310 dates in support of their album Roll Away. The tour included support slots with Rusted Root, REO Speedwagon, Styx, Eric Burdon, Kid Rock, and Lynyrd Skynyrd with hundreds of gigs and festivals (Lollapalooza, Download Festival, Wakarusa, Austin City Limits Festival and Bonnaroo). A live album was released of their performance at Bonnaroo. The band also toured with longtime jamband favorites Gov't Mule.\n\n\n=== Breakup ===\nOn 27 January 2009, a letter was posted on Back Door Slam's website, announcing that the band had \"broken up\" and its members were pursuing different musical endeavors.\n\n\n== Davy Knowles and Back Door Slam ==\nKnowles joined Jeff Beck as solo opening act for dates of his US Tour early 2009. He then recorded a new album, Coming Up For Air, with Peter Frampton as co-Producer, (and also adding guitar, backing vocals & co-writing two songs), along with Benmont Tench (keys), Mauricio Fritz Lewak (drums) and Kevin McCormick (bass), which was released in June 2009. He is now on the road as Davy Knowles and Back Door Slam, with PK (bass), Steven Barci (drums) and Ty Bailie (keys). They opened for Chickenfoot in August/Sept 2009. In June 2009, Chickenfoot guitarist Joe Satriani described Davy as his \"new favourite modern-day bluesman\" in a Playlist article in The Sunday Times.\nThe Outsider, Knowle's solo album, was released in March 2015.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nRoll Away (2007)\nBack Door Slam - EP (2008)\nBack Door Slam: Live from Bonnaroo (2009)\nComing Up For Air (2009)\n\n\n== External links ==\nBack Door Slam's MySpace\nDavy Knowles & Back Door Slam Official Web Page\n2011 Podcast about Back Door Slam"

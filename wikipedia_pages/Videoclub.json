    "text": "Videoclub (stylized as VIDEOCLUB) was a French musical project formed in Nantes, France, in 2018 by Ad√®le Castillon and Matthieu Reynaud. They became popular for the song \"Amour plastique\", released in September 2018.\nVideoclub released seven singles, a collaboration, and a studio album, Euphories.\nOn March 31, 2021, the duo announced their disbandment after Reynaud left the band following the deterioration of their relationship. The duo released their final single, \"SMS\", and Castillon toured under the Videoclub name as a solo act before their disbandment.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to Videoclub, Castillon was an actress and had her own YouTube channel while Reynaud learned to produce music with his father, who was a musician. \n\n\n== Musical style and influences ==\nThe group's musical style is heavily influenced by music during the 1980s but draws inspiration from contemporary music as well. Musical artists Odezenne, Superbus, Fauve, Vendredi sur Mer, Dinos, Mac DeMarco, Tame Impala, and Chromatics have been cited as sources of inspiration for the group's music; in particular, Reynaud's guitar riffs were influenced by 1980s groups such as the Cure, New Order, and Pixies. The duo have also taken inspiration from Jacques Demy films for their lyrics.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe song \"Amour plastique\" saw another resurgence in popularity on the internet, being first used on TikTok in a late September 2023 viral video. The video featured a despondent Napoleon Bonaparte saying \"There is nothing we can do,\" in response to his defeat in the Battle of Waterloo and his second exile.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

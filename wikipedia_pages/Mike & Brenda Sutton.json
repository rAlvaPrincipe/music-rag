The duo are best known for both their songwriting-production work at Motown and their own recordings in the early 1980s, including the dance song \"Don't Let Go of Me (Grip My Hips and Move Me)\" as remixed by Shep Pettibone.\nDiscovered by Stevie Wonder, both became writers and producers at Motown Records, working there from 1974 to 1979. The duo produced numerous hits at the label, most notably \"There Will Come A Day\" by Smokey Robinson, \"Stay With Me\" by Jermaine Jackson, as well as songs by the group Switch. They are the recipients of one Gold and two Platinum albums for their work.\nAfter leaving Motown they partnered with long-time friend Cheryl Lynn and wrote the Ray Parker-produced Top 5 R&B hit \"Shake It Up Tonight\". The Suttons also recorded two albums of their own, Don't Hold Back in 1982, and So Good in 1984, scoring several R&B and dance hits. They later worked with Ian Levine for his Motown revival project and recorded the track \"No Other Love\".\n\n\n== History ==\nBack in the early 1970s, Michael B.

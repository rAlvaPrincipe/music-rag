In 2015, music teacher Stacy Hogan at Coláiste Choilm in Tullamore suggested that Leaving Certificate students Jonathan Byrne and Ted Conway should enter a radio talent competition. After recruiting Ronan Bell, from a class three years below them, they began working on music. After some time, Chasing Abbey was the result of their teacher's suggestion.\nFormed in 2016, Chasing Abbey's debut single \"That Good Thing\" amassed millions of streams.

It was positively reviewed on Billboard, citing Chasing Abbey as a \"juggernaut trio from Ireland\" and \"consummate underdogs\" and describing their music as \"pop shimmer\".\nIn 2020, the release of \"Lately\" saw Chasing Abbey reach number one on the Official Homegrown charts in Ireland and number one on the Shazam charts.\n2023 saw Chasing Abbey release \"Lie\" and their hit song \"Oh My Johnny (Banks of the Roses)\".

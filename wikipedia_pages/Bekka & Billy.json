Their eponymous debut album was released by Almo Sounds in April 1997. While their debut single, \"Patient Heart,\" failed to chart in the United States, it reached No. 96 on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada.\nEntertainment Weekly gave Bekka & Billy a B rating, saying that if \"Patient Heart\" didn't become a big hit, Nashville was \"asleep at the wheel.\" AllMusic gave their album three stars, calling the duo \"tailor made for stardom.\" Vince Gill played guitar on the album, which featured a song written by Delaney Bramlett.\nThe duo went their separate ways in January 1998.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Rezzmau5 (stylized in all caps) is a Canadian electronic music supergroup composed of musicians Rezz and Deadmau5 (the latter being stylized in all lowercase). \nIn the mid-2010s, Rezz began making her own music, inspired to do so in part by Deadmau5. She later released music through his Mau5trap label and in 2021, the two released their first formal collaboration.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nDeadmau5 and Rezz are both electronic music producers from Niagara Falls, Ontario, having worked on music since the 1990s and the 2010s, respectively. The latter began DJing in her adolescence, before her experience at a deadmau5 concert inspired her to create her own music. In an interview with Vice, she stated that a main moment in her early production work was when she \"immediately jumped onto Ableton\" after viewing a Deadmau5 livestream.\nAttlas, a fellow Canadian DJ and electronic music producer, found Rezz's music and sent it to the label manager of Mau5trap, which was founded by Deadmau5. Rezz's track \"Serenity\" then appeared on We Are Friends, Vol. 4, a 2015 compilation album released by Mau5trap. She joined Mau5trap in 2016, and would release two extended plays (The Silence Is Deafening and Something Wrong Here) through the label that year. Her first two studio albums (2017's Mass Manipulation and 2018's Certain Kind of Magic) were also released through Mau5trap. Deadmau5 and Rezz performed together, alongside other Mau5trap labelmates for the label's tenth anniversary showcase, held at Toronto's Rebel venue in 2017.\nIn May 2018, a collaboration between the two was first teased when Deadmau5 shared an audio snippet on Instagram, mentioning Rezz in the post's caption. Later that September, Rezz shared that she was working on music at deadmau5's studio and shared a post of her own with the caption \"rezzmau5\".\n\n\n=== As Rezzmau5 ===\nShortly following a related NFT release, the two released their first collaborative single in April 2021, titled \"Hypnocurrency\". In January 2023, a couple months after hinting at a joint performance, the duo officially announced their first back-to-back performance under the Rezzmau5 name would be held later that August at the VELD Music Festival in Canada. \nOn 13 October, the duo released \"Infraliminal\". In the works since 2018, the single was a rework of Deadmau5's previous \"Superliminal\" from 2012. Rezz has cited the original \"Superliminal\" as the specific inspiration for beginning her music career. \"Infraliminal - Isabelle's Version\", an alternate version of the 2023 rework, was included on Rezz's 2024 album Can You See Me?.\nThey performed together again at the HiJinx event in Philadelphia, in December 2023, and later in July 2024, when the duo closed out the Freedom Stage at Tomorrowland.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nBoth Deadmau5 and Rezz are electronic music producers, with the former known for \"progressive synth work and overall immersive soundscapes\". DJ Mag Latinoam√©rica noted that Deadmau5's original \"Superliminal\" included \"signature rhythmic beats, pulsing synths, and atmospheric chords\" that were indeed revisited on \"Infraliminal\". Meanwhile, Rezz has been cited as a midtempo, and later, downtempo artist, as well as for incorporating heavy bass into her music. Karlie Powell of Your EDM wrote that the duo's \"Hypnocurrency\" balanced both artists' signature styles and featured \"eerie, hypnotic tones, and textures.\" The duo's live performances are accompanied by hypnotic-styled visual production.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Appearances together ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The New York Philomusica Chamber Ensemble is a musical ensemble founded in 1971 by A. Robert Johnson in New York City. The group presents an annual concert series of chamber music in New York City, Rockland County, and occasionally performs on tour. The ensemble owns the New York Philomusica Records label, which they use to sell albums of their music.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1971, the New York Philomusica Chamber Ensemble put on the Festival of History and Music in the hamlet of Tappan. This led to a seven-week residency at Dartmouth College in 1973, where they performed for the community of Hanover, New Hampshire.  This was followed by the ensemble's New York City Metropolitan Subscription concerts in all five boroughs of New York City from 1975–1979, and at the New York State Capitol Region Residency from 1979–1981.  The ensemble produced A Serenade to Beethoven at Sarasota Springs, Florida,     narrated by George Plimpton for television in 1982. In 1987, the ensemble was sent on a nine concert tour of Latin America by the US Department of State.\nThe ensemble’s range of programming includes the 1993 world premiere of Stravinsky’s A Soldier's Tale, with Kurt Vonnegut’s new text, the 1999 American premiere of Beethoven’s Concerto No. 4 for Piano and String Quintet, and numerous collaborations with the late jazz pianist Sir Roland Hanna.\nThe ensemble produced the first American recording of Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time, and is the first group to record the entire Mozart divertimento catalogue. The divertimento recordings were originally released by VoxBox Productions in 1975, and were followed by a release of Mozart Wind Serenades.\nNew York Philomusica Records, the ensemble's record label, was established in 1992 and has released 27 titles.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe centerpiece of the ensemble’s current activities is their annual concert series in New York City and the parallel series in nearby Rockland County, New York. The group emphasizes its Featured Composer program, which provides commissions for new works and features the work of contemporary composers. Former Featured Composers include Dr. Iain Hamilton, Jacob Druckman, and John Harbison. Michael Berkeley has been the current Featured Composer since 2005.\nIn 2008, the ensemble introduced a series of Educational Seminars which were aimed at elementary and high school students. The group occasionally performs on tour, most recently in November 2007 in Hudson, New York.\n\n\n== Common misconceptions ==\nThe New York Philomusica Chamber Ensemble is frequently confused with the New York Philharmonic, but they are not the same organization and are not in any way related.\n\n\n== 2008–2009 concert series ==\nSeptember 27, 2008: Rockland County\nOctober 2, 2008: New York, NY\nJoseph Haydn: L'isola disabitata\n\nConcert performance of Haydn opera, L’isola disabitata (The Uninhabited Island).

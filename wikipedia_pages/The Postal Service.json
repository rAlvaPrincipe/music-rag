    "text": "The Postal Service was an American indie pop group from Seattle, Washington, consisting of singer Ben Gibbard, producer Jimmy Tamborello, and Jenny Lewis on background vocals.\nThe band released their sole studio album, Give Up, in 2003 on Sub Pop Records, to mostly positive reviews. The album reached number 114 on the US Billboard 200 album chart and received platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The group decided to disband two years later, viewing attempts at a follow-up as unnecessary.\nThe band has regrouped twice for the anniversaries of Give Up, in both 2013 and 2023; each time they were accompanied by a rotating cast of support musicians, including Laura Burhenn, Jen Wood, Dave Depper and Jason McGerr.\nThe band announced that their last performance would be on September 21, 2024 at HFStival in Washington D.C.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation (2001–2003) ===\nThe group formed after Ben Gibbard contributed vocals for a song by Jimmy Tamborello called \"(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan\", from the Dntel album Life Is Full of Possibilities. The song sparked an EP of remixes of other artists, such as Lali Puna, The Flaming Lips, Safety Scissors, Barbara Morgenstern and Superpitcher, and was so well-received that the two artists decided to further collaborate. The third member of the band, Jenny Lewis, recorded vocals for several tracks before eventually becoming a full-fledged member of the band, sharing vocals and instrumentation in their live shows.\nThe band's name was chosen due to how it produced its songs. Due to conflicting schedules, Tamborello wrote and performed instrumental tracks and then sent the DATs through the mail to Gibbard, who then edited the song as he saw fit (adding his vocals along the way) and sent them back to Tamborello.  Ironically, despite the final name they chose for the project, they did not use the United States Postal Service as a courier; the CDs were sent through either FedEx or UPS.\n\n\n=== Give Up (2003–2007) ===\nThe band's debut album, Give Up, was released on February 18, 2003, on Sub Pop Records. Several songs on the album feature guest vocals from Lewis, as well as vocals from indie rock musician Jen Wood. Additionally, Gibbard's Death Cab for Cutie bandmate Chris Walla played the guitar and piano on several tracks. Although both Gibbard and Tamborello's main projects were still active at the time, The Postal Service supported the album with a successful concert tour and stated its intention to tour again in the future.\nGive Up received gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America in March 2005, and later receiving platinum certification in October 2012. The album was Sub Pop's most successful release after Nirvana's debut album, Bleach.\nThe album produced three singles, the most well-known single being \"Such Great Heights\", which was released as Give Up's lead single. The song featured in advertisements for UPS, Kaiser Permanente, and M&M's, as well as being the first theme song for ABC's Grey's Anatomy in 2005. A cover of the song by Iron & Wine was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film Garden State. It was also later covered by Amanda Palmer, Ben Folds, The Scene Aesthetic, Brack Cantrell, Streetlight Manifesto, Confide, Gareth Pearson, Joy Kills Sorrow and Postmodern Jukebox. Confide would later release a music video for their cover of \"Such Great Heights\". The second single, \"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\", was featured in the soundtrack of the 2004 film D.E.B.S. and later covered by British singer-songwriter Frank Turner. The third and final single, \"We Will Become Silhouettes\", was covered by The Shins, and the original version was featured in the trailer for the movie Funny People.\n\n\n==== United States Postal Service controversy ====\nIn August 2003, the United States Postal Service sent the band a cease and desist letter, citing the band's name as an infringement of its trademark on the phrase \"postal service\".  After negotiations, the USPS relented, allowing the band use of the trademark in exchange for promotional efforts on behalf of the USPS and a performance at its annual National Executive Conference. Additionally, at one point the USPS website sold the band's CDs. In 2007, \"Such Great Heights\" appeared in the background of the \"whiteboard\" advertising campaign for one of the federal establishment's private competitors, the United Parcel Service.\n\n\n=== Possible second album (2007–2012) ===\nOn June 22, 2007, it was revealed that The Postal Service had begun work on a new album, though the specifics of the production and the release date were vague.  Gibbard stated, \"We're slowly starting. We're crawling right now, and whether that crawl turns into a walk remains to be seen. But we'll know more towards the end of the year. I've just been touring so much and trying to find time to make it happen and make our schedules line up.\" Tamborello added, \"We're talking about wanting to finish an album by sometime next year, because we have to work with Death Cab's schedule and stuff. I definitely want to do another one.\"\nOn February 29, 2008, Spinner released an article stating that The Postal Service might not release a new album. Ben Gibbard stated, \"Jimmy and I are still throwing ideas back and forth, but as time goes on, we find ourselves busy with our own music. ... We have some stuff, but it's been difficult to find the time and the drive to do the record. I'd love to finish it at some point and maybe even do some performances. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.\" In May 2008, Gibbard stated that he and Tamborello were unlikely to release another album \"before the end of the decade.\"\nIn a December 2008 interview with Rolling Stone, Gibbard laughed off suggestions that The Postal Service's long overdue follow-up to their 2003 hit Give Up would be an indie version of the Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy, which took 15 years to produce and release. Gibbard said that both he and Tamborello do not see it as a priority in light of their main projects, Death Cab for Cutie and Dntel, respectively. He said, \"The anticipation of the second record has been a far bigger deal for everybody except the two of us... I don't know about it being the indie-rock Chinese Democracy, but now that Chinese Democracy has come out, I guess it just becomes the second Postal Service record that will never come out. There never really was a plan to do a second album. We work from time to time together but we have other things that take up all of our time.\"\nIn November 2012, Ben Gibbard posted on his Twitter account that there are \"no plans\" to produce another Postal Service record, and did not cite any specific reason for this statement, other than the fact that multiple fans questioned if there was going to be a second album.\n\n\n=== Reunion, Give Up re-issue, and disbandment (2013–2014) ===\n\nIn January 2013, The Postal Service updated its website to read \"The Postal Service 2013\", reigniting speculation that the band would play shows, or possibly release a new album. It was later confirmed that the image on the band's site portended that the band's debut, Give Up, would receive a 10th-anniversary re-issue featuring a 15-song disc of rarities, including two new songs with Jenny Lewis to be released on April 9, 2013. The following month, The Postal Service announced it would officially reunite for an extended world tour with venues including Red Rocks Amphitheatre, the 2013 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April, Sasquatch! Music Festival in Washington in May, the Primavera Sound Festival 2013 in Barcelona, and Free Press Summer Fest in Houston, Texas in June.\nAlong with the reunion, the band released their first new track in ten years called \"A Tattered Line of String\" featuring Jenny Lewis. On March 21, the band released a second new track titled \"Turn Around\", released through 107.7 The End.\nAs a tie-in to the Give Up reissue, comedy website Funny or Die posted a parody video directed by Tom Scharpling set in 2002 titled \"The Postal Service Auditions\", in which Jimmy Tamborello holds auditions for his musical collaborator. Guest stars on the video include \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, Moby, Duff McKagan, Tom DeLonge, Aimee Mann, Jon Wurster, Page Hamilton, Nate Mendel, and Marc Maron.\nOn August 3, 2013, Ben Gibbard announced on Twitter that the Lollapalooza after-show would be the last Postal Service performance ever, and that the band would formally disband permanently after the show, finally quashing rumors of a highly anticipated second album. The band played their last live show at the Metro Chicago on August 5, 2013.\nAs an end punctuation mark to their career, The Postal Service released the feature-length documentary concert film Everything Will Change on October 7, 2014, filmed during their two performances at the Greek Theater in Berkeley, CA, July 26–27, 2013. Directed by Justin Mitchell, the film intersperses backstage tapes and interviews with complete footage of the concert itself.\n\n\n=== Subsequent collaborations, releases and Everything Will Change (2014–2022) ===\nJimmy Tamborello produced a remix of Death Cab for Cutie's 2018 song \"Summer Years\".\nJenny Lewis toured with Death Cab for Cutie in the summer of 2019, in support of their On the Line and Thank You for Today albums, respectively.  On select dates, Gibbard invited Lewis to join DCFC for their set's encore, and DCFC played \"Nothing Better\", with Gibbard and Lewis doing the vocals from the original song.\nBen Gibbard performed \"Such Great Heights\" solo on August 17, 2020, online for the virtual 2020 Democratic National Convention.\nOn October 6, 2020, The Postal Service created new social media accounts for the band and teased an announcement for the following day, sparking speculation about new music. The announcement was a mock video conference featuring Gibbard, Tamborello, and Lewis along with several musicians and celebrities urging people in the United States to vote in the November election, done in the style of 2013's \"The Postal Service Auditions\".\nOn December 4, 2020, The Postal Service released the live album Everything Will Change via Sub Pop Records, featuring the complete live recordings from the documentary/concert film released in 2014, remastered and available in audio format for the first time. Live tracks \"Natural Anthem\" and \"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\" from the album were released as digital singles on November 22, 2020.\n\n\n=== Give Up 20th Anniversary Tour (2023–2024) ===\nOn December 8, 2022, The Postal Service announced they would embark on a reunion tour, co-headlining with Death Cab for Cutie, beginning in late summer 2023. The Postal Service announced they would be performing Give Up in its entirety, while Death Cab for Cutie would be performing Transatlanticism in its entirety, in celebration of the 20th anniversaries of both albums. The tour originally consisted of 17 shows. However, due to high demand many more additional shows were added, with the tour lasting into September 2024.\nIn August 2024, ahead of the band's UK and European leg of the tour, Gibbard reflected on whether there could be a second The Postal Service album, noting: \"I think the main reason that a second Postal Service record has never come to fruition – and will never come to fruition – the time commitments that Death Cab ended up taking, which really started with Transatlanticism, haven’t really ever let up. There’s just not enough time, let alone creative juices flowing, to make a suitable follow-up [to Give Up]. I think anything that we would attempt to make at this point would be thoroughly disappointing. The stakes are just lower [in Death Cab] when you’re putting an album out every two to three years. If people don’t like this one, there’ll be another one later. But after 20 years, there is no way we could ever follow that up in a way that would be satisfying to people. I would rather have all my focus on Death Cab than be watering both projects down. I just don’t have the capacity to do both. Some might argue I barely have the capacity to do one!\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nBenjamin Gibbard – lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, drums (2001–2005, 2013, 2023–2024)\nJimmy Tamborello – production, keyboards, electronic percussion, programming, accordion (2001–2005, 2013, 2023–2024)\nJenny Lewis – backing and lead vocals, keyboards, guitar, sampling (2002–2005, 2013, 2023–2024)\n\n\n=== Touring musicians ===\nLaura Burhenn – keyboards, backing vocals (2013)\nDave Depper – keyboards, backing vocals (2023–2024)\nJason McGerr – drums (2023–2024 - \"Brand New Colony\" and \"Natural Anthem\")\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Other appearances ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\"A Tattered Line of String\"\n\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\"\n\"Such Great Heights\"\n\"We Will Become Silhouettes\"\n\n\n=== Remix work ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nThe Postal Service page at Sub Pop Records\nThe Postal Service discography at Discogs"

    "text": "Kitten is an American alternative rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 2009. It is fronted by vocalist Chloe Chaidez, who founded the band and has been its sole consistent member since its inception. The band is currently based in Los Angeles. Its current members, in addition to Chaidez, are guitarists Dave Stagno and Parker Silzer IV, and keyboardist Max Tsiring.\nKitten had previously been signed to Warner Music Group labels Atlantic and Elektra Records. Since 2018, their music has been distributed through Sony Music divisions including RED Music, Another Century, and The Orchard. Their debut album Kitten was released in 2014 through Elektra. They have also released six extended plays: Sunday School (2010), Cut It Out (2012), Like a Stranger (2013), Heaven or Somewhere in Between (2016), Pink Champagne (2018), and Goodbye Honeymoon Phase (2019). Their second studio album is scheduled for release in 2021.\nKitten are known for their 80s-inspired sound and energetic live shows.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2009–12: Formation, Sunday School & Cut It Out ===\nKitten was formed in 2009. Front woman Chloe Chaidez formed the band after meeting producer Chad Anderson, with whom she developed a professional relationship. Anderson would become the manager of Kitten, and contribute as a producer and songwriter for the band. Kitten's first guitarist, Max Ratzky, introduced Chaidez to the other musicians who would join Kitten's original line-up. These fellow founding members were drummer Max Kuehn, keyboardist Elvis Kuehn, and guitarist Andy Miller. Ratzky left Kitten in 2009; prior to the release of their debut extended play, which the band had begun working on that year.\nIn 2010, Kitten were signed to Atlantic Records, and bassist Zac Carper joined the band. Various demos were shared by the band in the lead-up to their upcoming EP, such as \"We Did It Anyway\", \"Don't Kill the Light\", and \"Johnny Johnny Johnny\". The final version of \"Don't Kill the Light\", renamed \"Kill the Light\", was shared as a free download in March 2010. Kitten's debut extended play, Sunday School, was released in October 2010. The following November, the track \"Kill the Light\" was released as a single on 7\" vinyl.\nIn December 2010, Kitten began working on a planned full-length album. By early 2011, they had recruited bassist Chris Vogel as a new band member. The band ultimately decided to release five of their new songs as an extended play; planning to combine EP tracks and other new material into an album later on.\nKitten recorded a cover of \"Panic\" by The Smiths in 2011, which they contributed to the tribute album Please Please Please: A Tribute to The Smiths.\nTo promote their upcoming EP, the band released two singles in 2012: the double single \"Cut It Out\" / \"Sugar\" in May, and \"Japanese Eyes\" in July. The EP, titled Cut It Out, was released on August 28, 2012 through Atlantic Records. Chaidez described its sound as being more electronic, while still containing the \"rock element\" of their previous EP. The new sound was the result of Chaidez experimenting with electronic music production using Ableton, and the influence of 80s new wave music.\nFollowing the release of Cut It Out, Kitten went through major lineup changes. Band members Max Kuehn, Elvis Kuehn, and Zac Carper left Kitten to focus on their other band, FIDLAR. Later in 2012, Kitten recruited three new members—drummer Lukas Frank, keyboardist Bryan DeLeon, and guitarist Waylon Rector—and Andy Miller and Chris Vogel left the band. By early 2013, Kitten had also gained a new bassist, Zach Bilson.\n\n\n=== 2013–15: Like a Stranger, MXTP & Kitten ===\nIn February 2013, Kitten shared a new song titled \"Yesterday (What's Love)\". The following August, they shared the track \"Like a Stranger\" to promote their upcoming extended play of the same name. They revealed at the same time that their debut album was scheduled for 2014. The Like a Stranger EP was released on August 27, 2013 through Elektra Records.\n\nLater in 2013, following the release of Like a Stranger, band members Waylon Rector, Lukas Frank, Zach Bilson, and Bryan DeLeon chose to leave Kitten. In February 2014, Rector, Bilson, and DeLeon rejoined the band, joining Chaidez on tour supporting The Neighbourhood.\nKitten premiered a new track, \"Money\", along with its music video in February 2014. The video stars musician Ariel Pink. Chaidez stated that, while recording their debut album, the band had ideas for music that did not fit the album's sound. They decided to release some of these tracks, including \"Money\", as a separate project. According to Chaidez, the songs were inspired by \"old Missy Elliot, Arca, Drake, Future, Yeezus, etc.\" This project emerged as a seven-track mixtape titled MXTP, which was released on May 13, 2014. It was available to stream exclusively via Beats Music. That same month, Rector, Bilson, and DeLeon left the band again, leaving Chaidez as the sole remaining member of Kitten.\nKitten's eponymous debut album, Kitten, was released on June 24, 2014 by Elektra Records. It is composed both of new music and songs from the band's earlier extended plays. The album was preceded by two singles: \"Why I Wait\" and \"G#\"; the latter originally appeared on Kitten's 2012 EP Cut It Out. To celebrate the album's release, Kitten held a record release party at El Rey Theatre, Los Angeles. This show commenced the band's first headlining tour, which included dates in the United States and Canada.\nIn March 2015, Kitten shared a new track titled \"Big Dope Baby\" via SoundCloud. The song saw Chaidez experiment with a more punk sound. Also in 2015, Kitten sold a compilation CD titled Diamonds on tour. It included various songs from their earlier releases, as well as four previously unreleased tracks (\"Michael\", \"Catholic Boyz\", \"Hot Rod\", and \"Running Away\") and new remixes of the songs \"Sugar\" and \"Like a Stranger\".\n\n\n=== 2016–2018: Heaven or Somewhere in Between & Pink Champagne ===\nAs of 2016, Kitten had left Elektra Records, opting to go independent. In January 2016, the band released a new single, \"Fall on Me\", and announced an upcoming EP titled Heaven or Somewhere in Between. The EP was released independently on March 4, 2016. It largely focuses on spiritual themes; according to Chaidez, \"a lot of the lyrics have to do with the relationship between you and whatever your God is and how that plays out into your life\". Chaidez worked on the songs with a new collaborator, Dave Stagno, as well as a long-time collaborator, producer Chad Anderson. Stagno played keyboards on the EP, but would go on to join Kitten as a guitarist. Heaven or Somewhere in Between was ranked seventeenth in Rolling Stone's list of \"20 Best Pop Albums of 2016\". In July 2016, Kitten released a new single titled \"Steal the Night\". The song appears as a bonus track on the vinyl release of Heaven or Somewhere in Between, along with a \"piano version\" of \"Fall on Me\".\nIn August 2016, Kitten began a crowdfunding campaign through the website PledgeMusic to fund their planned second album. The band shared two new songs in February 2017: \"No Hallelujah\" and \"Oh My God\". Both songs were made available to download via PledgeMusic, exclusively for \"Pledgers\".\nIn 2017–2018, Kitten gained several new members to their lineup. Guitarist Parker Silzer IV and keyboardist Max Tsiring joined the band in January 2017, after being introduced to Chaidez by Stagno. The following September, Kitten reconnected with musician Blu DeTiger—who had opened for the band in 2015—on the set of the music video for \"Phases\" by Alma and French Montana. Kitten also met DeTiger's brother Rex on the set. Blu and Rex DeTiger soon joined Kitten as the band's touring bassist and touring drummer, respectively.\nIn November 2017, Kitten shared a live recording of a new song titled \"Strange Embrace\". The following February, they released a new single, \"I Did It!\", to promote an upcoming project. The studio version of \"Strange Embrace\" was released as the second single from the project in May 2018. On June 1, 2018, Kitten released their fifth extended play, Pink Champagne. It is their first project to be entirely self-produced by the band. Its lyrics, according to Chaidez, \"mostly deal with personal relationships and mostly from a position of newfound strength\".\nIn August 2018, Kitten released a new single titled \"Secrets\", along with its B-side \"Mercury\". \"Mercury\" was written about Chaidez' parents' divorce. A new version of their song \"Oh My God\" was released as a single in October 2018.\n\n\n=== 2019–2020: Pride Month covers, Goodbye Honeymoon Phase & second studio album ===\nIn June 2019, Kitten announced that they would be covering a song by an LGBT musician each week of Pride Month. The covers, which were shared via PAPER Magazine, included \"Your Song\" by Elton John, \"It's My Party\" by Lesley Gore, and \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\" by Culture Club.\nOn August 15, 2019, Kitten shared a new song, \"Memphis\", and announced an upcoming extended play. The title of the EP was initially revealed to be Honeymoon Phase, but it was later renamed Goodbye Honeymoon Phase. The day after its premiere, \"Memphis\" was officially released as a single, and its music video was shared. The EP's title track was released as the second single on September 20, 2019; Chaidez described its sound as \"Avril Lavigne meets PC Music\". On October 11, Kitten revealed the album cover and track listing of the extended play. Goodbye Honeymoon Phase was released on October 18, 2019. On the same day, the band shared the music video for the EP track \"Me\".\nKitten made an appearance on the first season of the Netflix original series I'm with the Band: Nasty Cherry, which was released in November 2019. The docuseries is about the formation of the girl band Nasty Cherry, for which Kitten's Chloe Chaidez plays guitar.\nAn acoustic version of \"Memphis\" was released by Kitten in February 2020. In May 2020, the band released a new single titled \"My House\".\nOn October 28, 2020, Kitten released the song \"Angelina\". It is the lead single from their upcoming second studio album, which is scheduled for release in 2021 through Sony Music subsidiary The Orchard. The song's title alludes to actress Angelina Jolie, as well as Los Angeles, where the band is based. A music video for the track was released the following day, and was directed by Chloe Chaidez's mother Natalie Chaidez. A further four singles have since been released to promote the band's second album: \"What Year Are We In\" in November 2020, \"Daddy Don't Take My Phone\" in December 2020, \"Do U Still Love Me?\" in January 2021, and \"American Football\" in February 2021.\n\n\n== Style and influences ==\n\nMusic reporters and critics have frequently likened Kitten's work to music from the 1980s. Throughout their career they have been referred to as an alternative/indie rock and new wave band. Kitten have also pursued a more pop-influenced direction, particularly since their EP Heaven or Somewhere in Between. Chloe Chaidez has stated, though, that \"Kitten will always be a rock band\".\nKitten are known for their energetic stage presence during live performances. Chaidez, who has a background in gymnastics, incorporates acrobatics into the band's performances; for example, climbing up and jumping off of high surfaces.\nChaidez's decision to pursue music was influenced by her father Mike Chaidez, who was the drummer in East Los Angeles punk band Thee Undertakers, and who taught her to play bass. Throughout her career with Kitten, Chaidez has named acts including Ian Curtis, Karen O, Cat Power, Prince, David Bowie, My Bloody Valentine, The Stone Roses, Conor Oberst, Pulp, Suede, Annie Lennox, and Bryan Ferry as influences. The band cited The Go-Go's, The Motels, and Siouxsie and the Banshees as inspirations for their 2018 extended play Pink Champagne.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\n\nChloe Chaidez – vocals, guitar (2009–present)\nDave Stagno – guitar (2016–present); keyboards (2016–2017)\nParker Silzer IV – guitar (2017–present)\nMax Tsiring – keyboards (2017–present)\nFormer members\n\nMax Ratzky (AKA Max Harrison) – guitar (2009)\nMax Kuehn – drums (2009–2012)\nElvis Kuehn – keyboards (2009–2012)\nAndy Miller – guitar (2009–2012)\nZac Carper – bass guitar (2010–2012)\nChris Vogel – bass guitar (2011–2012)\nLukas Frank – drums (2012–2013)\nBryan DeLeon – keyboards (2012–2013, 2014)\nWaylon Rector – guitar (2012–2013, 2014)\nZach Bilson – bass guitar (2013, 2014)\nBlu DeTiger – bass guitar (2017–2019)\nRex DeTiger – drums (2017-2019)\nFormer touring musicians\n\nNicolas Perez – guitar (circa 2014–2017)\nOmar Ahmed – bass guitar (circa 2014–2017)\nKameron Waters – drums (circa 2014–2016)\nRonnie Lanzilotta – bass guitar (circa 2016)\nBlu DeTiger – bass guitar (2017–2019)\nRex DeTiger – drums (2017-2019)\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nKitten (2014)\nPersonal Hotspots (2021)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\n\n=== Headlining ===\nSummer Tour (2014) (United States and Canada)\nKitten 2K15 (2015) (United States and England)\nHeaven or Somewhere in Between Tour (2016) (United States)\nSteal the Night Tour (2016) (United States)\nEast Coast Tour (2017) (United States)\nI Did It!

Their debut studio album No Bad Days was released in May 2014 through Warner Music. It has been hailed one of the greatest musical sensations of 2014 by the Polish media, receiving an exclusive Fryderyk award for phonographic debut of the year.\n\n\n== History ==\nJustyna Święs and Kuba Karaś first met in 2011 at a song competition and decided to start playing together. Initially, they were playing indie rock acoustic songs, but then decided to go in a more electronic direction. During the Summer 2013, they composed several songs and mailed them to Łukasz Jakóbiak who has a popular Internet talk-show 20m2 Łukasza.  The band became an Internet phenomenon, and in November 2013 they began their first sold-out tour, playing concerts in clubs in Poland.\nIn January 2014, they entered a studio owned by music producer Bartosz Szczęsny and recorded songs for their debut album. The Dumplings were signed to Warner Music Poland in February 2014. Their debut studio album No Bad Days, produced by Szczęsny, was released on 13 May 2014 through Warner Music.\nThey performed at Open'er Festival in July, and at Off Festival in August 2014.\nTheir second studio album Sea You Later, produced by popular Polish drummer and hip-hop producer Piotr \"Emade\" Waglewski, was released on 13 November 2015. A concert tour to promote the album started on 6 November in Opole and will end on 6 December in London.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Papa Grows Funk is an American funk band from New Orleans, Louisiana. The band was started by frontman John \"Papa\" Gros in early 2000, developing from a series of Monday night jam sessions helmed by Gros at New Orleansâ€™ Maple Leaf Bar. Gros would invite some friends down to play, and the impromptu jams became a common bond for a handful of musicians, including guitarist June Yamagishi, sax player Jason Mingledorf, bassist Marc Pero and drummer Jeffery \"Jellybean\" Alexander, who now make up Papa Grows Funk.\nThey played in front of a hometown crowd at The Voodoo Experience held at City Park in New Orleans over Halloween weekend 2009.\n\n\n== Hiatus ==\nIt has been widely reported that the band has been on \"indefinite hiatus\" since June 29, 2013.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nDoin' It (2001)\nShakin' (2003)\nLive at the Leaf (2006)\nMr. Patterson's Hat (2007)\nNeedle in the Groove (2012)\nThe Last Leaf (Live) (2016)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPapa Grows Funk | Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos"

The trio later went on to form the group OuterSpace. The group originally started to form in the early 1990s and eventually led to an alliance with fellow Philadelphians Jedi Mind Tricks and their label Superegular Recordings. In 1998, Superegular released their debut single \"We Lyve\". OuterSpace appeared on several Jedi Mind Trick tracks and in 1999 the Illegaliens EP was released in on the Wordsound label. Soon thereafter, OuterSpace hooked up with DJ Sat-One and began recording with Jazzy Jeff's production company A Touch of Jazz. This collaboration proved useful with the release of the SAT ONE produced Danger Zone 12\" on Soulspazm Records.\n\n\n=== OuterSpace and Blood and Ashes (2000-2004) ===\nOuterSpace appeared on Jedi Mind Tricks' albums through the early 2000s and became a part of Paz's supergroup Army of the Pharaohs.

An Army of the Pharaohs collaboration album was rumoured to be in the works for years, but was often delayed due to separate projects and internal problems, however a mixtape titled The Bonus Papers was released shortly after the release of the album because it was thought some songs didn't fit the artistic design of the album while others were known to have been extremely political and were possibly held back to reduce controversy.

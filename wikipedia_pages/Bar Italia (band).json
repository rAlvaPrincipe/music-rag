    "text": "Bar Italia, stylized in lowercase, are a British indie rock band formed in London in 2019. The band consists of members Nina Cristante (vocals), Sam Fenton (vocals, guitar), and Jezmi Tarik Fehmi (vocals, guitar). Their name is derived from the Soho café Bar Italia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe Italian-born Cristante grew up in Rome but moved to London in 2007. Fenton and Fehmi lived in a flat below Cristante in Peckham, where they met. In 2019, they began making music together.\nFrom 2020 onwards, the band released four albums, three EPs and multiple singles through World Music, the record label founded by London musicians Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland.\nThey were noted as a \"new act to watch\" by The Face magazine and the number one \"rising star to look out for in 2023\" by The Times. Their 2022 EP CDR was placed at number one on Gorilla vs. Bear's list of the best EPs of 2022, and their track \"Miracle Crush\" was placed at number 13 on Crack's list of the 25 best songs of 2022.\nIn March 2023, it was announced they had signed with Matador Records. They released Tracey Denim in May 2023, while their second album of the year, The Twits, released in November and was supported by European and North American tour dates. Both albums received \"generally favorable\" reviews according to rating aggregator Metacritic, with French cultural magazine Les Inrocks placing the two projects collectively at number 10 in their list of the best albums of the year. Allmusic called The Twits a reflection of the group's growth \"into an increasingly singular, expressive band\", and the record debuted at No. 36 on the UK Albums Chart, the band's highest placement as of 2023.\n\n\n== Other projects ==\nFehmi and Fenton also make music as a duo under the name Double Virgo, a reference to their shared astrological star sign. Since 2020, they have created a number of indie rock and shoegaze records together, produced by Vegyn and released via his label, PLZ Make It Ruins.\nNina Cristante has created lo-fi pop music under the alias Nina (stylized NINA), often collaborating with producer and former label mate, Dean Blunt.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\n\nNina Cristante  – vocals (2020–present)\nSam Fenton  – vocals, guitar (2020–present)\nJezmi Tarik Fehmi  – vocals, guitar (2020–present)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nQuarrel (World Music, 2020)\nBedhead (World Music, 2021)\nTracey Denim (Matador, 2023)\nThe Twits (Matador, 2023)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nAngelica Pilled (World Music, 2020)\nCDR (self-released, 2022)\nThe Tw*ts (Matador, 2024)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References =="

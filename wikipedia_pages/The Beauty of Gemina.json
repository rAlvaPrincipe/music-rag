    "text": "The Beauty of Gemina is a Swiss electronic/alternative rock band founded by Michael Sele in 2006.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Beauty of Gemina was started after the dissolution of Michael Sele's old band, Nuuk. On their debut album, the song \"Suicide Landscape\" became a number one hit on the World Gothic Charts. For this song, a video was shot at the San Bernardino Pass which was played on VIVA (MTV Europe) and put into rotation on Schweizer Fernsehen.\nIn the spring of 2008, they were the supporting act for The Smashing Pumpkins in the Zurich Hallenstadion. In May, they played at Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig.\nAfter a tour with the German rock band ASP and some concerts in England, they completed their second album A Stranger to Tears. It was released in Switzerland under their own label tBoG Music, and in Austria and Germany with Danse Macabre Records, the label of Bruno Kramm of Das Ich. The video for the song \"This Time\" was again aired on VIVA Switzerland and Schweizer Fernsehen. The album hit number three on the Deutsche Alternative Charts.  In both 2011 and 2012, they were in Hildesheim to play at the M'era Luna festival.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe band mixes elements from electronic rock, dark rock, metal and electronic music.\nClassical elements are integrated into many songs, thus one finds a sample from a Mozart composition in \"Victims of Love\" from their first album. Influences include techno/trance (\"Victims of Love\", \"Shadow Dancer\" and \"Galilee Song\") and gothic rock/dark wave (guitar on \"This Time\") that could already be seen in Michael Sele's predecessor band Nuuk.\nFor their third album At The End Of The Sea, The Beauty of Gemina added more guitars to the foreground, including new wave and post-punk sounds of the 1980s (for example, in \"Obscura\", \"Rumours\" and \"Narcotica\") and alternative rock riffs from the 1990s in such songs as \"Black Cat Nights\" and \"Counting Tears\". However, their music still features the fusion of different genres of rock and electronic dance music. For instance, \"King's Men Come\", \"Narcotica\" and \"La Mer â€“ Rythme Eternel\" have breakbeat and trip hop rhythms, while \"In Silence\" features a typical techno beat from a Roland TR-909 bass drum.\nWhen the band released Iscariot Blues in 2012, the album saw a shift in musical style that would later be developed on subsequent releases. This album saw an increased reliance on acoustic guitar and a sparser, lighter atmosphere. Songs such as \"Stairs\" and \"Badlands\" fused elements of folk and blues to their established sound, and Michael Sele's arrangements began to mature. This diverse approach was fully realised on 2016's Minor Sun, which drew on every facet of the band's sound. 2018's Flying With the Owl pushed the band further from its roots into semi-acoustic territory.\nThe band's next album, Skeleton Dreams, was released on 4 September 2020. The album was met with acclaim, and reintroduced more electric instrumentation largely absent from the previous release. Michael Sele performed a selection of material acoustically for a live-streamed studio session in November 2020. The session was released on vinyl in 2021.\nFollowing delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band embarked on a European tour for Skeleton Dreams in 2022, followed by the XV: 15 Years Anniversary Tour into 2023. The anniversary tour saw the reintroduction of earlier material into their live sets.\nIn February 2023, the band released the single \"When the Night Is Back In Me\" - its first new material in over two years, marking the longest gap between recorded works. Another new recording - a reimagining of \"One Step to Heaven\" from Diary of a Lost - was released in March 2023. The band performed live at the HR Giger Museum in June 2023, as part of the museums 25th anniversary celebrations.\nIn October, the band announced a new album; Songs of Homecoming. Tour dates were announced for late summer 2024.\n\n\n== Lyrics ==\nMichael Sele's lyrics deal with issues such as suicide, depression, loneliness and heartache. He has also criticized the Catholic Church, specifically by releasing the songs \"Victims of Love\" and \"Galilee Song\" as free downloads during Easter 2009. A significant feature of most songs by The Beauty of Gemina is the amount of repetition in the text. Songs with the traditional style of verse and chorus are rare.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nDiary of a Lost (2006)\nA Stranger to Tears (2008)\nAt the End of the Sea (2010)\nIscariot Blues (2012)\nThe Myrrh Sessions (2013)\nGhost Prayers (2014)\nMinor Sun (2016)\nFlying with the Owl (2018)\nSkeleton Dreams (2020)\nSongs of Homecoming (2024)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nLive at Moods - A Dark Acoustic Night (2015)\nMinor Sun - Live in Zurich (2017)\nMichael Sele - Studio Live Session (2021)\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\nPictures of a Lost (2006)\nLive at Moods - A Dark Acoustic Night (2015)\nMinor Sun - Live in Zurich (2017)\nDiscography taken from The Beauty of Gemina webpage.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nInternational Official Fanbase\nThe Beauty of Gemina at discogs.com\nMichael Sele talks about At the End of the Sea (in German)"

An EP, Alive from Legacy (2018), provided three live tracks and they then represented South Florida in the 2018 International Blues Challenge in Memphis. The outfit performed more than 300 shows in two years, appearing nationally across the United States.\nTheir sophomore release, Tales from the West, was released in late 2018, was nominated in three categories for an Independent Blues Music Award, for 'Best Modern Roots Band', 'Best New Artist', and 'Best Modern Roots CD'. The album debuted at number 20 on the Roots Music Report Blues Rock Chart. The album contained nine original numbers and a couple of versions of other's material including Junior Kimbrough's \"I Gotta Try You Girl\".  However one reviewer noted \"I can't say that any of the songs really represent the blues. This is hard rock with a Frank Zappa cover that gets way, way into the metal genre\". Shaw Davis & the Black Ties were cited as one of the \"Top 50 Rock & Blues Artists You Must Hear In 2019\" by Rock & Blues Muse. In support of their album, the band undertook their 'Tales From The West Tour' in mid-2019, sharing the stage with Samantha Fish, Chris Duarte, Mike Zito, Albert Castiglia, G. E. Smith and Anthony Gomes.\nA new single was released by the trio on March 12, 2021, on Chin Music Records and distributed by Sony Orchard.  \"Higher\" was taken from their then-upcoming album, Red Sun Rebellion.

The album comprised nine tracks, including the trio's take on the blues standard, \"Rock Me Baby\".\nThe trio's touring schedule has seen them perform alongside Blackberry Smoke, Walter Trout, Eric Tessmer, Samantha Fish and Anthony Gomes.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nShaw Davis : Guitar, vocals\nGreg Riordan: Bass, vocals\nBobby Van Stone : Drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

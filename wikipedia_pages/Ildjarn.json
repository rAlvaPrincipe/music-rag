    "text": "Ildjarn was a Norwegian black metal project that formed in 1991. Ildjarn recorded music until 1997 but did not officially end until 2005. The man behind Ildjarn was Vidar Våer, although some releases were collaborations with a musician known as Nidhogg.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 1991. The band's music was a very raw, fast, simple and lo-fi brand of black metal, with most songs composed of basic drum patterns, a couple of riffs, and unintelligible vocals. The band's style has been compared to hardcore punk in its simplistic ferocity and short song lengths. Two Ildjarn albums were made entirely on a synthesizer. Of all the released music, the only Ildjarn song to have its lyrics published was \"Eksistensens Jeger\", from the self-titled compilationIldjarn-Nidhogg in 2003.\nIn 2006, the band website stated that no more news would be printed, leading to the conclusion that Ildjarn had ended. The title of Ildjarn's 2005 release, Ildjarn is Dead, further supports this conclusion.  Part of Vidar Våer's motivation for ending Ildjarn was due to his 4-track recorder breaking (the same 4-track recorder used during Emperor's early days as Thou Shalt Suffer). \nIldjarn never had or shared any political affiliations, messages or themes, but the artist supported veganism in interviews. However, in the Final Statement Vidar issued in 2005, he stated: \"(...) I don’t wish to comment any more on subhumans such as gay human males. They are the lowest of the low, like retards, Congoids (...)\"\n\n\n== Related projects ==\nThe related band Sort Vokter consisted of Ildjarn, Nidhogg and two other members known as Tvigygre and Heiinghund.

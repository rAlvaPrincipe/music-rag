During an interview with New York Post Kelly Rowland stated \"I felt like there was a void for a girls group in the music industry and this is something that I have wanted to do since Destiny's Child's Destiny Fulfilled tour. There were so many girl groups back in the day and now there is only one,\" she continues, referring to Fifth Harmony. \"I want to show that women can get back to making money together.\"\nRowland held auditions for the girl group in three cities, narrowed down from 600 girls to 15 and later choosing the final five consisting(particularly order) Gabrielle \"Gabby\" Carreiro, Kristal Lyn Smith (originally from the girl group RichGirl), Ashly Williams, Brienna DeVlugt and Shyann Roberts.

    "text": "Da Internz are an American music production team originating from Chicago and currently based in Los Angeles. The duo is composed of Marcos \"Kosine\" Palacios and Ernest Tuo Clark. Da Internz describe their sound as \"gourmet ratchet\", meaning imperfect but excellent.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBoth men state that they were born to make music. Marcos’ mother started him in piano tuition at six years old. He picked up the saxophone in 5th grade and the drums in 8th grade.\nThe team came together in 2004 when Palacios was a student at Columbia College Chicago and Clark was working for Conquer Records in management and A&R. Upon graduation in 2006, Palacios was hired at Columbia as a professor of hip-hop beat making. He held this position for two and a half years.\nThe team has worked in several genres including hip-hop, pop and neo soul. They had their first major break in 2009 with Mims’ sophomore album, Guilt. The two served as co-executive producers for the project, where they had seven songs. The album’s first single, \"Move (If You Wanna)\", was released in 2008. Da Internz received ASCAP awards in 2013 for producing \"Dance (Ass)\" by Big Sean and \"Birthday Cake\" by Rihanna, two of their biggest songs. In addition to the ASCAP awards, Da Internz has had several Grammy nominations. My World 2.0 received a Grammy nomination for best pop vocal album in 2011. Life Is Good, by Nas, received a Grammy nomination for best rap album. Tamar Braxton's Love And War earned a Grammy nomination for best urban contemporary album. Love in the Future by John Legend was also Grammy nominated for best R&B album. Lastly, \"Anaconda\" by Nicki Minaj was nominated for best rap song for the 2015 Grammy awards.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nThey cite Prince, Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones, Gerald Albright, Donny Hathaway, Ella Fitzgerald, Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderley, Charles Mingus and Michael Jackson as musical influences. They are also avid readers, citing Myles Munroe and Malcolm Gladwell as among their favorite authors.\n\n\n== Production discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2009: \"Move (If You Wanna)\" (MIMS)\n2010: \"Waiting Outside the Lines\" (Greyson Chance)\n2011: \"Benefit of a Fool\" (Boyz II Men)\n2011: \"Birthday Cake\" (Rihanna) \n2011: \"Dance (A$$)\" (Big Sean)\n2012: \"The Don\" (Nas)\n2012: \"Marry Go Round\" (Nelly featuring Chris Brown)\n2012: \"Mona Lisa\" (Big Sean)\n2012: \"88\" (Diggy Simmons)\n2013: \"I Would\" (Justin Bieber)\n2013: \"Paradise\" (Cassie featuring Wiz Khalifa)\n2014: \"Anaconda\" (Nicki Minaj)\n2014: \"Good Lovin\" (Ludacris)\n2015: \"If I Don't Have You\" (Tamar Braxton)\n\n\n=== 2009 ===\n\n\n==== Mims - Guilt ====\n02. \"The Skit\"\n03. \"On & On\"\n04. \"Love Rollercoaster\" (feat.

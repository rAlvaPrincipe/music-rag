    "text": "Bingo Players is a Dutch dance and electro house musical project fronted by DJ and record producer Maarten Hoogstraten (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈmaːrtə(n) ˈɦoːxstraːtə(n)]). Bingo Players was originally a duo, which included Paul Bäumer, who died from cancer in 2013. After the death of Bäumer, Hoogstraten announced that Bäumer had wished for him to continue under the Bingo Players name. They are best known for their songs \"Cry (Just a Little)\" and \"Rattle\". \"Cry (Just a Little)\" was a top-40 hit in the Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom and other parts of Europe and Australia. Bingo Players were ranked number 52 in DJ Mag's Top 100 DJs list for 2013.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe Bingo Players was founded by Dutch DJs Maarten Hoogstraten and Paul Bäumer, in 2006.\nIn addition to DJing and producing, Bingo Players own and operate Hysteria Records. The label releases many of the Bingo Players' singles in addition to tracks from other electro house producers.\nIn May 2011, the Bingo Players released \"Cry (Just a Little)\". In the same year, the Bingo Players had a hit with their original record \"Rattle\". The song charted in the top 40 in the Netherlands, France, Sweden and Denmark.\nIn 2013, a revamped version of \"Rattle\" titled \"Get Up (Rattle)\" was released and became a number one single in the United Kingdom in addition to being a top 10 hit in Germany, Austria, France, Australia and other parts of Europe. The single has been certified gold in Canada, silver in the UK, and four times platinum in Australia.\nOn 19 July 2013, Bäumer announced on the duo's Facebook page that he was diagnosed with cancer and that Hoogstraten would be representing the duo on the road for the remaining tour. Bäumer stated he would still be working in the studio as well as taking lead in running Hysteria Records, while seeking medical treatment.\nOn 17 December 2013, Bäumer died after having cancer for over a year. Hoogstraten announced the news on Facebook on December 18. He had cancelled all upcoming shows to take time off to mourn the loss with his family and friends as well as attending the funeral.\nIn early 2014, Bingo Players announced that Hoogstraten would be continuing on as a solo act, as per Bäumer's wishes. Around the same time, the Bingo Players released \"Knock You Out\", which became the group's first number one song on the US dance chart.\nThe Bingo Players appeared at #96 on the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs for 2014.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n2007\nUHM – House Ya (Bingo Players Remix)\n2008\nUHM and Tony Flexx – Our House (Bingo Players Remix)\nJosh the Funky 1 – It's the Music (Bingo Players Remix)\nIan Carey – Redlight (Bingo Players Remix)\nErick E – Wanna Go Again (Bingo Players Remix)\nGroovenatics – Joy (Bingo Players Remix)\nGio Martinez, Genetik – Pixel (Bingo Players Remix)\nTodd Terry – Uncle Tech (Bingo Players Remix)\nSoulcatcher feat.

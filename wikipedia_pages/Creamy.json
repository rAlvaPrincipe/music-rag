    "text": "Creamy were a Danish teen-pop duo, composed of Rebekka Mathew and Rannva Joensen.\nTheir 1999 debut album, Creamy, was recorded when the pair were just thirteen years of age, and composed of euro-pop versions of children's songs. In 2001, they released a seasonal album, Christmas Snow. Their only single in the UK was a euro-pop cover of the theme song to the 1984 film Neverending Story, which was featured on their second album, We Got the Time. They were signed to RecArt Music Denmark.\nThe album We Got the Time was produced by Ole Evenrud of A*Teens fame. Evenrud also produced a version of \"Help! I'm a Fish\", a song from the album, for the Danish pop group Little Trees.\nAfter their appearance on Dancemania Speed 10 with a speedy remix of their song \"I Do I Do I Do\" in late 2002, Creamy appeared on the eurodance compilation series Dancemania several times.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== In popular media ==\n\"I Do, I Do, I Do\" is a playable song in Dance Dance Revolution Extreme in Normal, Beginner and Nonstop modes.

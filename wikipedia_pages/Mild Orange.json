Their third album, titled “Looking For Space” was released in early 2022.\nThe band are known for their own self-proclaimed style called 'melting melodies'. Mild Orange's recordings are all produced, engineered and mixed by frontman Josh Mehrtens in between studying, traveling and touring, with the exception of the song \"Stranger\", engineered and mixed by Tom Bell.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2016–2018: Formation and Foreplay ===\nMild Orange originates from Dunedin, New Zealand. The band was originally formed by early childhood friends Josh Mehrtens and Josh Reid who met in kindergarten and by chance met again in university, and later joined by Tom Kelk and Jack Ferguson. All four members hold degrees from the University of Otago. Josh Mehrtens - Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of Arts, Josh Reid - Masters in Sustainable Business, Tom Kelk Bachelor of Applied Science, Jack Ferguson - Bachelor of Arts.\nAccording to the band, the name Mild Orange was chosen because 'The colour orange can cause one to experience a heightened sense of optimism, a boost in aspiration, and a stimulation of warmth and happiness'.\nThe songs on their debut album had their beginnings in 2016 when Mehrtens and Reid found themselves living together in a ten-person flat in Dunedin and spending many nights together writing music. Mehrtens then spent another six months recording the vocals and mixing in Arrowtown and Dunedin. Mehrtens had little previous experience recording or mixing and admitted that there were times he doubted his own experience and abilities.\nTheir debut album, Foreplay was released on 28 April 2018. Foreplay was both independently produced and published, and it was released mainly in digital media. It was critically acclaimed for its \"introspective nature\", and \"soothing guitar melodies\": The record's style was described as \"psychedelic\" and full of \"optimistic but introspective guitar-driven tunes\", and \"an experimental, mellow and decidedly ambient sound. It's very relaxing and uplifting. A sound that is most definitely unconventional and has an Indie soft rock vibe.\" Sam Fraser-Baxter from Hello Zukeen Magazine said \"Foreplay is a thoroughly introspective album. It’s an honest exploration of love and loss. By the time I’d arrived home and had finished Foreplay, I had felt a lot. The album’s honest exploration of emotion, inspires it. You can’t ask for much more from any album.\"\nDuring 2018 they sold out their album release tour of New Zealand with stops in Wellington, Auckland, Christchurch and two shows in Dunedin.\n\n\n=== 2020: Mild Orange ===\nTheir self-titled album, was released 29 May 2020.

    "text": "Mambrú was a male pop group from Buenos Aires, Argentina. They saw both local and international success from 2002 until 2005 when they disbanded. The group's debut album, released in October 2002, had become a triple platinum record by 2003. During the following years, Mambrú became one of the most successful pop acts in Argentina, embarking on a Latin American tour and releasing two more albums: Creciendo (2003) and Mambrú 3 (2005). The group received a number of accolades, including three Gardel Awards and a Martín Fierro Award.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in May 2002, following the outcome of a reality TV show Popstars.

    "text": "The Gypsies are a Danish hip-hop / R&B band with a live sound instead of using backing tracks or turntables. The band's sound is characterized by vocalists Shaka Loveless and Benjamin Kissi. The other members are: Lasse Boman (guitar), Peter Blonde (bass), Andrew Hagedorn (keyboards) and Birk Nevel (drums). The band began before the 2000s as The Electric Gypsies with a more rock-oriented sound. With the addition of Benjamin Kissi, the group moved to a more urban sound and a consequent change of name to The Gypsies.\nIn addition to being regular backing band for Danish names like Jokeren and Outlandish, they have also opened for The Roots and Fugees for their Danish concerts.\nIn 2007, The Gypsies released their debut album, One Hand Up on Superstar Records label. The video for the single \"Part of Me\" from the album was released on 18 January 2008. The follow-up second album was For the Feeble Hearted in 2009.\n\n\n== Other projects ==\nBand members Lasse Boman, Shaka Loveless, Benjamin Kissi and Birk Nevel also play in the side project Are We Brothers?\nLead vocalist Shaka Loveless is also a solo singer with reggae roots.

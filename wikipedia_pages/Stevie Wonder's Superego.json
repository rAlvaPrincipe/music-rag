    "text": "SuperEgo is a short-lived instrumental project conceived and produced by Stevie Wonder in 1979.\n\n\n== Concept ==\nStevie, who had been growing his interest in electronic music, tried to create an album with constant BPMs and heavily use of overdubbing techniques.  Often counting with The Meters as his backing band, Stevie recorded two albums (Vol. 1 and Vol. 2) at his home studio in Detroit through a nine-month period. Both albums were finished but never released and then abandoned due to \"lack of commercial power\", as he says.\n\n\n== Members ==\nStevie Wonder - piano, clavinet, drum machine, synthesizers\nArt Neville - hammond organ, synthesizers\nZiggy Modeliste - drums\nLeo Nocentelli - guitar\nGeorge Porter Jr. - bass guitar\n\n\n== References =="

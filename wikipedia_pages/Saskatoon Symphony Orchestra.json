    "text": "The Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra (SSO) is a professional orchestra based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, administered by the non-profit Saskatoon Symphony Society. The orchestra was founded in 1927 as an amateur orchestra, but today has 10 core members and up to 50 sessional musicians. Arthur Collingwood, who was Professor of Music at the University of Saskatchewan, presented the first SSO concert. The SSO received major funding from the Carnegie Institute in 1931. The Canada Council, the Saskatchewan Arts Board, and the City of Saskatoon have all provided sponsorship of the SSO through the years. In the spring, the symphony holds a Saskatoon Symphony Book & Music Sale to raise funds for the orchestra. The SSO itself offers students grants and hosted a national cello competition in 1990. Dwaine Nelson was responsible for the development of a full-time core of musicians, initially with a size of six, but later expanded to the present-day ten members. In the summer of 2014, the SSO announced that Maestro Victor Sawa would move into the position of Conductor Emeritus at the end of the 84th season. In March 2015, the SSO announced Eric Paetkau as the 16th Music Director of the orchestra.\nUniversity of Saskatchewan Department of Music, University Chorus, Greystone Singers, Saskatoon Chamber Singers, Saskatoon Children's Choir, Regina Symphony Orchestra, Saskatoon Youth Orchestra, and the Amati Quartet have all produced concerts with the SSO. The Canadian Opera Company ensemble, National Ballet, and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet have all performed with accompaniment provided by the SSO. The SSO celebrated its 75th anniversary in the Fall of 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1903, William Preston, who was also involved with the Saskatoon Oratorio Society, began an amateur orchestra in Saskatoon.

The band released \"Learn To Lose\" on June 1 ahead of their debut album Mind Chaos, which was released in the US on September 14 and in the UK on September 28.\nIn late 2009, the band was chosen as one of Beyond Race Magazine's \"50 Emerging Artists,\" resulting in a spot in the publication's #11 issue, as well as a Q&A for the magazine's site.\nIn January 2012, the band announced that they had started recording their upcoming album, and hoped to have it finished by the summer of that year.\nIn March 2018, singer Benjamin states \"Hockey is dead\" in a Facebook post on the original Hockey Facebook page.

    "text": "Sharp (stylized as S#arp; Korean: ìƒµ) was a South Korean co-ed pop vocal group that was active from 1998 to 2002.\nThe group initially consisted of Lee Ji-hye, Seo Ji-young, Jang Seok-hyun, John Kim and Oh Hee-jong. Chris was introduced as a guest member during this time. John and Hee-jong left the group after the release of the group's first album, The S#arp, in 1998. New member Sori and Chris officially joined the group in 1999 for the second album, The S#arp+2. Sori later left the group, and Sharp went on to release the albums, The Four Letter World Love (2000), 4ever Feel So Good (2001), Flat Album (2001), and Style (2002). The group disbanded in 2002, reportedly as a result of ongoing conflict between Ji-hye and Ji-young, including verbal and physical assault.\nSharp was one of the few mixed-gender groups active during an era when single-gender groups such as S.E.S., Fin.K.L, Shinhwa and g.o.d were dominating the music scene. The group won #1 on the music programs Inkigayo and Music Bank, tasting their first success in 1999 with \"Tell Me Tell Me.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== Mnet Asian Music Awards ===\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Solid Gold is a Minneapolis-based indie rock band with an electronic and R&B sound. It consists of Zach Coulter, Adam Hurlburt and Matthew Locher. Solid Gold was voted \"Best Rock Band of 2011\" by the City Pages Readers' Poll.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2002, Solid Gold released their first EP, Solid Gold, followed by a second EP, Out of Your Mind, in 2004. In 2005, the band moved from Madison, Wisconsin to Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nIn 2008, the group released their first studio album, Bodies of Water. The MTV review of Bodies of Water stated: \"[the album] drew comparisons to everything from new wave bands like New Order to ’80s Manchester bands like Happy Mondays and Stone Roses. The lyrics are deliciously obtuse, puzzle pieces of expression that could be fit into multiple meanings, rewarding multiple listens.” NME said of the LP: \"This totally, totally addictive piece of laid-back, twinkling Minneapolis funkiness, has us mercilessly hooked.\"\nIn 2012, the band released their second studio album, Eat Your Young.\n\n\n== Style and influences ==\nPaul Lester of The Guardian said: \"They make downbeat dance music, sad synth-pop, melancholy club tracks, which might sound like a contradiction in terms but not to those of you who have, over the past 25 years, appreciated artists from Pet Shop Boys to Junior Boys.\"\nMTV Iggy said of Solid Gold: \"the overall tenor of remembrance and loss belies the disco superficiality of the band's name. But don’t just judge this band by their recordings. What feels reserved and melancholy on the album gets forgotten when they’re live — taking over the stage, ripping their guitars to shreds, turning the amps up to 11.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nZack Coulter - vocals\nMatt Locher - keyboards, guitar\nAdam Hurlburt - guitar, bass\n\n\n=== Past ===\nJesse Cohen - drums\nShon Troth - slide guitar\nAdam Peterson - drums\nPaulie Heenan - guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBodies of Water (2008)\nEat Your Young (2012)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nSolid Gold (2002)\nOut of Your Mind (2004)\nWho You Gonna Run To?

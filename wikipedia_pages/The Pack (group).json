    "text": "The Pack was a hip hop group formed in Berkeley, California in 2004, composed of rappers Lil B (Brandon McCartney), Young L (Lloyd Omadhebo), Stunnaman (Keith Jenkins), and Lil Uno (Damonte Johnson). They recorded in tandem for over a year at Young L's home studio, during which they released their first two mixtapes: Wolfpack Muzik Vol. 1 (2005) and Wolfpack Muzik Vol. 2 (2006). \nThe group first saw recognition on MySpace with their 2006 single, \"Vans\". The song moderately entered the Billboard Hot 100 and was discovered by fellow California-based hip hop act Too Short, who signed the Pack to his record label Up All Nite Records, an imprint of Jive Records. \"Vans\" preceded the release their debut extended play (EP), Skateboards 2 Scrapers (2006) in December of that year. The EP was followed by their debut studio album, Based Boys (2007), which failed to enter mainstream music charts. They signed with SMC Recordings to release their second album, Wolfpack Party (2010), which also failed to chart and served as their final project before disbanding.\nThe group was known for their \"skateboard raps\", and the sexually explicit content of many of their songs. Its de facto lead member, Lil B has since garnered a cult following for his solo work.\n\n\n== Members ==\nLil B (Brandon Christopher McCartney) - rapper, record producer\nYoung L (Lloyd Tomobor Enibu Omadhebo) - rapper, record producer\nStunnaman (Keith Jenkins) - rapper\nLil Uno (Damonte Johnson) - rapper\n\n\n== Music career ==\n\n\n=== Skateboards 2 Scrapers EP and Based Boys (2006–2008) ===\nSoon after, the Pack created 2006's sneaker anthem \"Vans\" and released it via their Myspace page. The song was heard by veteran Oakland rapper Too Short, who then signed them to his Up All Nite Records imprint via Jive Records. It was also listed at No. 5 on Rolling Stone's \"Best songs of 2006\". The music video for \"Vans\" aired on BET, but MTV, and MTV Jams, refused to show the video because it promoted a consumer product. However, MTV aired an edited version of the video, in which the word \"Vans\" was censored throughout the song. The Pack released a seven track EP in 2006 entitled Skateboards 2 Scrapers, which also included \"Vans\" and the single \"I'm Shinin'\". In 2007, the Pack put out their debut album Based Boys, which included the single \"In My Car\". In early 2008, it was announced that the Pack was dropped from Jive Records/Zomba Label Group due to the album's lackluster sales. The Pack signed with Los Angeles-based Indie Pop which is home to other artists such as the Cataracs, Dev, and Bobby Brackins. In November 2010, Lil B and Young L were featured on the cover of the publication The FADER, in its 71st issue.\n\n\n=== Wolfpack Party (2009–2010) ===\nThe Pack began recording again throughout 2009.

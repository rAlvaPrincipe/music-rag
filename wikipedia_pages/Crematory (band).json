    "text": "Crematory is a German gothic metal band formed in Mannheim, Baden-Württemberg in 1991.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band received its earliest recognition in the mid-1990s by touring with My Dying Bride, Tiamat and Atrocity. Much like the latter two groups, the band had begun as traditional death metal, then evolved in an industrial music and gothic metal musical direction on later albums. The band received heavy rotation on MTV Germany, and made appearances at various extreme metal festivals, including Germany's Wacken Open Air in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2008, in addition to inclusion on Nuclear Blast compilation samplers.\nThe band re-signed to Massacre Records in 2006 after a 10-year stint with Nuclear Blast; Massacre had been the band's first label. In 2013 they signed with Steamhammer/SPV to release their next album, Antiserum. In 2019 they moved to Napalm Records, and their 15th studio album, Unbroken, was released under their label, on 6 March 2020.\nActive for 30 years (with a brief split between 2001 and 2003) they are among Europe's longest-running gothic metal bands.\n\n\n== Line-up ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nGerhard \"Felix\" Stass – lead vocals (1991–present)\nMarkus Jüllich – drums, programming (1991–present)\nKatrin Jüllich – keyboards, samples (1992–present)\nRolf Munkes – lead guitar (2015–present)\nPatrick Schmid – bass (2021–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nMarc Zimmer – bass, backing vocals (1991–1992)\nLothar \"Lotte\" Först – guitars, backing vocals (1991–1998)\nHarald Heine – bass, backing vocals (1993–2016)\nHeinz Steinhauser – bass, backing vocals (1993; died 2021)\nMatthias Hechler – guitars, clean vocals (1998–2015)\nTosse Basler – rhythm guitar, clean vocals (2015–2018)\nJason Mathias – bass (2016–2021)\nConnie \"Conner\" Andreszka – rhythm guitar, clean vocals (2018–2021)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Demos ===\nCrematory (1992)\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nTransmigration (1993)\n...Just Dreaming (1994)\nIllusions (1995)\nCrematory (1996)\nAwake (1997)\nAct Seven (1999)\nBelieve (2000)\nRevolution (2004)\nKlagebilder (2006)\nPray (2008)\nInfinity (2010)\nAntiserum (2014)\n Monument (2016)\n Oblivion (2018)\n Unbroken (2020)\n Inglorious Darkness (2022)\n Destination (2025)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nLive... at the Out of the Dark Festivals (1997)\nLive Revolution (2005)\nLive in Wacken  (2008)\n Black Pearls (2010)\n Live at W.O.A (2014)\n Live Insurrection ' ' (2017)\n Live At Wacken  (2022)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\nIst es wahr (1996)\nFly (1999)\nGreed (2004)\nShadowmaker (2013)\nThe Downfall (2020)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nEarly Years (1999)\nRemind (2001)\nBlack Pearls (2010)\nInception (2013)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nCrematory at AllMusic \nCrematory discography at Discogs"

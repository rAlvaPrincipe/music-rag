    "text": "Ajax is an American, New York-based band, led by female singer Arleen Mitchel. The outfit released the single \"Mind the Gap\" in 1989, on Wax Trax! Records. A full-length self-titled debut LP followed, which combined industrial and acid-house music. The album, and its two singles failed to chart.\nMitchel revived the name in the 1990s, most successfully on the 1995 single \"Ex-Junkie\" which became a minor club hit. \"Ex-Junkie\" is the band's first (and to date last) entry on the Billboard Hot Dance/Club chart, peaking at number 48.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\nChart information courtesy of Billboard.com and AllMusic\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAjax on AllMusic\nAjax on Discogs"

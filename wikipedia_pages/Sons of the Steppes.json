    "text": "Sons of the Steppes (Uk: Сини степів or Syny Stepiv ) is a Canadian–Ukrainian pop band from Montreal, Canada that performed in the 1970s and early 1980s.  Like the popular Canadian band Rushnychok at the time, the quartet used a set of instruments and a combination of rock and folk music, jazz and other styles.  The band's repertoire included Ukrainian folk songs and (at that time) modern songs in their own arrangement, as well as their own songs. The band's first album made \"Sons of the Steppes\" popular throughout the North American continent. All three of their albums were quite successful and popular not only in Canada and the US, but also in Europe and Soviet Ukraine (where they were distributed illegally through tape recordings).\nMusicians performed on stages decorated with traditional Ukrainian motifs, in traditional Ukrainian folk costume.  The musicians themselves possessed a diverse number of instruments and repeatedly joined other bands directly during performances. At the peak of their popularity, Sons of the Steppes performed many performances, concerts and shows.\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, the ensemble ceased its activities, three of its members organized a new band \"Вечірній дзвін\" (Evening Bell)\".\n\n\n== Band members ==\nТарас Дідусь (Taras Didus) – accordion, vocals\nТіно Папа (Tino Papa) – drums\nАдріан Альбощий (Adrian Alboschy) – guitar, vocals (album II and III)\nЯрослав Воркевич (Yaroslav Vorkevych) — guitar, vocals (albums I and II)\nЯрослав Гудзьо (Yaroslav Gudzo) – guitar, vocals (albums I and III)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Сини степів I (Sons of the steppes I) ===\n1974, DUMY Productions – DU 7406 (LP)\n\nЧеревички (Boots)\nГаню, моя Ганю (Ganyu, my Ganyu)\nГаличаночка (Halychanochka) (Yu.

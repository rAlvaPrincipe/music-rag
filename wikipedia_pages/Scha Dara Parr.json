    "text": "Scha Dara Parr (スチャダラパー, Suchadarapā), or SDP for short, is a three-member Japanese hip-hop group that formed in 1988 and debuted in 1990.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group consists of two MCs, Bose and Ani, and one DJ, Shinco.  Scha Dara Parr is often compared to rap trio the Beastie Boys due to their similar lyrical stylings, presence, and music. When pushed to describe the rebelliousness of their music, the group commented that many of their songs are simply fragments of conversation without polite words.\nThe group is best known for their 1994 hit single, \"Kon'ya wa Boogie-Back\" (今夜はブギー・バック, Kon'ya wa Bugī Bakku) featuring Kenji Ozawa (小沢 健二), which attained sales of over 500,000 units. The song is based on samples from En Vogue's 1992 single, \"Give It Up, Turn It Loose.\"\nScha Dara Parr gained minor US recognition by appearing on De La Soul's 1993 album, Buhloone Mindstate. The group rapped in a mixture of mostly Japanese and some English on the track \"Long Island Wildin'\".\nThe 1991 single \"Game Boyz\" (ゲームボーイズ) from the group's second album \"Towering Nonsense\" (タワリングナンセンス) was featured in the Japanese commercial for The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAni: Yōsuke Matsumoto (松本洋介) - MC\nBose: Makoto Kōshima (光嶋誠) - MC\nShinco: Shinsuke Matsumoto (松本真介) - DJ\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nScha Dara Daisakusen (1990)\nTowering Nonsense (1991)\nWild Fancy Alliance (1993)\n5th Wheel 2 The Coach (1995)\nGūzen no Album (1996)\nfun-key LP (1998)\nDocompact Disc (2000)\nThe 9th Sense (2004)\nCon10po (2006)\n11 (2009)\n1212 (2015)\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\nScha Dara Gaiden (1994)\nAnishinbou (2016)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nPotent Hits ~Single Collection~ (1994)\nToshiba Classic 95-97 (1998)\nCAN YOU COLLABORATE?~best collaboration songs&music clips (2008)\nBest of Schadaraparr 1990-2010 (2010)\n\n\n=== Remix albums ===\nCycle Hits ~remix Best Collection~ (1995)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nProfile on Discogs"

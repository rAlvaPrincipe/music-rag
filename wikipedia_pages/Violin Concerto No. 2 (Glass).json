    "text": "Philip Glass' Violin Concerto No. 2, titled The American Four Seasons, received its world premiere in Toronto on December 9, 2009, with violinist Robert McDuffie (for whom the work was composed) and co-commissioner the Toronto Symphony Orchestra under conductor Peter Oundjian. Its European premiere was in London on April 17, 2010, with McDuffie and co-commissioner the London Philharmonic Orchestra under conductor Marin Alsop. Its total duration is around 38 minutes.\n\n\n== Conception ==\nGlass composed the work in the summer and autumn of 2009 after several years of exchanges between him and McDuffie with the idea of creating a piece that would serve as a companion to Vivaldi's The Four Seasons. When the work was presented to McDuffie, it emerged that his interpretation of the seasons was somewhat different from Glass'. For this reason, Glass presents this as an opportunity for the listener to make his/her own interpretation. The titles of the movements therefore offer no clues as to where Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter might fall, with the composer welcoming other interpretations.\nInstead of the cadenza typically found in most violin concertos, Glass provided a number of solo pieces for the violinist, which act as a prelude to the first movement, and three \"songs\" that precede each of the following three movements. Glass also anticipated that these could be played together as separate concert music when abstracted from the whole work.\nThis concerto is now in the repertoire of the Kremerata Baltica and was played for the first time in San José, Costa Rica with Gidon Kremer as soloist in August, 2013.\n\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThe concerto is scored for solo violin, strings and synthesizer.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nMichael White of the Daily  Telegraph wrote the following (Cited at Richard Guerin (April 20, 2010). \"'Classic art' ... \"This new concerto is unmitigated trash.\"\". philipglass.com. Retrieved February 19, 2018.>:\n\"Listening to Philip Glass is about as rewarding as chewing gum\nthat’s lost its flavour, and they’re not dissimilar activites. But I\ndid go to the UK premiere of his new violin concerto, more to witness\nits reception than anything else. And the reception, I’m sorry to say,\nwas rapturous: a standing ovation. Which proves that even if you can’t\nfool all the people all the time, you can hoodwink a depressing number\nfor a fair while.\nThis new concerto is unmitigated trash: the usual strung out\nsequences of arpeggiated banality, driven by the rise and fall of\nfast-moving but still leaden triplets, and vacuously formulaic. Whatever\ngives Glass cause to think he can get away with it I can’t imagine\n(well, perhaps I can: those damned standing ovations). But in this case\nthe offence is the worse for the portentous title he’s appended.\nHe calls it ‘The American Four Seasons’ – with, you’ll note, the\ndefinite article: not just ‘a’ but ‘the’. In truth, there are some\ncorrespondences of texture, mood and structure that support the title.\nTo a point. But Philip Glass is no Vivaldi, a composer who even at his\nmost wallpaper baroque still has something to say. Glass has nothing –\nthough he presumably deludes himself into thinking he does: hence the\npreponderance of slow, reflective solo writing in the piece which\nassumes there’s something to reflect on.\nAn American violinist called Robert McDuffie played the solos with\nall the dignity he could muster (he’s tall, plays in a business suit,\nlooks like a senior vice president at Goldman Sachs: it helps) but you\ncouldn’t attribute any distinction to what he did. The tone was scrawny,\nintonation suspect.\nMarin Alsop conducted the LPO who had co-commissioned the piece. The\nonly question on my mind as I left the hall was: Why?\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCompositions, Glass Notes, Recordings at PhilipGlass.com\nLegal 2016 recording on YouTube (by Robert McDuffie and the American Youth Symphony)"

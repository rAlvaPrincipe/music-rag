The band released an accompanying video in which all five members are shown playing on the same guitar simultaneously. The production was taken from the 26th cut of a 14-hour session. Ellen DeGeneres featured the band on her January 23, 2012, show where they played live, again on one guitar; the group was also included in YouTube Rewind 2012 \"Rewind YouTube Style 2012\", doing a part of its one-guitar acoustic version of \"Gangnam Style\".\nIn February 2012, the band signed a recording contract with Columbia Records.

Founded in the Galilee region of Israel by Elam Rotem, the ensemble is currently based in Basel, Switzerland, where its members undertook advanced studies at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis.

In summer 2011 the ensemble won the York Early Music International Young Artists competition at the (NCEM), propelling its international career.

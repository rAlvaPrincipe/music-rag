    "text": "OceanLab (or Above & Beyond presents OceanLab) is a vocal trance group formed in 2000 in London. The group consists of vocalist Justine Suissa and the three members of Above & Beyond: Jono Grant, Paavo Siljamäki, and Tony McGuinness. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nThe initial success of the band was due to the remixes of the popular trance pieces.\nTheir first single, released in 2001, was the song \"Clear Blue Water\", which was remixed by several artists — the most successful of which was by Ferry Corsten. The track peaked at #48 in the UK Singles Chart in April 2002. The second single, \"Sky Falls Down\", was released in 2002 and remixed by Armin van Buuren. The third single, \"Beautiful Together\", was released in 2003 and was remixed by Seraque, Silvester, and Signum. The single that is considered to be their break-through track is \"Satellite\", their fourth single, which was released in 2004. It reached #19 in the UK chart in May 2004, higher than any other track released by the act, or Above & Beyond on their own. Its chart position was assisted by being playlisted on BBC Radio 1.\nOn August 24, 2007, \"Breaking Ties\" (Above & Beyond's Analog Haven Mix), was featured on Trance Around the World Episode #178.  Although Miracle was given as the title on the Above & Beyond official forum, at the time the title was unconfirmed.\nMcGuinness and Siljamäki of OceanLab discussed the album during an interview in Riga, Latvia: \"We've been experimenting with a completely new sound - one of the tracks we're working on right now features a 56 piece mouse choir. We went diving in Formentera too to record some noises from the dolphins.\"\nOn March 14, 2008, \"Sirens of the Sea\" (Above & Beyond Club Mix) premiered on Trance Around the World Episode #207. It was presented as one of the new singles for the upcoming album. Prior to this, \"Sirens of the Sea\" (Kyau & Albert Remix) was released on Above and Beyond's Anjunabeats Volume 3.\nOn April 7, 2008, the single \"Sirens of the Sea\" was released. New remixes by Sonorous, Cosmic Gate, Maor Levi, as well as the Kyau & Albert remix were included.\nOn June 10, 2008, OceanLab's debut album - Sirens of the Sea - was announced on the Anjunabeats website with a release date of 21 July 2008. The single, \"Miracle\", appeared a week earlier, on July 14, 2008. Included on the single are Above and Beyond's Club Mix of tracks, as well as remixes by Martin Roth, Michael Cassette, and Fletch. The \"Sirens of the Sea Remixed\" album released in 2009 includes the most successful remixes of OceanLab's three most popular tracks that had only been released as singles - Satellite, Sky Falls Down, and Clear Blue Water.\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\nOn January 30, 2014, McGuinness and Siljamäki confirmed via Reddit that the artist name OceanLab would no longer be used on future productions, with Justine Suissa now being identified as a part of Above & Beyond.\nAfter a full-year hiatus, the group announced their return with a new single at Above & Beyond's ABGT150 concert in September 2015.On September 26, 2015, however, Above & Beyond featured a new surprise OceanLab production at ABGT150 in Sydney, titled Another Chance. It was released as a single containing the original mix and the Above & Beyond Club Mix on November 4, 2016. \nOn September 24, 2016, Above & Beyond featured a new OceanLab production at ABGT200 in the Ziggo Dome, Amsterdam. The title of this new single is \"Alright Now.\"  The Above & Beyond Club Mix of the track was originally released on Anjunabeats Volume 13, but was released as a standalone single on May 12, 2017. It was released on Above & Beyond's 2018 album, Common Ground.\n\n\n=== 2020s ===\nJustine with Above & Beyond have collaborated to release a \"Almost Home\" track in 2021. It was the first collab after a 4-year period of falling out. \nIn 2023, a limited edition music set (featuring Seven Lions, with remixes of greatest hits), to commemorate a second decade of their existence, was released.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n2008 Sirens of the Sea\n2009 Sirens of the Sea Remixed\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n2001 \"Clear Blue Water\" - UK #48 (in 2002)\n2002 \"Sky Falls Down\"\n2003 \"Beautiful Together\"\n2004 \"Satellite\" - UK #19\n2008 \"Sirens of the Sea\"\n2008 \"Miracle\"\n2008 \"Breaking Ties\"\n2008 \"Come Home\"\n2009 \"On A Good Day\"\n2009 \"Lonely Girl\"\n2010 \"On A Good Day (Metropolis)\"\n2016 \"Another Chance\"\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n2001 Teaser: - \"When Love Breaks Down\" (OceanLab Remix)\n2002 Ascension: - \"For a Lifetime\" (OceanLab Remix)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOceanLab discography at Discogs \n\nOceanlab on Spotify"

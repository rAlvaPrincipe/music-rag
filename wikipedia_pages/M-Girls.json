    "text": "M-Girls (Chinese: 四个女生) is a Malaysian girl group consisting of Queenzy Cheng, Angeline Khoo, Cass Chin and Crystal Ong. The group was formed in 2001.\nAlthough M-Girls studio albums have been officially released in many different parts of the world, the group has been a longstanding victim to piracy and unlicensed, illegal distribution. As a result, the group's music company, Starmedia, decided to stop producing additional M-Girls albums in 2014. This announcement came out during the release of the Chinese New Year album True Happiness (真歡喜) in February 2014, weeks after the release of their EP, My Way.\nIn 2015, M-Girls released one last CNY album, New Spring Holiday (新春佳期), through Starmedia. Afterwards, the group later on decided to part ways with the music company and established their own company, MG Entertainment. This new company's first album release was entitled The New Year is Coming (年來了), which came out in 2016.\nAs of 2017, the members of M-Girls are taking a break from working together as a group and would not be producing any albums together. Instead, everyone is currently pursuing solo projects and endeavors for the time being.\nIn November 2023, Cheng died at the age of 37 while filming a video production.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut ===\nPrior to the group's formation, all members originally were under Ya-Ko Enterprise, with Khoo debuting in 7-member girl group known as Seven Fairies (七仙女).\n\n\n=== 2000–2005: Debut and Chin's departure ===\nM-Girls debuted in 2001 with the Chinese New Year Song, \"Happily Welcoming the Harvest Year\" (開心迎接豐收年). It set sales records and sold over 50,000 copies, receiving platinum status. In 2004, M-Girls released a Chinese New Year album with Four Golden Princess titled \"Flowers Blossom in the Spring\" (春風催花開). Their title music video set a new Malaysia Book of Records at the time for the most number of lion dancers in a music video with 108 lion dancers. The former record holding music video had 88 which was shot around two years before. In 2005, with the release of \"Happy Year\" (開心年) which was filmed in Australia, Chin announced that she would leave the group to concentrate on her studies.\n\n\n=== 2005–2012: \"Nile River\" and Cheng's departure ===\nAfter Chin left, M-Girls released \"Nile River\" (尼罗河) in 2005, becoming their last mandopop album release until \"My Way\". After the release of their 2010 Chinese New Year album \"Abundant Wealth\" (金玉满堂), Cheng left the group following the end of her contract with the company.\n\n\n=== 2014: \"True Happiness\", \"New Spring Holiday\", appearance on Nick & Stella & \"The New Year Is Coming\" ===\nOn 27 November 2014, their 2014 Chinese New Year album \"True Joy\" (眞歡喜) was shown on Starmedia Distribution, which was known as Wayang Tinggi Corporation back then. Its distribution is from PMP Entertainment. One day later, pre-release was announced for their new Chinese New Year album. This would be M-Girls' final Chinese New Year album as their albums are heavily shared online, which affected their album sales, causing Starmedia to stop producing their Chinese New Year albums.\nOn 23 February 2015, M-Girls had their final concert for Hai-O at the HGC Convention Centre in Malaysia. After mass online speculation, it was revealed that they will indeed release Chinese New Year 2015 album \"New Spring Holiday\" (新春佳期). This year for the first time M-Girls cover an English song called Happy CNY, and also a Hokkien song called 發大財 which translates to fortune.\n\nFilming for their 2016 Chinese New Year album began on 8 September 2015. Recording started the previous month. Angeline and Crystal also made an appearance in Nick and Stella Chung's CNY album, \"New Year Reunion\" (新年團圓). The advertisement of the release of their latest Chinese New Year album titled \"年來了\" which translates to Year is Coming was released on 21 November 2015. This is the first time they have released an album since they left their former company Starmedia.\nIn 2017, it was announced that M-Girls would take a break to focus on solo activities.\n\n\n=== Members ===\nQueenzy Cheng (莊群施)\nAngeline Khoo (阿妮)\nCass Chin (燕子)\nCrystal Ong (王雪晶)\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Non-Chinese New Year albums ===\n\n\n=== Chinese New Year albums ===\n\n\n=== Other albums ===\nPrior to the formation of M-Girls, the members started producing albums at the age of around 6–10 years old. Listed are the albums that they released before the group formation, and also other albums not as the group M-Girls. All Chinese New Year albums are produced months before the release date, but are released for the next year.\n\n\n==== Queenzy Cheng ====\n1995. 雙星報喜 Vol.1 Double Stars Bring Luck Vol.1 (feat.

    "text": "Knower, also stylized as KNOWER, is an American independent electronic jazz-funk duo. The group primarily consists of Louis Cole (bass, drums, guitars, keyboards, vocals) and Genevieve Artadi (bass, keyboards, vocals); their full band includes saxophone, bass and keyboard players. They have gained success releasing music online.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years and formation ===\nLouis Cole studied music in Los Angeles, California, graduating from the jazz studies program at USC Thornton in 2009. He became good friends with fellow musician Jack Conte in 2006. Both composed and recorded some songs, which are present on Conte's YouTube channel. Conte suggested Cole start releasing his music online. Genevieve Artadi also studied music in Los Angeles. She received her bachelor's degree in jazz studies at California State University (CSU) Northridge and did post-graduate studies at CSU Long Beach.\nCole and Artadi met through the LA-based saxophonist Robby Marshall. In 2009 Cole and Artadi joined forces. \n\n\n=== Career ===\nKnower released their first album in 2010. In early 2010, the group began to upload their music to YouTube. Their first video, a cover of Britney Spears's song \"3\" got a lot of hits quickly thanks to Jack Conte promoting it on YouTube. Another early video release, \"Window Shop\" (originally recorded on Louis Cole's first album) also got a lot of hits thanks to a front page YouTube feature. In this same year, they released their debut album, Louis Cole and Genevieve Artadi.\nIn 2011, their second album Think Thoughts was released. Songs such as \"Around\" and \"I Remember\" presented some heavy funk grooves. Soon after the release of this album, the group collaborated with Pomplamoose to release a single, \"It Goes On.\" Sporting the group's distinctive electro-funk sound, the single brought increased visibility to the duo.\nLet Go, Knower's third album, was released in 2013. They followed the release of Let Go with a performance at Bonnaroo Festival with Soul Khan, Jenny Suk, and Black Violin. Knower also went on a tour of the east coast United States with duo WeYou, consisting of Nate Wood and Jesske Hume.\nIn 2014, Knower released the non-album single \"I Must Be Dreaming\", and toured the East Coast and the South. They were also presented by Quincy Jones in a new artist concert series in Los Angeles. Their song \"Fuck the Makeup, Skip the Shower\" was featured on FlyLo FM (hosted by Flying Lotus) on the next-gen version of Grand Theft Auto V.\nIn 2015, Knower recorded with Snarky Puppy on their Family Dinner – Volume 2.\nIn 2016 they released their fourth album, Life, and formed a 5-piece live band as an alternative lineup. Apart from the core members, the band at various points included Tim Lefebvre, Dennis Hamm, Sam Wilkes, Sam Gendel, Nate Wood and Jonah Nilsson. Their European tour of 2016, as well as parts of the US tour, featured the live band.\nIn July 2017, Knower opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers in four major European cities, and since that year they have performed in many European cities with the Norrbotten Big Band of Sweden.\nIn 2018, Knower toured Europe, China, Japan, and the US, continuing the live band formation and also unveiling a renovated duo set with Artadi and Cole. \nIn 2019, Knower collaborated with Bob Minzer and the WDR Big Band for a performance at JazzFest Bonn while also releasing videos of rehearsal sessions in studio in Cologne. They also expanded their touring that year, travelling to South Africa and South America, including Rapa Nui.\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the pair released a \"living room power set\" onto their YouTube Channel, which included live performances of \"Overtime\", \"Time Traveler\", \"Pizza\", and \"It's Time\", among other songs.\nTheir fifth album, Knower Forever, was released exclusively on Bandcamp as a paid digital download and physical LP in June 2023, along with three free songs publicly available on YouTube; \"I'm The President\", \"The Abyss\" and \"Crash The Car\", to commercial success. Knower also included a choir, along with strings and brass sections on a lot of the songs on this album. The album was later released across other streaming platforms in October 2023.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nCore members\n\nGenevieve Artadi – lead vocals, keyboards, bass (2009–present)\nLouis Cole – drums, keyboards, backing vocals (2009–present)\nAdditional and former additional members\n\nAdam Ratner – guitar\nAmber Navran – flute\nAya Toyoshima – trombone\nBlaine McGurty – keyboard\nChiquita Magic – keyboard, backing vocals\nCory Wong – guitar\nDanielle Firouzi – piano\nDavid Binney – saxophone\nDennis Hamm – keyboard\nEldar Djangirov – keyboard\nJack Conte – keyboard, drums\nJacob Mann – keyboard\nJohn Escreet – piano\nJonah Nilsson – keyboard\nMonoNeon – bass\nNataly Dawn – bass, backing vocals\nNicholas Semrad – keyboard\nRai Thistlethwayte – keyboard\nPaul Cornish – keyboard, piano\nPetter Olofsson – bass\nSam Gendel – saxophone\nSam Wilkes – bass\nSammy Stephens – vocals\nThom Gill – guitar, backing vocals\nTim Lefebvre – bass\nVikram Devasthali – raps, trombone\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKnower's channel on YouTube\nKnower's Bandcamp page"

    "text": "The Youth in Music Band Championships is an annual high school marching band competition in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is one of the largest marching band events in the Upper Midwest, attracting three dozen competitors and thousands of spectators every year. The Annual Championships are held the 2nd Saturday in October, at U.S. Bank Stadium.\n\nThe first championship was held in 2005. Since 2006, state championship honors have been awarded to competing bands from Minnesota.\nThe competition has been called the YIM Grand Championships and YIM Upper Midwest Championships. The competition and its awards are also known as the YIMMYs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Past participants ===\nBands from Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota and Nebraska have attended YIM since its inception. The following is an incomplete list of recent and past participating bands.\n† Indicates a past participant.\n\n\n==== Illinois bands ====\nSouth High School†, Downers Grove\nLincoln-Way Community High School District 210\nLincoln-Way Central High School†, New Lenox\nLincoln-Way East High School†, Frankfort\n\n\n==== Iowa bands ====\nMOC-Floyd Valley High School†, Orange City\nSioux City Community Schools\nNorth High School†, Sioux City\nWest High School†, Sioux City\n\n\n==== Minnesota bands ====\n\n\n==== South Dakota bands ====\n\n\n==== Nebraska bands ====\nBellevue East High School, Bellevue\nMillard North High School, Omaha\nMillard West High School, Omaha\n\n\n==== Wisconsin bands ====\n\n\n=== Past championship locations ===\n\n\n== Classification and adjudication ==\nYIM utilizes their own Adjudication Handbook and have created their own adjudication sheets.  Tabulation software is provided by Competition Suite.\n\n\n=== Classifications ===\nThree classes, A, AA, AAA, have been available since 2005. In 2016, AAAA Class was added. Criteria for class alignment is unknown. However, an archived FAQ from 2007 suggested participating bands consider school attendance, the number of performing members, booster organization, experience of staff and other qualitative information when selecting a class. \n\n\n=== Captions and rubric ===\nScoring is based on two broad categories: Performance, and Effect. The categories are further divided into four reference criteria or captions, with each given a maximum value of 200 points, or up to 20 points when factored. Percussion and Auxiliary (or color guard) captions are also available. Both given a maximum value of 100 points, or ten points when factored. The final score is tabulated by adding all captions, less any penalties.\n\nOne adjudicator is assigned to each caption, and one each for percussion and auxiliary. An additional adjudicator is responsible for timing and penalties.\nYIM does have captions for Best Visual, Best Colorguard, Best Percussion Section, YIMMY Drum Major and YIMMY Best Performer Overall. Youth in Music also honors a YIMMY Hall of Fame Band Director each year.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nAs of 2017, the top scoring band in each class, and the next six highest scoring bands from the first, preliminary, round advance to the final round. The two rounds are called Sessions I and II by competition organizers. Following the preliminary round, caption awards for \"Outstanding Percussion\", \"Outstanding Winds\", and \"Outstanding Color Guard\" which are given to recipients in each class.\n\n\n=== YIMMY awards ===\nRecognition is also given to \"Best Drum Major\" and \"Best Performer\" in response to their performance excellence. The \"Spirit of YIMMY\" award is given to one band each year in recognition for their esprit de corps. The criteria for these awards is unknown.\nAn award memorializing musician Butch DuFault is given to an outstanding band director. YIM has awarded academic scholarships to participating students in the past.\n\n\n=== Minnesota State Marching Band Championships ===\nYIM began awarding state championship honors in 2006. The format for such awards has varied. In 2017, honors were given to the top three highest scoring Minnesota bands in each class. A single state champion award has also been announced in years prior.\nThe inclusion of a state championship award was likely due to other Minnesota music education organizations lack of sanctioned marching band events. Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL), the Minnesota NFHS affiliate, only organizes soloist and small ensemble festivals. Minnesota Music Educators Association (MMEA), the Minnesota NAfME affiliate, organizes an All-State honor band program which includes concert and jazz bands. And the Minnesota Band Directors Association (MBDA) has only issued guidelines for marching band performances, in addition to organizing an alternative All-State concert and jazz honor band.\n\n\n== Past champions ==\nYIM realigned the classes available in 2016. A Grand Champion award was not awarded in 2005.\n\n\n=== Minnesota State Marching Band Champions ===\nBelow is an incomplete list of Minnesota State Marching Band Champions awarded at YIM:\n\n\n== See also ==\nBands of America\nMid-America Competing Band Directors Association\nNorthwest Association for Performing Arts\nWestern Band Association\n\n\n== References =="

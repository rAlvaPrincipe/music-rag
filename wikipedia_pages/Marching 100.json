    "text": "The marching band at Florida A&M University is commonly and widely known as the \"Marching 100\" or simply \"The 100.\" Since its inception, the band has been credited with 30 innovative techniques that have become standard operating procedures for many high school and collegiate marching band programs.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first band at FAMU was organized in 1892, under Phillip Amos von Weller. In 1946, when William P. Foster was selected as director of bands, there were only 16 members.  Since then, the band has grown to as many as over 400 members.   The band has performed at the Super Bowl (on several occasions), the Summer Olympics, the inaugural parades for U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and was selected in 1989 as the official United States representative in the Bicentennial Celebration of the French Revolution in Paris, France.\nThe band has also been featured as the opening act for the Louis Vuitton's men's fashion show at the Louvre during the 2022 Paris Fashion Week.\n\n\n== Directors, assistant directors, and staff ==\n\n\n=== Directors ===\nPhillip Amos Von Weller, 1892–1897\nNathaniel Campbell Adderley, 1910\nHerman A.

Parham, Office Manager\n\n\n== Band motto ==\nThe band motto was developed by William Patrick Foster at the beginning of his more than 50-year tenure as director of bands at FAMU. Their motto is as follows:\nHighest Quality of CHARACTER\nAchievement in ACADEMICS\nAttainment of LEADERSHIP\nPerfection in MUSICIANSHIP\nPrecision in MARCHING\nDedication to SERVICE\n\n\n== Summer Band Camp ==\n\nThe Marching 100 Summer Band Camp has existed since 1990, when it had fewer than 100 members. The majority of those in attendance were from Burke HS (Charleston, South Carolina), and William M. Raines HS (Jacksonville, Florida). Apart from the marching band, there are three symphonic bands (Honor, Orange, and Green), two jazz bands, a percussion ensemble, keyboard and electronic music, and an ensemble for every instrument. The camp also includes drum majors and auxiliaries.\n\n\n== Hazing Cases ==\n\nEvidence of hazing in the band made headlines after the death of a Marching 100 drum major in 2011.  On November 19, 2011, Robert Champion, the 26-year-old drum major, was beaten to death on the bus after the annual Blue Cross Blue Shield Florida Classic between Florida A&M University and Bethune Cookman University.  Investigators found that hazing was involved in the incident. The Orange County Sheriff's Office ruled the death a homicide.  An autopsy determined that he had \"badly beaten muscles.\"  Florida A&M canceled all of the band's remaining scheduled performances for the 2011–12 school year and launched an investigation.\nIn May 2012, two faculty members resigned in connection with the ensuing hazing investigation and 13 people were charged with felony or misdemeanor hazing crimes.  Later that month, FAMU president James Ammons announced that the band would not return until 2013–14 at the earliest out of respect for Champion, as well as to give school officials time for a root-and-branch restructuring of the band.  Earlier, it had been revealed that at least 101 band members were not enrolled at FAMU.  Two months later, Ammons resigned. On August 28, 2012, Dante Martin, identified as the \"president\" of the band bus, was accused of felony hazing in Robert Champion's death. He pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with a separate hazing incident. After an unsuccessful mediation session between university attorneys and attorneys representing the family of Robert Champion, FAMU offered to pay $300,000 to the family during the first week of November 2012 as settlement. On March 4, 2013, prosecutors charged 12 former band members with manslaughter for the 2011 hazing death. On June 27, 2013, Florida A&M lifted the suspension of the band.  School officials instituted new academic requirements for the band, as well as a zero-tolerance policy for hazing that applies to all campus organizations. On October 31, 2014, Dante Martin was found guilty of manslaughter and three counts of hazing and on January 9, 2015, he was sentenced to six years in prison.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

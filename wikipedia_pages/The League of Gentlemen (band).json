    "text": "The League of Gentlemen were a band active during March–December 1980 that featured King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOther members included bass guitarist Sara Lee (who later joined Gang of Four, the B-52's, and Indigo Girls), keyboardist Barry Andrews (formerly of XTC; later of Shriekback) and percussionist Johnny Elichaoff (who is referred to on the album as \"Johnny Toobad\").  Elichaoff was replaced late in the band's tenure by Kevin Wilkinson (later of China Crisis and Squeeze).\nThe 1980 group should not be confused with Robert Fripp's first semi-professional band in the 1960s, which had the same name.\nFripp referred to the 1980 band as \"a second-division touring new wave instrumental dance band\".\nThe Trouser Press Record Guide described the League of Gentlemen's music as typically taking \"a simple medium-to-fast backbeat over which Fripp and Andrews locked horns, with melodic development emerging slowly, surely, subtly.\" Trouser Press also suggests that the League's foray into dance oriented rock was a precursor to Fripp's reformed King Crimson in the early 1980s.\nThe band toured extensively in Europe and North America throughout 1980.\nThere are 77 specific tour dates detailed in the sleevenotes on the  album The League of Gentlemen. Missing from this list are four (possibly warm-up) gigs at the 14th Century Hunting Lodge (now Lodge Farm House), outside the grounds of Kingston Lacy near Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England. These gigs are dated 24 to 27 February and pre-dated the first 'official' gig on 10 April at Moles, Bath.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio album ===\nThe League of Gentlemen (EG/Polydor, 1981)\n\n\n=== Live album ===\nThrang Thrang Gozinbulx (constructed from bootleg recordings) (Discipline Records, 1996)\n\n\n=== Compilation ===\nGod Save the King (Editions EG, 1985)\n\n\n== Album personnel ==\nRobert Fripp – guitar\nSara Lee – bass\nBarry Andrews – organ\nKevin Wilkinson – drums (except A4 Heptaparaparshinokh and A5 Dislocated)\nJohnny Toobad – drums on Heptaparaparshinokh and Dislocated\nDanielle Dax – vocals and lyrics (\"Hamsprachtmuzic\") on Minor Man; she also provided the cover artwork for the album\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nTamm, Eric (2003) [1990], \"8 Out of retirement—'The Drive to 1981'\", Robert Fripp: From crimson king to crafty master (Progressive Ears ed.), Faber and Faber (1990), ISBN 0-571-16289-4, Zipped Microsoft Word Document, archived from the original on 3 March 2012, retrieved 26 October 2011\n\n\n== External links ==\ndiscogs.com/artist: The League of Gentlemen"

    "text": "Monsta Island Czars was a Long Island/New York City hip-hop collective that was formed by MF Grimm and included MF Doom among numerous Long Beach MC's. Due to inactivity and DOOM's death in 2020, the group ceased activity.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe members of the group take their names from movie monsters from Toho's Godzilla movies. Escape from Monsta Island!, their only full-length album, was released in 2003 by Metal Face Records. Most M.I.C. (Monsta Island Czars) tracks are produced by King Caesar (aka X-Ray) or King Geedorah (aka MF Doom).\nThere was a rumor that in 2007, remaining members of M.I.C. were set to release a new album titled Return To Monsta Island - however, this was dispelled in an interview with X-Ray. Fans soon became unsure whether the group was on hiatus or had broken up. Clues included the collective's MySpace webpage being deleted and their official site (monstaisland.com) going dark.  In 2007 rumors continued that M.I.C. was still active and working on new tracks, but nothing seemed to come out of it.\nIn 2013 and 2016, X-Ray released two new albums titled All Hail The King and All The King's Men, respectively, featuring multiple members of M.I.C. including Spiga, Kong, Kamackeris, Megalon, and Rodan. Although these aren't official Monsta Island Czars projects, they are confirmation much of the group is still together and making music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nEscape from Monsta Island!

It performed duties outlined by military regulations. During the Russo-Japanese War, military musicians took part in combat battles for the Imperial Russian Army. The modern military band was founded in 1946 by order of Marshal of the Soviet Union Rodion Malinovsky, to represent the military of the newly formed district in neighboring China. At that time, there was military band in Khabarovsk, with military musicians being seconded on this from the city of Chita, where the district administration headquarters was based.\n\n\n== Overview of activities ==\nIt performs on holidays such as Victory Day (9 May) and Defender of the Fatherland Day (23 February).

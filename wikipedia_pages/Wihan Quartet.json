The quartet was founded at the Prague Academy of Musical Arts in 1985 by Leoš Čepický (violin), Jan Schulmeister (violin), Jiří Žigmund (viola) and Aleš Kaspřík (cello). The group's teacher was Antonín Kohout of the Smetana Quartet and it took its name of Hanuš Wihan (1855–1920), cellist and spiritus rector of the Bohemian Quartet.\nThe quartet won the Prague Spring International Music Competition (1988), the chamber music competition at Trapani, Sicily (1990), and the London International String Quartet Competition (1991).

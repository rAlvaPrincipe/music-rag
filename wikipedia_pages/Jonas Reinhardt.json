    "text": "Jonas Reinhardt is an American electronic music producer with releases on Kranky, Not Not Fun, and others. Jonas Reinhardt's sound is influenced by electronic music of the 1970s,'80s, '90s and even 2000s, particularly in the use of analog synthesizers and keyboards. His music has taken on numerous forms over the years, starting with the kosmische pulsations of his 2008 eponymous debut before embracing disco rhythms on releases like 2013's Mask of the Maker. After releasing an experimental science fiction soundtrack (Ganymede) in 2014, his studio albums, including 2022's A Ragged Ghost, have resembled cinematic ambient experiences.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJesse Reiner\n\n\n== Past Members ==\nJohn Pamer\nAngus Tarnawsky\nPhil Manley\nDiego Gonzalez\nWarren Huegel\nDamon Palermo\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\"Modern By Nature's Reward EP\" (Kranky 2008)\nJonas Reinhardt (Kranky, 2008)\nPowers of Audition (Kranky, 2010)\n\"Manoeuvers 7\"\" (Kraak, 2011)\nMusic for the Tactile Dome (Not Not Fun Records, 2011)\n\"The Prime Revealer 12\"\" (Great Pop Supplement, 2011)\n\"Foam Fangs EP\" (100% Silk, 2012)\n\"Rusting Ciphers of a Forgotten Sky\" (VCO Cassettes, 2012)\nMask of the Maker (Not Not Fun Records, 2013)\nPalace Savant (Further Records, 2015)\nThe Encyclopedia of Civilizations Vol. 1: Egypt (w/Jurgen Mueller) (Abstracke Records, 2017)\nConclave Surge (Deep Distance, 2018)\nGonzalez & Reinhardt (Stimulus Progression, 2018)\nGonzalez & Reinhardt: Entropy Brothers (Lucian Lift, 2019)\nA Ragged Ghost (Trouble In Mind, 2022)\n\n\n== References ==\nReview, Allmusic\nInterview, XLR8R TV\nArticle, Exclaim!\nReview, Dusted Magazine\nReview, PopMatters\nArticle, San Francisco Weekly"

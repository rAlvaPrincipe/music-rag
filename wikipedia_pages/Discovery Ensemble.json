    "text": "Discovery Ensemble was a Boston-based chamber orchestra founded by Music Director Courtney Lewis and Artistic Director David St. George. The orchestra, made up of young professionals from the Boston area, gave its inaugural concert in October 2008. It disappeared from the Boston music scene after an announcement cancelling the already advertised 2014 season.\nDiscovery Ensemble had two missions. It was a chamber orchestra that performed to local acclaim in the Boston Globe and the Boston Phoenix. Concerts took place at Sanders Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nDiscovery Ensemble's second mission was education. The orchestra presented four Discovery Programs per year, each consisting of two in-school workshops and a matinee concert for children from local schools. The schools' concerts took place at Strand Theatre in Dorchester, Massachusetts.\nDiscovery Ensemble played live regularly on WGBH Radio and was featured as Critics' Choice on NPR. In December 2009, Pulitzer Prize–winning critic Lloyd Schwartz of the Boston Phoenix named Discovery Ensemble Boston's \"Best Kept Secret\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe orchestra played its first concert in October 2008 in the Strand Theatre, Dorchester with Ginastera's Variaciones concertantes, Stravinsky's Danses concertantes, and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.\nThe orchestra was founded because directors Courtney Lewis and David St. George saw the possibility, given the abundance of young professional musicians in Boston, of forming and training a large (40 players) chamber orchestra that could perform at the highest international level.\nDiscovery Ensemble was particularly associated with schools and community centers in Dorchester.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nBoston Globe 1 Ensemble Shows Exuberance from the Start\nBoston Globe 2 Courtney Lewis and Discovery Ensemble Help Make Classical Accessible\nBoston Phoenix 1 Anniversaries and Other Occasions\nBoston Phoenix 2 Springer vs. Nero\nBoston Phoenix 3 The Roar of the Crowd\nBoston Phoenix 4 2009: The Year in Classical\nBoston Intelligencer Harbison \"Bout of Un-relatedness\" Between Two Chestnuts\nDorchester Reporter Orchestra Helps Young People Discover Classical Music\nWBUR A Young Maestro’s Noble Experiment: Classical Music For All\nWBUR A Young Conductor Leads A Noble Experiment\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscovery Ensemble Website Archived 22 October 2013 at the Wayback Machine\nCourtney Lewis Website\nArtsBoston Entry Archived 25 July 2011 at the Wayback Machine\nMinnesota Orchestra\nDiscovery Ensemble YouTube Page\nInstantEncore\nVimeo"

    "text": "Klubbheads is a team of dance music producers and DJs from the Netherlands. They have more than 40 aliases for their recordings, including Hi_Tack, DJ Disco and Drunkenmunky.\n\n\n== History ==\nKoen Groeneveld (DJ Boozy Woozy) and Addy van der Zwan (Itty Bitty) first worked together in the Turn Up the Bass series of commercial mixes. They started producing music in the 1990s before meeting up with Jan Voermans (Greatski) in 1995. The trio created the sublabel Blue Records for parent Mid-Town Records to release their tracks as Klubbheads. In 1996, they had their first mainstream chart hit with \"Klubbhopping\", which reached #10 in the UK Singles Chart in May. It was followed up with two other entries into the top 40, in August 1997 with \"Discohopping\" (#35) and in August 1998 with \"Kickin' Hard\" (#36). In 1999, they co-produced \"The Launch\" for compatriot DJ Jean, reaching #2 in September. At this time they also split up from Blue Records to found the label Digidance.\nThey scored a Billboard Hot Dance Airplay hit in 2003 with \"E\" (which samples Eminem's \"Without Me\") under the Drunkenmunky name. In other countries, it was released under the title \"E (As in Eveline)\" without the use of the \"Without Me\" sample. Their song \"Yeah!\" samples the crunk hit \"Yeah!\" by Usher to a similar success. In 2005, they sampled Rune RK's \"Calabria\" under the name Dirty Laundry.\nAs Hi_Tack, they have released a remix of \"Say Say Say\" in 2006, a track originally by Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson (now renamed to \"Say Say Say (Waiting 4 U)\"), which reached #4 on the UK Singles Chart. The track entered Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in the United States, where it debuted at #18 for the week ending 6 March 2006. They have also remixed Filter Funk's cover of the Police song, \"Message in a Bottle\".\nVoermans elected to end their partnership in the spring of 2005 after ten years of collaboration. Groeneveld and van der Zwan continue to work together under a new label, Unit 54, while Voermans remains with Digidance.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Klubbheads ===\n\n\n=== Drunkenmunky ===\n\n\n=== Hi_Tack ===\n\n\n=== 3 Dubbs in a Sleeve ===\n1996 \"Volume 1\"\n1997 \"Volume 2\"\n2000 \"Klubbin' And Dubbin' EP\"\n2000 \"Full Dubb Boogie EP\"\n\n\n=== Bamboo Sessions ===\n2003 \"Bamboo Sessions #1\"\n2004 \"Bamboo Sessions #2\"\n2004 \"Bamboo Sessions #3\"\n2004 \"Bamboo Sessions #4\"\n2005 \"Bamboo Sessions #5\"\n\n\n=== B.I.G. ===\n1997 \"The DJ Files 1 EP\"\n1999 \"The DJ Files 2\"\n2002 \"Peak Hour Insanity\"\n2004 \"Break Dance Electric Boogie\"\n\n\n=== Cab'n'Crew ===\n1998 \"Disarm Slidebars EP\"\n1998 \"The Flying Dutchman EP\"\n1999 \"Domestic Turbulence EP\"\n1999 \"Pure (Aviation)/Cab 'N' Pressure\"\n2000 \"Cityhopping\"\n\n\n=== Code Blue ===\n1996 \"Bonkers EP\"\n1997 \"More Bonkers EP\"\n1998 \"Bonkers in Hamburg EP\"\n\n\n=== Da Klubb Kings ===\n1997 \"It's Time 2 Get Funky\"\n1998 \"Don't Stop\"\n1999 \"Everybody Pump It\"\n2001 \"La Di Da Di\"\n2001 \"Let's Go\"\n2002 \"Two Thumbs Up!\"\n2004 \"Neh Neh Oh Neh Neh\"\n2005 \"Welcum to the Good Ol'Days EP\"\n\n\n=== Da Techno Bohemian ===\n1996 \"Bangin' Bass\"\n1997 \"Pump The Bass\"\n1998 \"Bangin' Bass '98\"\n2002 \"Bangin' Wit A Gang of Instrumentals\"\n2002 \"Droppin' The Instrumentals\"\n2002 \"Pump The Bass 2002\"\n\n\n=== DJ BoozyWoozy ===\n\n\n=== DJ Disco ===\n1997 \"Da Techno Bohemian Presents Dirty Disco Dubs\"\n1998 \"Stamp Your Feet\"\n1999 \"Let's Dance\"\n1999 \"Dirty Disco Dubs 2\"\n1999 \"Reach 2 The Top/Superfreak\"\n2003 \"Get Up\"\n2005 \"Stamp Your Feet (2005 Remixes)\"\n\n\n=== Greenfield ===\n1995 \"No Silence\"\n1998 \"The Wicked Club Sandwich EP\"\n1998 \"Violet Club Sandwich\"\n1999 \"Forever\"\n2001 \"Took Away My Love/The Moment\"\n2004 \"Les Sons D'Amour\"\n2006 \"Test\"\n\n\n=== Itty Bitty Boozy Woozy/IttyBitty, BoozyWoozy & Greatski ===\n1995 \"Tempo Fiesta (Party Time)\" (UK chart #34, November 1995)\n1997 \"Luv Song\"\n1997 \"Pumped Up Funk\"\n\n\n=== J.A.K. ===\n1999 \"I'm Gonna Dis You\"\n2000 \"Everybody in Da Place!\"\n2001 \"The Rap\"\n\n\n=== Rollercoaster ===\n1997 \"Keep It Goin'\"\n1998 \"Keep The Frequency Clear\"\n1999 \"Come With Me\"\n2001 \"Don't Hold Me Back\"\n2004 \"Damn\"\n\n\n=== Trancemission ===\n1990 \"No More Mindgames\"\n1991 \"Trancemission (Rock Da House)\"\n1992 \"The Pollution EP\"\n1993 \"Inner Joy\"\n\n\n=== The Ultimate Seduction ===\n1992 \"The Ultimate Seduction\"\n1992 \"House Nation\"\n1993 \"Ba Da Da Na Na Na\"\n1994 \"Together Forever (You & Me)\"\n1996 \"The Ultimate Seduction/Organ Seduction '96)\"\n1997 \"A Waking Nightmare\"\n1999 \"Get Down And Party\"\n2001 \"The Ultimate Seduction 2001\"\n2001 \"It's Time To Jam\"\n2004 \"The Ultimate Seduction 2004\"\n\n\n=== Other aliases ===\n1991 \"Metamorphism\", as KA-22\n1991 \"Vol. 1\", as The Sound of Now\n1992 \"Jump A Little Hi-er\", as 2 Hi\n1993 \"I Need You Lovin' (Like The Sunshine)\", as Infectious\n1993 \"Carnival of Sounds\", as KA-22\n1993 \"Helemaal Cut\", as Cut The Cake\n1993 \"Boom!

    "text": "Nice Girl Project! (NICE GIRL プロジェクト！), often shortened to NGP, was a Japanese idol musical collective formed by Tanabe Agency, Space Craft Group, Up-Front Group, and TNX. The project was created by Tsunku and launched on October 15, 2007. Nice Girl Project! began its full-time activities in April 2008.\nBefore its disbandment, the project's roster consisted of groups The Possible, Canary Club; soloists Tokky and Mana Ogawa; and the trainee group, Nice Girl Project! Kenshusei. The project also consisted of groups Nice Girl Mu (ナイスガールμ), GTT Club (GTT倶楽部), and MM Gakuen Gasshoubu (ＭＭ学園 合唱部); and soloists Kafumio (何文櫻), Peach (Momoko Otsuka), and Karen Kato prior to their disbandment or departure.\nNice Girl Project! was dropped as an act in 2015 and all information and social media was removed from TNX's official website. In the same year, one of their flagship groups, The Possible, was renamed \"Ciao Bella Cinquetti\" and transferred to Up-Front Works.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2007, Tsunku created Nice Girl Project! a collaboration between Tanabe Agency, Space Craft Group, Up-Front Group, and TNX, where TNX founded as a base to manage activities. Comparing it as a \"twin\" project to the musical collective Hello! Project, the project's first founding groups were The Possible, trainees from Hello! Project's trainee program Hello Pro! Eggs; and Canary Club from Space Craft Agency. Tsunku had intended on Nice Girl Project! having their own television program.\nIn 2015, Nice Girl Project!'s activities ended, with all information and social media from Nice Girl Project! removed from TNX's official website. The Possible was renamed \"Ciao Bella Cinquetti\" and transferred to Up-Front Works, while the rest of the acts were dropped.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\n[2007.12.19] あぁ　女子合唱部～栄光のかけら～ (Aa Joshi Gasshou bu ~Eikou no Kake ra~)\n[2008.02.28] NICE GIRL プロジェクト！　THE ポッシボーとキャナァーリ倶楽部の秘密 (NICE GIRL Project!

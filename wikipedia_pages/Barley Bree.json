In 1977, all except Bryson moved to Nova Scotia; Bryson was replaced by Tom Sweeney. In 1979, O'Hagan returned to Northern Ireland and the band continued on as a trio until 1995, when Tom Sweeney left to pursue a solo career.\nBarley Bree widely toured North America and released eight successful albums. They also fronted a weekly television series called Barley Bree which lasted for two years. After breaking up, they reunited several times at the Milwaukee Irish Fest.\nBarley Bree appeared with Tommy Makem and Cherish the Ladies on the 1992 CD and video, Tommy Makem and Friends in Concert.\nNova Scotia musician Brian Doherty (of Evans & Doherty) joined the band as their recording bass player in 1985.

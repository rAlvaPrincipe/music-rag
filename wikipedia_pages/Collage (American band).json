    "text": "Collage was a Los Angeles-based music group, best known for their crossover song \"Romeo Where's Juliet?\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nCollage's debut album Do You Like Our Music?, released in 1981 by Solar Records, was produced by the Whispers. Their next album Get In Touch was typified by the change from disco/funk elements found in the first album to boogie-influenced urban music. Before Collage's departure from the music business they also released album entitled Shine The Light, which also features \"Romeo Where's Juliet?\".\nThe \"real\" success, however, came with the release of \"Romeo Where's Juliet?\", which was a moderate  hit in the United Kingdom. The single reached number 46 on the British pop chart and number 49 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\n\n\n== Past members ==\nAlbert De Gracia - Fender Rhodes, piano\nDean Boysen - trumpet, flugelhorn\nEmilio Conesa - electric guitar, acoustic guitar\nDavid Agent - bass\nKirk Crumpler - bass\nLarry White - electric guitar\nLee Peters - background vocals, lead vocals\nMelicio Magdaluyo - saxophone, flute\nRichard Aguon - drums, percussion\nRuben Laxamana - saxophone, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCollage at Discogs."

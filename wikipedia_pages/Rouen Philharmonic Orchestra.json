    "text": "The Rouen Philharmonic Orchestra (French: Orchestre de l'Opéra de Rouen Normandie) is a symphony orchestra based in Rouen in Normandy, France. It is housed in the Rouen Opera House.\nFounded in 1998 by Austrian conductor Oswald Sallaberger, the orchestra is one of France's leading musical institutions. British conductor Ben Glassberg was offered the conductorship and his appointment was effective from the commencement of the 2020–2021 season.\n\n\n== Orchestra ==\nOverview\nThe orchestra was formed in 1998 by Oswald Sallaberger in an endeavour to organize a professional orchestra in the city of Rouen.\nBased on a Mozart formation, the orchestra is made up of more than 40 permanent musicians. It is often reinforced by additional non-permanent artists, enriching the breadth of the orchestra and allowing for special musical programs and events requiring a larger ensemble.\nThe orchestra is alternately conducted by its current musical director, Leo Hussain, or by local and foreign guest conductors who impulse a continuously renewed and refreshed approach to music.\nRepertoire\nThe orchestra's scope ranges from Baroque music to contemporary music. They notably performed Wagner's Der fliegende Holländer and Britten's Curlew River.\nSpecificity\nThe orchestra also organizes concerts requiring catgut strings instruments and traditional bows, offering musicians the opportunity to fully express their talents. The orchestra also highly encourages its musicians to further develop their technicality and widen their personal scope by programming concerts of chamber music and allowing them to perform as soloists. It is France's first orchestra to offer that alternative.\nInternational recognition\nIt holds musical performances worldwide, either in Normandy, in other regions of France or in overseas countries. The orchestra has toured to cities such as Bruges, Brussels, Delhi, Hanover, Havana, Luxembourg, New York City and Paris. The orchestra benefits from international recognition and was acclaimed on numerous occasions for the professionalism displayed in its rendition of musical masterpieces.\n\n\n== Musical direction ==\n\n\n=== Current directorship ===\nBen Glassberg was appointed conductor of the orchestra upon the termination of Hussain's contract. The orchestra's founding director, Oswald Sallaberger, is still closely involved in the running of the musical institution.\n\n\n=== Former directors ===\n1998–2011 : Oswald Sallaberger (Austrian)\n2011–2014 : Luciano Acocella (Italian)\n2014–2020 : Leo Hussain (British)\n\n\n== Guest conductors ==\n\n\n=== Current guest conductors ===\n\n\n=== Former guest conductors ===\n2002–2005 : David Stern, principal guest conductor (American)\n\n\n== Musicians ==\n\n\n=== Permanent musicians ===\nviolin\n\nJane Peters, leader (Australian)\nTeona Kharadze, principal second violin (Georgian)\nHervé Walczak Le Sauder, principal second violin (French)\nTristan Benveniste, co-leader second violin (French)\nHélène Bordeaux, violin (French)\nElena Chesneau, violin (Russian)\nNathalie Demarest, violin\nAlice Estienne-Hotellier, violin (French)\nEtienne Hotellier, violin (French)\nMarc Lemaire, violin (French)\nElena Pease, violin\nLaurent Soler, violin (French)\nPascale Thiébaux, violin (French)\nViola\n\nPatrick Dussart, soloist viola\nAgathe Blondel, soloist viola (French)\nThierry Corbier, viola (French)\nStéphanie Lalizet, viola (French)\nCédric Rousseau, viola (French)\nCello\n\nFlorent Audibert, soloist cello (French)\nAnaël Rousseau, soloist cello (French)\nJacques Perez, cello (French)\nHélène Latour, cello (French)\nBass\n\nGwendal Etrillard, soloist bass (French)\nBaptiste Andrieu, bass (French)\nFlute\n\nJean-Christophe Falala, soloist flute (French)\nKouchyar Shahroudi, flute (Iranian)\nOboe\n\nJérôme Laborde, soloist oboe (French)\nFabrice Rousson, oboe (French)\nClarinet\n\nNaoko Yoshimura, soloist clarinet (Japanese)\nFlorianne Tardy, clarinet\nBassoon\n\nBatiste Arcaix, soloist bassoon (French)\nHorn\n\nPierre-Olivier Goll, soloist horn (French)\nEric Lemardeley, horn (French)\nTrumpet\n\nFranck Paque, soloist trumpet (French)\nPatrice Antonangelo, trumpet (French)\nTimpani\n\nPhilippe Bajard, soloist timpani (French)\nSource:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

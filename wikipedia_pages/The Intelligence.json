    "text": "The Intelligence is an American rock band from Seattle, formed in 1999. Founded by multi-instrumentalist Lars Finberg (A Frames, Thee Oh Sees), the band currently consists of Finberg, alongside Dave Hernandez (guitar), Drew Church (bass) and Kaanan Tupper (drums).\nTo date, the band has released nine studio albums, two EPs and a number of singles, the latter often split with other artists.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe Intelligence was formed by Lars Finberg. Since the late 1990s Finberg played in other bands with vocalist/guitarist Erin Sullivan, and bassist Min Yee (the Dipers, Unnatural Helpers).\nA-Frames and the Intelligence started in 1999. Both acts released singles on Dragnet Records, the indie label Finberg runs with A-Frames members Erin Sullivan and Min Yee.\nThe Intelligence's first release was a 5 track 7-inch EP entitled Girlfriends and Boyfriends on Dragnet Records in 2000. Three years later, two tracks featured on a split 7-inch with the Popular Shapes on Dirtnap Records. This was followed by the two track \"Test\" 7-inch on S-S Records in 2003. The following year, Finberg recorded some songs at home and with other musicians that were released on their debut album Boredom And Terror. It was released as vinyl with an extra CD, the latter tracks were re-released on vinyl by Polly Maggoo in 2006. After their debut, The Intelligence got signed to In the Red Records who released their second album Icky Baby in 2005. In 2006 the four-track EP Boys Annoy 12-inch was released.\nThe band opened two shows for The Fall at CMJ. The Intelligence first toured in Europe in 2006.\nCountry Teasers bassist Kaanan Tupper joined the band supporting the 2007 LP, Deuteronomy.\nIn 2009, the band released Fake Surfers, featuring a number of guest vocalists and produced by Mike McHugh. They also released Crepuscule With Pacman on the French label Born Bad Records.\nTowards the end of the decade, Finberg had moved away from lo-fi recordings made by himself to studio-productions. In 2010, the band released their seventh album, Males. It was recorded with Karate Party/FM Knives guitarist, Chris Woodhouse who joined The Intelligence as a second guitarist. It was followed in 2012 with Everybody’s Got It Easy But Me.\nIn 2014, the record company re-released both the debut album Boredom and Terror and the content of the original bonus CD on vinyl. In 2015, the band released Vintage Future, and toured as support to FFS in September/October.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nBoredom and Terror (2004)\nIcky Baby (2005)\nDeuteronomy (2007)\nFake Surfers (2009)\nCrepuscule with Pacman (2009)\nMales (2010)\nEverybody’s Got It Easy But Me (2012)\nVintage Future (2015)\nUn-Psychedelic in Peavey City (2019)\nEPs\n\nGirlfriends and Boyfriends (2000)\nLet's Toil (2006)\nBoys Annoy (2007)\nSingles\n\nTest/Bird Call 7-inch (S-S Records, 2004)\nI'm Your Taxi/No Nurses/If I Had A Hammer 7-inch (Holy Cobra Society, 2006)\nMessage Of Love/Leopard Skin Pill Box Hat 7-inch (Disordered Records/Lo-Fi Records, 2007)\nDebt & ESP/Chateau Bandit 7-inch (Plastic Idol Records, 2008)\nFido, Your Leash Is Too Long/Shitty World (Plastic Idol Records, 2008)\nWhat Wine Goes With Eggs?/Sixteen & Seventeen (April 77 Records, 2008)\nReading and Writing About Partying/Like Like Like Like Like Like Like 7-inch (Raw Deluxe Records, 2009)\nSplits\n\nsplit 7-inch with Popular Shapes (Dirtnap Records, 2003)\nsplit 12-inch EP with The Ohsees (MT.

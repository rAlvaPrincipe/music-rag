    "text": "The Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra (KSO, Norwegian: Kristiansand Symfoniorkester) is a Norwegian  symphony orchestra based in Kristiansand.  The KSO performs its concerts primarily at the Kilden Performing Arts Centre, and also at Kristiansand Cathedral.  The KSO is administratively based at the Kilden Performing Arts Centre.\n\n\n== History ==\nOne of the orchestra's precursor ensembles was the Kristiansand Byorkester, founded in 1919.  The Byorkester was then an amateur orchestra with some professional musicians in the ranks.  Gunnar Abrahamsen, a cathedral organist, was the orchestra's first principal conductor, In the 1980s, the Kristiansand Chamber Orchestra formally was established, as a professional string orchestra.\nIn 2003, the Kristiansand Chamber Orchestra and the Armed Forces Band of Southern Norway (which had its roots back to 1818) merged to form the present KSO.  Under the new arrangement, the KSO preserves traditions from before the merger, in that the strings act as Kristiansand Chamber Orchestra and woodwinds under the name of the Kristiansand Blåseensemble. \nDuring the chief conductorship of Rolf Gupta (2006–2012), the KSO took up its current residence at the Kilden Performing Arts Centre, in January 2012.  Giordano Bellincampi was chief conductor from 2013 to 2018, and now has the title of æresdirigent (honorary conductor) of the KSO.  Since 2018, the KSO's chief conductor is Nathalie Stutzmann, the first female conductor ever to be chief conductor of the KSO.  Her current contract with the KSO is through 2023.  In November 2022, the KSO announced that Stutzmann is to stand down as its chief conductor at the close of the 2022-2023 season.\nJulian Rachlin became principal guest conductor of the KSO in 2018.  In April 2021, the KSO announced the appointment of Tabita Berglund as its next principal guest conductor, effective 1 August 2021, with an initial contract of three seasons.  In November 2022, the KSO announced the appointment of Rachlin as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2023-2024 season.\n\n\n== Chief conductors (partial list) ==\nGunnar Abrahamsen (1919–1921)\nRolf Balchen (1945–1950s)\nHeinz Freudenthal (1969–1973)\nJon Robertson (1979–1987)\nTerje Boye Hansen (2001–2006)\nRolf Gupta (2006–2013)\nGiordano Bellincampi (2013-2018)\nNathalie Stutzmann (2018–2023)\nJulian Rachlin (2023–present)\n\n\n== Artistic leaders for Kristiansand Chamber Orchestra (partial list) ==\nStephan Barratt-Due (1990–1996)\nJan Stigmer (1996–2003)\nPierre Amoyal (2007–2010)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra\nStore Norske Lexikon page on the Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra"

    "text": "Rev. from DVL was a Japanese idol girl group formed in 2011, as a successor to vocal and dance group DVL. It was formed as a local idol group for major activities within Fukuoka Prefecture, and was managed under ActiveHakata.\n\n\n== History ==\nRev. from DVL originated from a co-ed dance and vocal group formed in 2003, initially under the name \"DVL\", which stands for \"dance\", \"vocal\" and \"love\", but in 2011, with the rise in idol groups in Japan, it reformed as a girl group, and was renamed \"Rev. from DVL\", with \"Rev.\" being the short form for \"revolution\", signifying the evolution from DVL's revolution concept.\nShortly after its formation, the group was to originally participate in activities within Fukuoka Prefecture. However, between October and November 2013, a photograph of Kanna Hashimoto went viral on the Internet, causing her and the group to achieve a higher level of popularity.\nIn June 2014, under Yoshimoto R and C, Rev. from DVL released their first single, \"LOVE-arigatou-\". With 13,000 original copies sold, it ranked sixth place on the weekly Oricon Singles Chart. Since then, the group released more singles, and had their own radio and television programs, and their popularity spread from Fukuoka Prefecture to the whole of Japan.\nOn February 6, 2017, Rev. from DVL announced that it would disband on March 31, 2017. They released their album, NEVER SAY GOODBYE -arigatou, and held a final pair of concerts in Tokyo and Fukuoka, on March 29 and March 31 respectively, prior to their disbandment.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nMiki Washio (鷲尾美紀, Washio Miki) (2003-2017)\nNagisa Shinomiya (四宮なぎさ, Shinomiya Nagisa) (2006-2017)\nHitomi Imai (今井瞳, Imai Hitomi) (2007-2017)\nMiho Akiyama (秋山美穂, Akiyama Miho) (2007-2017)\nKanna Hashimoto (橋本環奈, Hashimoto Kanna) (2009-2017)\nNanami Takahashi (高橋菜々美, Takahashi Nanami) (2009-2016)\nYuna Nishioka (西岡優菜, Nishioka Yūna) (2009-2016)\nNanami Chikaraishi (力石奈波, Chikaraishi Nanami) (2010-2017)\nHonami Kamiya (神谷帆南, Kamiya Honami) (2010-2016)\nKyoka Motono (本野杏香, Motono Kyōka) (2011-2015)\nYukina Hashimoto (橋本幸奈, Hashimoto Yukina) (2012-2017)\nReina Fujimoto (藤本麗依菜, Fujimoto Reina) (2012-2017)\nSaki Furusawa (古澤早希, Furusawa Saki) (2014-2017)\nAiri Ikematsu (池松愛理, Ikematsu Airi) (2015-2017)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Japanese)"

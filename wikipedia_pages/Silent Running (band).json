    "text": "Silent Running are a Northern Irish rock band, who emerged from the Belfast punk scene and were originally called The Setz, before changing musical direction in 1982. The original band members were Richard Collett (bass, born 31 March 1960), Peter Gamble (vocals, born 24 November 1960), Tony Scott (guitars) and Ian Gault (drums). Prior to signing to EMI, the band recruited George Beavis on keyboards.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe first single recorded, \"All the King's Men\"/\"When the 12th of Never Comes\", was a 300-copy promotional only release which led to a session for BBC Radio 1 following interest from Peter Powell.\nShortly afterwards, the band signed with EMI Records and released the single \"When the 12th of Never Comes\".\nThe band recorded tracks such as \"Speed of Life\" for the proposed first album, although Beavis was subsequently dismissed and replaced with Alex White. The resulting album was Shades of Liberty which received a five star review in Melody Maker headlined \"Silent Classic\". Singles such as \"Young Hearts\" and \"Sticks and Stones\" both failed to reach the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, and the band never achieved the desired breakthrough.\n\n\n== Shades of Liberty ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nPrior to signing to EMI, Silent Running recruited George Beavis on keyboards and together the band recorded tracks such as \"Speed of Life\" for their proposed first album. However, Beavis was subsequently dismissed and replaced with Alex White. The line-up then recorded Shades of Liberty. Three singles were released from the album: \"Emotional Warfare\", \"Young Hearts\", and \"Sticks and Stones\". Despite attempts to gain commercial success, the band never achieved the desired breakthrough. \"Young Hearts\" was the only single to make a chart appearance in the UK, where it reached No. 92. Shades of Liberty failed to chart. Both \"Young Hearts\" and \"Sticks and Stones\" were released within the UK and Europe only, while \"Emotional Warfare\" was released in America and Europe.\nShades of Liberty was the band's only album release for EMI. A second album for EMI was planned and the single \"No Faith is Blind\" preceded it in 1985. However, the limited success of the single resulted in the label cancelling the second album and dropping the band. They would sign to Atlantic Records after, where they would record two albums.\n\n\n=== Recording ===\nThe album was recorded at both The Manor and Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin, while it was mixed at The Manor and Air Studios. It was recorded during January–February 1984.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nThe album was released by EMI Records in the UK, Europe and North America. In America and Canada, the album was titled Emotional Warfare, after the leading (and only American) single. The release featured slightly different front artwork, with a black background replacing the white of the European sleeve. The back artwork on the European and North America editions are completely different. The album has not seen a CD release, except an unofficial one by the Lost 80s Record Company in 2013.\n\n\n=== Promotion ===\nA music video was filmed to promote the \"Emotional Warfare\" and \"Young Hearts\" singles. In 1984, the band appeared on UK TV show The Tube, where they performed \"Emotional Warfare\" and \"Sticks and Stones\". On the German TV show Musik Convoy, the band performed \"Young Hearts\".\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n\nUpon release, the album received a five out of five star review in the Melody Maker magazine headlined \"Silent Classic\". In the American magazine Billboard, Shades of Liberty was included under the 'Recommended' section of the 'Pop' albums section. The magazine described the album as \"U2-style wall of sound to a disco beat.\"\n\n\n=== Chart performance ===\n\n\n==== Singles ====\nYoung Hearts\n\n\n=== Personnel ===\nPeter Gamble – vocals\nTony Scott – guitar\nAlex White – keyboards\nRichard Collett – bass\nIan Gault – drums\n\n\n==== Additional personnel ====\nPeter Walsh – producer, engineer\nJif – assistant engineer at Air\nSteve Chase – assistant engineer at The Manor\nKevin Killen – assistant engineer at Windmill Lane\nDesign RX – The Creative Department Ltd. – sleeve artwork\nUrsula Steiger – photography\n\n\n=== EMI ===\nThe second album on EMI was prefaced with the release of the double A-side single \"No Faith Is Blind\"/\"Business as Usual\". Despite airplay and appearances on television shows across the musical spectrum (including Cheggers Plays Pop), the single only charted at No. 85 in the UK resulting in the band being dropped by EMI.  This led to the situation of their second album on EMI getting cancelled before its designated release date.\nIn a major coup, the band were subsequently picked up by Atlantic Records, becoming the first Irish act to join the roster of this American record label.\nWhite left in 1985 to work with Joan Armatrading, resulting in the band relying on session musicians such as Adrian Lee (Mike + The Mechanics), Clive Gates (New Musik) and Ian Curnow (Talk Talk; he was not really a stranger to the band, since he had already played keyboards on their 1983 debut single) to record the next two albums (Walk on Fire and Deep).\n\n\n== Walk on Fire ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nAfter the commercial failure of the band's 1984 debut album Shades of Liberty and its three singles, the band were to record their second album for EMI Records. However, the 1985 single \"No Faith is Blind\" failed to become a commercial success. Despite massive airplay and appearances on television shows across the musical spectrum (including 'Cheggar's Plays Pop') the single resulted in the band being dropped by EMI.\nIn a major coup the band were picked up by Atlantic Records, becoming the first British or Irish act to join the roster of this legendary American record label.\nA total of two singles were released from the album; \"Sanctuary\" and \"Heartland\", which both failed to make enough impact to chart, causing the band to not make the elusive breakthrough that was hoped.\n\"Sanctuary\" was released in both the UK and America. The artwork for the single used the main artwork for the album. \"Heartland\" was released during 1988 in the UK only although it was also released as an American promotional single. The single featured non-related artwork to the album.\n\n\n=== Recording ===\nThe album was produced and engineered by British-Canadian producer Terry Brown, although two tracks, \"Walk on Fire\" and \"Till Tomorrow Comes\", were produced by Andy Richards and engineered by Tony Phillips. All tracks are original, where the music was written by all four members of the band, with the lyrics being written solely by vocalist Peter Gamble.\nKeyboardist Alex White left in 1985 to work with Joan Armatrading, resulting in the band relying on session musicians such as Ian Curnow (Talk Talk) to record keyboards on the album.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nWalk on Fire was released by Atlantic Records in North America, Europe and Australia. The album was made available on all streaming platforms by Warner Music on 23 July 2021.\n\n\n=== Promotion ===\nA music video was created for the single \"Sanctuary\".\nA European mini-poster advertisement for the album was issued for magazines.\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nFollowing the commercial failure of the album, the band would work on their next album for Atlantic Records, the 1989 album Deep.\n\n\n=== Personnel ===\nPeter Gamble – vocals, lyrics\nTony Scott – guitar\nRichard Collett – bass\nIan Gault – drums, drum programming\n\n\n==== Additional personnel ====\nTerry Brown – Producer, Engineer\nAndy Richards – Producer on \"Walk on Fire\" and \"Till Tomorrow Comes\", Keyboards\nTony Phillips – Engineer on \"Walk on Fire\" and \"Till Tomorrow Comes\"\nJames Reynolds – Assistant Engineer\nRen Swan – Assistant Engineer\nTrevor Hallesy – Engineer\nIan Curnow – Keyboards\nClive Griffin, Helena Spriggs, Linda Taylor, Shirley Lewis, Tessa Niles – Backing Vocals\n\n\n== Deep ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nDeep was the band's second album for Atlantic Records, and the third studio album, released in 1989.\nWith the release of Deep, the band toured extensively but disbanded shortly after, citing a lack of record company support.\nBoth \"Deep in the Heart of Nowhere\" and \"Local Hero\" were released as promotional CD singles in the US.\n\n\n=== Recording ===\nThe first four tracks of the album were produced by the band themselves with Frankie LaRocka and Peter Denenberg, who both engineered the album. The rest of the tracks were produced by John Eden, whilst LaRocka and Deneberg remixed the tracks produced by Eden. The album was LaRocka's first attempt at production work, where he also played drums on part of the album. Originally, LaRocka had signed the band while working in the A&R department at Atlantic Records.\nDrummer Ian Gault departed the band after the initial recording of Deep in 1988 and was therefore replaced by Gary Kirby. Around the same time, Paul Rocks joined the band on keyboards, and the band finished recording the Deep album in New York.\nPrior to Paul Rocks joining, the previous keyboardist Alex White had left the group back in 1985 to work with Joan Armatrading, resulting in the band relying on session musicians such as Adrian Lee (Mike + The Mechanics) and Clive Gates (New Music and Ian Curnow, Talk Talk.\nAll tracks are original, where the music was written by all three main members of the band; vocalist Peter Gamble, bassist Richard Collett and guitarist Tony Scott, discounting new members Kirby and Rocks, with the lyrics being written solely by vocalist Peter Gamble. Some tracks featured a writing credit to Gault, as they were completed before he left the group.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nDeep was released by Atlantic Records in the United States and Europe. The album was made available on all streaming platforms by Warner Music on 23 July 2021.\n\n\n==== Critical reception ====\n\nGlorydaze Music wrote, \"Earlier fans of the band would've turned away after their debut, as both Walk on Fire and Deep are quite some way removed from their original direction moulded in the style of Simple Minds and U2. On the other hand, AORsters and melodic rockers would've welcomed them with open arms.\"\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\n\n\n=== Personnel ===\nPeter Gamble – vocals, producer\nTony Scott – guitar, producer\nRichard Collett – bass, Producer\nIan Gault – drums, drum Programming\nGary Kirby – drums\nPaul Rocks – keyboards\n\n\n==== Additional personnel ====\nJohn Eden – producer (tracks 5-10)\nFrankie LaRocka – producer, engineer, remixer, drums\nPeter Denenberg – producer, engineer, remixer\nTom Leinbach – assistant engineer (tracks 1-4)\nClive Gates – keyboards\nAdrian Lee – keyboards\nJoe Bonadio – percussion\nSteve Sidelnyk – percussion\nAdrian Baker, Amy Fradon, Carole Godden, Leslie Ritter – backing vocals\n\n\n== Reunion ==\n\nIn January 2018, the band reunited for the first time in twenty years for a band member's wife's birthday event, augmented by Callum Collett on guitar.\nIn March 2019, Silent Running announced a return to the stage at Belfast venue 'Voodoo' promising songs from all three albums as well as \"showcasing new material\".

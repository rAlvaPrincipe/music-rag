    "text": "Everything Goes Cold is an American industrial band from California. Their lead singer, Eric Gottesman, is notable as a founding member of Industrial Metal band Psyclon Nine, and a live musician with Ayria, Caustic, XP8, Unter Null, and a number of other industrial bands. Everything Goes Cold has released two full-length albums to date, 2009's vs. General Failure (Bit Riot Records,) and 2014's Black Out the Sun (Metropolis Records,) as well as two remix EPs and several digital singles. Both albums met with critical acclaim within the industrial music community. The first album featured guest appearances from Daniel Myer and other industrial luminaries, as well as production by Ted Phelps of Imperative Reaction, and the second was produced by Wade Alin of Christ Analogue and The Atomica Project.\nIn 2011, Everything Goes Cold completed a major US tour with Aesthetic Perfection and Faderhead, and were featured at Festival Kinetik in Montreal. They completed another full US tour with Imperative Reaction, Ludovico Technique, and The Witch Was Right in 2012, and have conducted extensive regional tours in the interim.\nNumerous remixes by Everything Goes Cold have been released, including mixes for 16volt, Terrorfakt, and Ayria. Everything Goes Cold itself has, in turn, been remixed by Dismantled, Hate Dept., SAM, and many more. One of only three remixes ever completed by defunct Los Angeles cult sensation Babyland was for Everything Goes Cold.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nMike Blodgett - Keyboards/Backup Vocals (2009–2011), Drums (2012-present)\nJamie Cronander - Guitar (2014–Present)\nEric Gottesman - Lead Vocals/Programming/Keyboards (2005-present)\nMorgan Tucker - Keyboards (2014–present)\n\n\n=== Former ===\nConan Neutron - Keyboards/Backup Vocals (2008)\nTyler Newman - Keyboards/Backup Vocals (2009)\nKenny Pardo - Drums (2007–2011)\nSam Pfannkuche - Drums (2006)\nJames Webb - Guitar (2006-2014)\nJosh Zero - Keyboards/Backup Vocals (2006–2008, 2012–present)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Releases ===\nPrepare To Be Refrigerated - (CD, EP) 2008 - Sonic Mainline\nFail (Swift & Concise Failure Mix By Out Out) - (Digital) 2008 - Sonic Mainline\nEverything Goes Cold & XP8 Present: The Squidhead Liberation Front, Featuring Battery Cage and Claire Voyant - (Digital) 2008 - No Label\nvs. General Failure - (CD, Album) 2009 - Bit Riot Records\nThe Tyrant Sun - (CD, EP) 2012 - Metropolis Records\nBlack Out The Sun - (CD, Album) 2014 - Metropolis Records\nIAMERROR - (Digital) 2014 - Metropolis Records\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nUnter Null - Your Nightmare (Everything Goes Cold Mix) - Sick Fuck 2005 - Alfa Matrix\nAyria - My Device (Everything Goes Cold Mix) - Flicker (2CD) 2005 - Alfa Matrix\nTerrorfakt - Skullfucker (Everything Goes Cold Remix) - Reworks2: Friendly Fire 2007 - No Label\nLeft Spine Down - Last Daze (Everything Goes Cold Remix) - Smartbomb 2.3: The Underground Mixes 2009 - Synthetic Sounds\nCaustic - BBB (Everything Goes Cold Mix) - Kinetik Festival Volume Two 2009 - Artoffact Records\n16volt - Alkali : Cold - American Porn Songs // Remixed 2010 - Metropolis Records\n\n\n== References =="

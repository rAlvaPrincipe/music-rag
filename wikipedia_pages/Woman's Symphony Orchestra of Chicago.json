    "text": "The Woman's Symphony Orchestra of Chicago was an American orchestra based in Chicago. In addition to its regular radio broadcasts which spanned 1925–1948 (or 1952), the Woman's Symphony Orchestra of Chicago also toured.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe orchestra was founded in 1925 by flutist Adeline Schmidt, cellist Lois Bichl, and clarinetist Lillian Poenisch. Like most industries of the era, women were barred from participating in most professional orchestras throughout the mid-20th century. Nonetheless, in 1924, a year before the Woman's Symphony Orchestra of this article was founded, another one with nearly the same name was founded by Elena Moneak, which lasted until 1928. (see Disambiguation section, below)\nSchmidt, Bichl, and Poenisch felt that Moneak's orchestra lacked professionalism from vocational, performance quality, and business management perspectives and aspired to create one. Initially, their overarching organizational objective was to offer professional performing experiences for women artists, which soon included women composers and conductors. The orchestra premiered notable works of women composers and showcased the artistry of several acclaimed women conductors. Among other things, the orchestra launched a scholarship program aimed at developing more opportunities for female professional orchestral brass and woodwind musicians.\n\n\n=== Demise of the orchestra ===\nThere is some debate about the end of the orchestra. Some music historians have dated the orchestra's termination to its bankruptcy in 1948. However a photo of the orchestra exists dated 1952. The bankruptcy of the Woman's Symphony Orchestra of Chicago is generally known to have been the result of systemic changes following World War II rather than a simple lack of demand for all-female orchestras. As men in the U.S. were drafted in great numbers, often not returning, this resulted in a great demand in previously all-male professional orchestras to recruit female musicians from all female orchestras.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n1925: Organized under charter by the Illinois Secretary of State as the \"Woman's Symphony Orchestral Association\"\nOctober 1925: First rehearsals began\nMay 9, 1926: Inaugural concert in the Goodman Theater\n\n\n== Selected personnel ==\n\n\n=== Founding musicians ===\n\n\n=== Founding non-musicians (patrons) ===\nKathryn Funk (née Kathryn Frances Meeker).

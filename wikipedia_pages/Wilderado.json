The band was first signed to Iamsound Records, but is now signed to Bright Antenna Records.\nWilderado's Max Rainer and Tyler Wimpee met through mutual friends in college and started writing songs together in their fifth year after most of their friends had left. They went on a thirty concert tour with Flipturn in 2022, and expanded the tour to include bands Toledo and Michigander.\nIn 2016, the band released their first EP, Misty Shrub. On July 22, 2016, the band released their second EP titled Latigo which amassed over 18 million streams on Spotify. On the back of Latigo, Wilderado spent the next year touring with acts such as Band of Horses, Rainbow Kitten Surprise, Lindsey Buckingham, and Judah & The Lion.\nIn 2018, Wilderado released their third EP titled Favors to warm critical and fan acclaim. In July 2019, Wilderado released the single Surefire. The song was inspired by the poem “A Gradual Canticle for Augustine” by Tabitha King. Surefire was named one of the \"5 Songs You Need to Hear Right Now\" by Sirius XM's Spectrum.\nIn 2020, the band released 3 singles, CFS, Revenant, and Take Some Time, remixed by RJD2, Emancipator, Kyle McEvoy, & by Gus of Alt-J.\nIn 2021, the band released their newest single, \"Head Right.\" In October of the same year, the band released their debut album self-titled Wilderado.\nIn March, 2022, the band appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, for their television debut.

Originally the band was named \"Bird Dog\" until they learned that another band had been using the name prior to them, which prompted the change to the current name.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nMisty Shrub EP (2016)\nSingles EP (2017)\nLatigo EP (2017)\nFavors EP (2018)\nFavors EP (acoustic) (2018)\n\"Surefire\" (single) (2019) - No. 11 Alternative Airplay\n\"CFS\" (single) (2020)\n\"Revenant\" (single) (2020)\n\"Take Some Time\" (single) (2020)\n\"Head Right\" (single) (2021)\n\"Mr. Major\" (single) (2021)\n\"Wilderado\" (album) (2021)\n\"Talker\" (album) (2024)\n\n\n== References =="

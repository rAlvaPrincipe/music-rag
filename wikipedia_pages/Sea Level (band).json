    "text": "Sea Level was an American rock band from Macon, Georgia. Formed in 1976, the band was an offshoot of the Allman Brothers Band. Between 1977 and 1980, the band released five studio albums which incorporated elements of funk, blues and Latin music.\nSea Level took on a life of its own as tensions grew between Gregg Allman and other members resulting in the loss of two of ABBs founding members. After the Allman Brothers Band broke up when Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts left, the remaining members who evolved into Sea Level were \"We Three\" comprising bassist Lamar Williams, drummer Jaimoe and piano player Chuck Leavell.  The trio would occasionally open shows for the group in 1975 and 1976.  The trio added guitarist Jimmy Nalls and took their name from the phonetic pun of their new bandleader Chuck Leavell's name:  \"C. Leavell.\"  They toured relentlessly, experimenting and refining their sound, eventually signing with Capricorn Records (home of the Allman Brothers) and recording their self-titled debut album in 1977.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nSea Level's music fuses elements of funk, blues, Latin and rock music. A jam band, Sea Level's sound has been classified as southern rock, jazz rock, and funk pop.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter the release of their first album, the group expanded to a septet with the additions of Davis Causey (guitar), George Weaver (drums, percussion) and Randall Bramblett (saxophones, keyboards and vocals). That configuration recorded the group's second album, Cats on the Coast, in 1978 (with the leadoff track, \"That's Your Secret\", reaching #50 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #45 in Canada.)  By the time of the third album, On the Edge, Jaimoe and Weaver had both left, replaced by Joe English.  The sextet of Bramblett, Causey, English, Leavell, Nalls and Williams recorded the fourth album, Long Walk on a Short Pier (1979), unreleased in the United States for nearly twenty years, adding percussionist Matt Greeley for their fifth and final album, Ball Room, issued on Arista in 1980.  Their greatest hits album (CD) wrapped up their body of work, minus a handful of appearances on various compilation albums (mostly Southern Rock).  They were also featured on a 1978 live Southern Rock album which included a live version of \"Grand Larceny.\"\n\n\n== Later years ==\nLeavell later emerged as a much sought-after session musician and producer, touring with Eric Clapton and eventually becoming a \"permanent\" session player touring with the Rolling Stones.\nIn 1998, he issued his debut solo LP, a Christmas album called What's in That Bag? and more recently Forever Blue that includes solo versions of two classic Sea Level compositions: \"Whole Lotta Colada\" and \"Song for Amy.\"  He also released Southscape, an album of Southern anthems that hearkens back to his Southern roots.\nA documentary of Chuck Leavell's career and life outside of music,\"Chuck Leavell: The Tree Man\" IMDb Listing,  directed by Allen Farst IMDb, premiered at Dayton, Ohio's \"The Neon\" theatre on November 6, 2020.

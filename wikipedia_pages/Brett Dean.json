    "text": "Brett Dean (born 23 October 1961) is an Australian composer, violist and conductor.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBrett Dean was born, raised, and educated in Brisbane. He attended Brisbane State High School.\nHe started learning violin at age 8, and later studied viola with Elizabeth Morgan and John Curro at the Queensland Conservatorium, where he graduated in 1982 with the Conservatorium Medal for the highest-achieving student of the year. In 1981 he was a prizewinner in the ABC Symphony Australia Young Performers Awards. \n\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1985 to 1999, Dean was a violist in the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2000, he decided to pursue a freelance career and returned to Australia, where his many appointments have included curating classical music programs with the Sydney Festival (2005) and the Melbourne Festival (2009). As a composer and musician, he is a regularly invited guest to concert stages around the world. He was the composer-in-residence for the Taiwanese National Symphony Orchestra's 2016/17 season and the Creative Chair for the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich's 2017/2018 season.\nDean was artistic director of the Australian National Academy of Music in Melbourne until June 2010, when his brother, Paul, took up the post.\nThe Melbourne Symphony Orchestra celebrated Dean's 50th birthday, and his contribution to music as composer, performer and teacher, in its 2011 Metropolis Festival.\nHe is married to Australian visual artist Heather Betts, and his daughter is the Australian mezzo-soprano Lotte Betts-Dean.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== General ===\nDean began composing in 1988, initially focusing on experimental film and radio projects as well as improvisational performance. Since then, he has created numerous compositions, mainly orchestral or chamber music as well as concertos for several solo instruments. His most successful work is Carlo for strings, sample and tape, inspired by the music of Carlo Gesualdo. On 7 September 2008 his work Polysomnography for wind quintet and piano received its world premiere at the Lucerne Festival; on 2 October 2008 Simon Rattle conducted the first performance of the orchestral song cycle Songs of Joy in Philadelphia. His first opera, Bliss, based on the novel by Peter Carey, premiered at Opera Australia in 2010.\nDean's compositional style is known for creating dynamic soundscapes and treating single instrumental parts with complex rhythms. He shapes musical extremes, from harsh explosions to inaudibility. Modern playing techniques are as characteristic for his style as an elaborate percussion scoring, often enriched with objects from everyday life. Much of Dean's work draws from literary, political or visual stimuli, transporting a non-musical message. Environmental problems are the subject of Water Music and Pastoral Symphony, while Vexations and Devotions deal with the absurdities of a modern society obsessed with information.\nIn April 2013, \"The Last Days of Socrates\" was premiered by the Berlin Philharmonic. The work for bass-baritone, choir, and orchestra was a co-commission of the Rundfunkchor Berlin, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.\nIn August 2014, \"Electric Prelude\" was premiered during the BBC Proms 2014 and was conducted by Sakari Oramo.\n\n\n=== List of compositions ===\n\n\n==== Stage ====\nOne of a Kind – Ballet in three acts for solo cello and tape (1998)\nBliss – Opera (2010)\nHamlet – Opera in two acts (2013–16)\n\n\n==== Orchestra ====\nCarlo – Music for strings, sampler and tape (1997)\nBeggars and Angels Music for orchestra (1999)\nAmphitheatre – Scene for orchestra (2000)\nEtüdenfest for string orchestra with off-stage piano (2000)\nGame over for instrumental soloists, string orchestra and electronics (2000)\nPastoral Symphony for chamber orchestra (2000)\nDispersal for orchestra (2001)\nShadow Music for small orchestra (2002)\nBetween Moments – Music for orchestra, in memory of Cameron Retchford (2003)\nCeremonial for orchestra (2003)\nMoments of Bliss for orchestra (2004)\nParteitag – Music for orchestral groups and video (2004/05)\nShort Stories – Five interludes for string orchestra (2005)\nKomarov's Fall for orchestra (2005/06)\nTestament – Music for orchestra, after version for 12 violas (2008)\nElectric Prelude (2014)\n\n\n==== Concertos ====\nAriel's Music for clarinet and orchestra (1995)\nViola Concerto (2004)\nWater Music for saxophone quartet and chamber orchestra (2004)\nThe Lost Art of Letter Writing for violin and orchestra (2006) – Winner of the 2009 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition.

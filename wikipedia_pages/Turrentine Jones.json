When the band came up with \"Turrentine Jones\", Neville wrote it down.\nAccording to a BBC interview: \"Neville and the band have been cagey about what the name of the act means, and each live interview is an opportunity to dress it up however they feel at the time.\"\n\n\n== Endorsement ==\nTurrentine Jones are endorsed by Rotosound, Peavey and Cornell boutique valve amplifiers.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\nJulian Neville – lead and backing vocals, guitar (2010–present)\nJoe Chilstone-Vause – Bass (2015–present)\nRich Watts – drums, backing vocals, percussion (2012–present)\nTouring members\nThomas Scotson – Hammond organ, keyboard, trumpet (2010–present)\nJaki Chapman – Saxophone (2016–present)\nFormer members\nChris Carcamo – drums (2010–2012)\n\n\n=== Julian Neville ===\n\nJulian Neville (born 14 May 1985) is an Australian recording artist, singer and songwriter. He is the lead vocalist, guitarist, and principal songwriter of Turrentine Jones.\nNeville was born in Waratah, a suburb of Newcastle in Australia and raised in Gloucester, a small rural town in New South Wales. He attended Gloucester High School (1997–2003) and was later described by his Music teacher, Andrew Scully, as \"someone quick to learn, with a natural ear to pick up a guitar and play what he heard. Neville was never particularly vocal, but you could sense when pieces of music moved him.\"\nNeville spent most of his early childhood years listening to soul and early rock and roll citing Booker T & The MG's and The Animals as early influences. Neville turned his attentions to guitar music following the breakthrough of grunge in the 90's. Neville's mother gave him a classical guitar for his birthday when he was 6–7 years old and he began learning.\nIn 2008, Neville left Australia for England having revealed becoming jaded with the local music scene at a young age where he had performed alongside several notable artists including David Knopfler of Dire Straits and Colin Hay of Men at Work. In his own words: \"I gave myself too many distractions and felt I wasn't getting anywhere – Just blasting and laughing my way through the time. It was great. I had fun. But I needed a release\". – Julian Neville.\nNeville moved from Australia to the United Kingdom in 2009, where he had performed as a solo acoustic singer-songwriter supporting the likes of David Knopfler of Dire Straits and Colin Hay of Men at Work.\nNeville's songwriting with Turrentine Jones has been described often as sultry and darkly-sensual, which he matches with wit, warmth and a spoonful or two of suggestion in his lyrics. This is particularly highlighted on the band's first two single releases Le Début and Show Me Mercy.\n\n\n== Equipment ==\n\n\n=== Guitars ===\nFender Telecaster\nFender Jazzmaster – Used on \"Della May\"\nFender Bronco – Used on \"Candy Snake\"\nGibson Les Paul Custom\nCole Clark FL2AC\nTaylor 414CE\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nOur Days (2014)\nLive albums\nLive in York (2015)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Moonlight Is On Yer Side\" (2014, re-released in 2015)\n\"Love Heard You Coming\" (2015)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTurrentine Jones on Facebook"

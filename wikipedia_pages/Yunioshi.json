    "text": "Yunioshi are an electronic rock band from Nottingham, England, formed in October 2006. They describe their sound as \"robot funk\". The name Yunioshi came from I.Y. Yunioshi, a character in Truman Capote's novella, Breakfast at Tiffany's.\nTheir sound was described by TuneTribe as 'the exact place where found sounds and breakbeats merge with left of centre indie pop; all lilting Beck-style rhythms and hummable hooks' and by LeftLion as \"Beck dry humping the Flaming Lips with the robot from Lost In Space looking on and filming all the action for his own personal collection. The perfect pop band. They're as catchy as hell.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nRob Yunioshi (vocals, guitar, keyboards)\nAnna Suzuki Yunioshi (vocals, keyboards, Stylophone and additional instrumentation)\nJames Yunioshi (bass, Roland TB-303)\nHakushi Yunioshi (drums, additional percussion).\n\n\n== History ==\nTheir single, \"Mymo\", was used by Kia for the soundtrack to their UK television advertising campaign Cube for the Kia Carens model between December 2006 and February 2007.\nOther tracks that have been used in advertising include \"Thunderbird\", which was used to advertise South Park on Comedy Central as well as being used numerous times by Sky Sports and Setanta Sports. \"Leisure Rules\" was also used as part of Vauxhall Astra campaign.\nYunioshi were selected by BBC Introducing as a band to look out for. They have recorded sessions at BBC Maida Vale Studios and performed on various BBC Introducing festival stages in the UK. They have appeared live on Tom Robinson's BBC Radio 6 Music show as well as further airplay on Steve Lamacq, Huw Stephens and BBC Local Radio stations. There was a quiz about the band on Stephen Merchant's BBC Radio 6 Music show.\nThey played the Bloom, Summer Sundae and Splendour in Nottingham festivals, in July and August 2009. In 2010 the band played numerous live events in the UK to a growing fan base. Later in the year they went to Reykjav√≠k to play the Iceland Airwaves festival. Upon their return from Iceland they headlined the Hockley Hustle festival at Nottingham Contemporary.\nThey provide cake for their audiences at live shows. They refer to the Yunioshi Catering Corporation as the provider of the cake. There is normally a link to the event or venue in some tenuous way.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Television and advertising ==\n\nKia Carens Cube UK TV Campaign (2006/2007) - \"Mymo\"\nVauxhall Astra campaign (2007/2008) - \"Leisure Rules\"\nSetanta Sports - Harry Redknapp Montage (December 2008) - \"Thunderbird\"\nComedy Central South Park UK TV Campaign (September 2009) - \"Thunderbird\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSteve Lamacq, In New Music We Trust, February 2008, BBC Radio 1\nThe Beat, BBC Radio Nottingham, 5 April 2008\n\n\n== External links ==\nLawford, Nick (November 2006). \"Yunioshi interview\".

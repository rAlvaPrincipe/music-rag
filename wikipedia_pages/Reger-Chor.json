    "text": "The Reger-Chor is a German-Belgian choir. It was founded  in Wiesbaden in 1985 and has been conducted by Gabriel Dessauer in Wiesbaden. Since 2001 it has grown to Regerchor-International in a collaboration with the organist Ignace Michiels of the St. Salvator's Cathedral of Bruges. The choir performs an annual concert both in Germany and Belgium of mostly sacred choral music for choir and organ. Concerts have taken place regularly in St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden, and in the cathedral of Bruges in its series \"Kathedraalconcerten\". The choir performed additional concerts at other churches of the two countries and in the Concertgebouw of Bruges.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nGabriel Dessauer (born 1955) was cantor of St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden, since 1981.

Gabriel Dessauer conducted the choir, Beckschäfer was the organist. He also played his arrangement for organ of Reger's Die Toteninsel, part of Vier Tondichtungen nach A. Böcklin. The concert is considered the foundation of the Reger-Chor.\nThe name was chosen in 1988, when the next project was dedicated to the German premiere of Joseph Jongen's Missa op. 111.

    "text": "The Chelsea Symphony is an orchestra noted for its uniquely fluid hierarchy.  Based in New York City, The Chelsea Symphony's members rotate as the ensembleâ€™s own conductors, composers, and soloists.  Each season, every conductor conducts a complete symphonic program with the group; each composer has a new work performed by the full orchestra; and every soloist performs a featured piece with the entire ensemble.  The Chelsea Symphony gives most of its concerts at the German Church of St. Paul's.\n\n\n== Founding and First Concerts ==\nFounded in November 2005 by Miguel Campos Neto and Yaniv Segal, the orchestra was originally called The City Orchestra of New York, but later changed its name to The Chelsea Symphony after establishing itself as the resident orchestra of Chelsea, Manhattan.  The orchestra gave its first concert (as The City Orchestra of New York) on May 20, 2006, at the German Church of St. Paul's.  The concert featured conductors Ankush Bahl, Miguel Campos Neto, Avlana Eisenberg, Geoffrey Robson, and Yaniv Segal; soloists Greg Giannascoli (Marimba) and Michael Ludwig (Violin); and composer Aaron Dai.\nThe orchestra gave its first concerts as The Chelsea Symphony on September 9 and 10, 2006, at St. Peter's Church - Chelsea and the German Church of St. Paul's, respectively.

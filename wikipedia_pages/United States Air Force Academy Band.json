    "text": "The United States Air Force Academy Band is a United States military band based out of Peterson Space Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colorado. Despite the fact that it provides musical support to the USAFA Cadet Wing, it is an active duty full time band. The USAFA Drum and Bugle Corps on the other hand is staffed by cadets of the academy. The band, like many other USAF bands, performs in a distinctive ceremonial dress, which includes a choker-style collar, and silver-braided epaulettes. It is one of two premier ensembles in the air force, with the other being the United States Air Force Band. The band was raised in 1955, shortly after the foundation of the academy.\n\nThe band is composed of the following ensembles:\n\nMarching Band\nConcert Band (45 members)\nThe Falconaires\nBlue Steel\nAcademy Winds\nRampart Winds\nStellar Brass\nWild Blue Country\nThe band performs at public/civic as well as community events. It often leads military parades at the academy or performs for Falcon fans at American football games.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of United States Air Force bands\nUnited States Air Force Band\nWest Point Band\nUnited States Naval Academy Band\nUnited States Naval Academy Pipes and Drums\nUnited States Merchant Marine Academy Regimental Band\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nThe marching band at the  2009 USAFA awards parade"

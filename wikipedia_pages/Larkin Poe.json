    "text": "Larkin Poe is an American roots rock  band led by sisters Rebecca Lovell and Megan Lovell. The band originated in north Georgia and is currently based in Nashville, Tennessee. Known for their strong southern harmonies, heavy electric guitar riffs, steel guitar, Larkin Poe often draws comparisons to the style of the Allman Brothers. The Lovell sisters have gained recognition for their energetic performances and musical prowess.\nThe band's history began with the Lovell Sisters, an acoustic music trio formed in 2005 with their older sister, Jessica Lovell. After releasing independent albums and touring for four years, the Lovell Sisters disbanded in 2010.

The band performed at the 2014 and 2016 Glastonbury Festival and were voted \"Best Discovery of Glastonbury 2014\" by the UK's The Observer.\nTheir musical journey continued with the release of albums like Peach in 2017, Venom & Faith in 2018, and Self Made Man in 2020, which achieved notable success on the Billboard Top Blues Albums chart.

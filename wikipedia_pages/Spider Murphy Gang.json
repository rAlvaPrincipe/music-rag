    "text": "The Spider Murphy Gang is a German rock band from Munich best known for their greatest hit \"Skandal im Sperrbezirk\", which is a famous song of the Neue Deutsche Welle. It was founded in 1977 by bank clerk Günther Sigl, together with Gerhard Gmell (\"Barny Murphy\"), Michael Busse and Franz Trojan. Elements of the Bavarian German dialect are used in many songs.\nTheir name is a reference to Elvis Presley's song, \"Jailhouse Rock\", in which a 'Spider Murphy' played the tenor saxophone. \"Spider Murphy\" is also referred to in a song written by Larry Kirwan of the Irish fusion Band Black 47's song, \"Forty Deuce.\"  The song appears referential to both the Spider Murphy Gang and to \"Jailhouse Rock\", for the live version from 2006's \"Bittersweet 16\" includes a saxophone solo which the singer recalls having heard in Sing Sing prison.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nGünther Sigl – Vocals/Bass\nGerhard Gmell – Guitar\nWillie Duncan – Guitar/Bass/Lap Steel/Mandolin/Vocals\nOtto Staniloi – Sax\nPaul Dax – Drums\nLudwig Seuss – Keys\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nRock'n'Roll (1978)\nRock'n'Roll Schuah (1980)\nDolce Vita (1981)\nTutti Frutti (1982)\nSpider Murphy Gang live!

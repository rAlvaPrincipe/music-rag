    "text": "Danger in the Air was a regional bluegrass band based in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. It is best known as the band in which Robin Lynn Macy performed while simultaneously founding the all-female group the Dixie Chicks in 1989.\nThe band was founded by Drew Garrett (bass) and Andy Owens (mandolin).  Both musicians were established bluegrass musicians. The original group also included Robin Macy on guitar and vocals. James McKinney joined the group early in 1986 on banjo. Stephan Dudash (5-string viola) was a late addition. As a five-piece, the band won first place at several regional competitions and placed fourth in the national SPBGMA band contest in Nashville.\nDanger in the Air released two cassettes: a self-titled recording and Airtight.\nIn 1990, the band dissolved, due in part to Macy's commitments to the fledgling band, The Dixie Chicks. James McKinney moved to Nashville where he continued to perform using the band's name. After dropping the name in 2003, he and his wife performed as the James & Angela McKinney Band.  Angela McKinney has since pursued a solo career.\nGarrett eventually moved to Colorado where he worked as a sound engineer and producer.  He currently plays the bass for the bluegrass quartet Blue Canyon Boys.\nOwens remains active in bluegrass circles. He introduced Macy to the Erwin sisters and recorded their three-track demo. His Andy Owens Project released several CDs. He recorded and toured with Druha Trava in 2007.\nDudash continues to record and perform. He released Mango Django in 2004.\nMacy eventually left the Chicks over a dispute in musical direction. She eventually moved to Kansas where she is the owner of the Bartlett Arboretum in Belle Plaine.  She teaches  mathematics at the Wichita Collegiate School in Wichita.\n\n\n== Band line-up ==\nDrew Garrett – bass;\nRobin Lynn Macy – guitar, vocals\nAndy Owens – Mandolin, vocals\nJames McKinney – banjo\nStephan Dudash – viola, vocals\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Danger in the Air (1988) ===\nSelf-released Cassette\nProduced and arranged by Danger in the Air\nRecorded at TMPS Studios, Austin, Texas, by Larry Seyer\nDrew Garrett, Bass; James McKinney, Banjo; Andy Owens, Mandolin; Robin Lynn Macy, Guitar; Stephan Dudash, Fiddle.\nTracks\n1.

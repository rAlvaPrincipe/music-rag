The band's most successful single was 1997's \"Rational\", from the album Junior Relaxer. Their music fuses elements of punk, grunge, funk, jazz and dance. The core of the band is singer/songwriter Kevan Byrne and bassist Kevin Lynn. A variety of other collaborators, including Sam Cino, Al Okada, Gary Dutch, Geoff Walton, Steve Clarkson, Mike Armstrong, Nathan Lawr, Don Pyle and Michelle McAdorey, have contributed to individual albums.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1993 the band, named for a special kind of toy marble, released its self-titled album, which fused progressive rock with dubstep sampling. In 1994 the band was signed to the EMI label, and released the followup album Project Twinkle. The album received a Juno Award nomination for Alternative Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1995.\nFollowing Project Twinkle, the band also performed a number of improvisational shows under the pseudonym Junior Relaxer, which would become the title of their third album in 1997. The album's lead single, \"Rational\", was the band's biggest hit, and garnered the band a MuchMusic Video Award nomination for Best Video at the 1997 MMVAs.\nIn 1999, as Junior Relaxer, the band gave a number of performances at Rancho Relaxo in Toronto.\nPercussionist Robin Easton participated as drummer 14 in the Boredoms 77 Boadrum performance which occurred on July 7, 2007 at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York.

In the fall of 2012, the band re-released Project Twinkle  on Pheromone Recordings and performed the album live in its entirety at the Horseshoe Tavern and  at Van Gogh's Ear in Guelph as part of the Stay Out Of The Mall XI festival.\nOn December 12, 2013 King Cobb Steelie released Goodbye Arcadia, a four-track EP.

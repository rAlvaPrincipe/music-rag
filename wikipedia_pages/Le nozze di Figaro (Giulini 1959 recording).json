    "text": "Le nozze di Figaro is a 1959 EMI studio recording of Mozart's opera of the same name with the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus under Carlo Maria Giulini. The cast includes Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as the Countess, Anna Moffo as Susanna, Eberhard Wächter as the Count, Giuseppe Taddei as Figaro and Fiorenza Cossotto as Cherubino. The recording, made at Kingsway Hall, London, was first released on EMI in 1961 with Walter Legge as producer.\nCritics have praised the richness, beauty, timing, dramatic effect, vocal texture, clarity and detail of the recording and noted the superior cast. The recording was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording in 1962. Since its first release, the recording has remained a popular classic in the gramophone catalog. Due to its popularity, EMI has rereleased the album several times, but the transfer to two CDs that interrupted the longest uninterrupted piece of music Mozart ever wrote, the 20-minute finale of act 2, met some criticism.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the 1950s, Giulini served as the music director of La Scala for several years and made recordings of works of various Baroque and Romantic composers, including Verdi’s La traviata with Renata Tebaldi in 1952 (Milan RAI) and Maria Callas in 1955 (La Scala). Under his baton, several recordings were released with EMI Columbia Records and the Philharmonia Orchestra. By the end of the 1950s, Giulini had established himself as a conductor of grand opera. Giulini’s 1959 recording of Don Giovanni received widespread critical acclaim and remains the classic reference recording for the opera.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Musical ===\nCarlo Maria Giulini – conductor\nPhilharmonia Orchestra – orchestra\nPhilharmonia Chorus – chorus\nRoberto Benaglio – chorus master\nElisabeth Schwarzkopf (soprano) – Countess Almaviva\nAnna Moffo (soprano) – Susanna\nFiorenza Cossotto (mezzo-soprano) – Cherubino\nEberhard Wächter (baritone) – Count Almaviva\nGiuseppe Taddei (baritone) – Figaro\nPiero Cappuccilli (baritone) – Antonio\nIvo Vinco (bass) – Bartolo\nElisabetta Fusco (soprano) – Barberina\nDora Gatta (soprano) – Marcellina\nRenato Ercolani (tenor) – Don Basilio / Don Curzio\nDiana Gillingham, Gillian Spencer – young girl\nHeinrich Schmidt – harpsichord\n\n\n=== Other ===\nWalter Legge – producer, art director\nDouglas Larter – engineer\nWilliam Mann – liner notes\nWilliam R.

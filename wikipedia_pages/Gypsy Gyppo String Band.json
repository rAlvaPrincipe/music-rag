    "text": "The Gypsy Gyppo String Band was an American old-time music band, based in Seattle, Washington.\nActive in the 1970s, it brought a contemporary sensibility to this music, treating it \"as source material rather than holy writ.\" The band played a key role in reviving this music, bringing it out to the dying milieu of Grange halls and the somewhat-staid milieu of organized Modern western square dance to a hip, young urban audience. It laid the foundation of a square dance and contra dance scene in and around Seattle that continues to this day.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nArgo, Warren (May 2002). \"So What Is It About This Contra Dancing Anyway?\" (PDF format; required Adobe Reader).

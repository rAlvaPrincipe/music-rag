The name of the band Dudaim comes from the Hebrew word for the mandrake plant, which is native to the Mediterranean region.\n\n\n== History ==\nDudaim was formed in 1957 when Amdursky and Guriun met in a party in Jerusalem and started singing together. Their first album Erev Shel Shoshanim came out in 1957, and included the hit song in the same name. Another hit song from the same album was Tapuach Hinani (תפוח חינני) which was later recorded by the Weavers.  In 1959, they toured Europe and the USA. They recorded several albums in France and the US, where they changed their name to Ben and Adam for promotional purposes.\nIn 1965-6, they collaborated with Arik Einstein as the Yarkon Bridge Trio. In August The trio was invited to perform in an Israel-themed show at the Paris Olympia, a performance which led to a two-album deal with French producer Eddie Barclay In September 1965 the trio released its second album, HaTochnit HaChadasha (The New Program; Hebrew: התכנית החדשה‎), following which the trio embarked on a tour in Europe. In January 1966 the trio voted best entertainment group for the Kinor David award.\nIn the '70s the Dudaim started working as a duo again, performing in the Israeli Song Festival twice, and taking first prize in 1972, together with Josie Katz, performing the song \"Tov li Lashir\" (טוב לי לשיר).

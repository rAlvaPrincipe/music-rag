    "text": "The San Bernardino Symphony orchestra is an American symphony orchestra, based in San Bernardino, California. Founded in 1929 by newspaper magnate and conductor, James K. Guthrie, the San Bernardino Symphony is one of the oldest professional orchestras in the state of California. They put on a concert subscription season and many additional performances throughout the region.\nIn addition to their subscription concerts series, the Symphony provides two free concerts for the schools serving over 3,000 students annually, introductory workshops (live and virtual) on orchestral instruments for every local third grade class (approximately 5,000 students annually) in the San Bernardino City USD, and master classes/music workshops for students of all ages. They also offer a certificated Symphony Teens program providing job skills training to local high school students. \nThe orchestra performs the majority of their season at the historic California Theatre of the Performing Arts. The orchestra's current music director is Anthony R. Parnther, since 2019.\nAfter a two-year long international search, the San Bernardino Symphony appointed Anthony R.

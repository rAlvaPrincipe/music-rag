    "text": "Mass of the Fermenting Dregs (マス オブ ザ ファーメンティング ドレッグス, Masu obu za Fāmentingu Doreggusu) (capitalized in its stylization) is a post-hardcore/shoegaze trio formed in Kobe, Japan, in 2002. In Japanese, they are also popularly known by a shortened form of their name, Masu Dore (マスドレ). They are known for a tightly arranged, guitar-driven style, melodic pop vocals and a high-energy stage presence at their live events.\nStarting with the release of their self-titled EP in January 2008, they signed to the Japanese indie rock record label AVOCADO Records. They have released four albums since their second EP. After their first album, they have released independently or gone through FLAKE SOUNDS.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nMass of the Fermenting Dregs was formed in 2002 in Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture, with the original all-female lineup of Natsuko Miyamoto, Chiemi Ishimoto and Reiko Gotoh. The name of the band was conceived by simply lining up words the members liked. Following Reiko's departure from the band in October 2007, the band toured with the official lineup of Natsuko and Chiemi, with various musicians serving as a \"support drummer\". Their breakthrough came at the 2007 \"Road to Tarbox Audition\" competition held by EMI Japan, which put the band in contact with noted American record producer Dave Fridmann (The Flaming Lips, OK Go) of Tarbox Road Studios. With Fridmann producing, they recorded two tracks, I F A Surfer and Bears (ベアーズ), which appeared on their 2008 self-titled E.P. In 2010, support drummer Isao Yoshino became an official member of the band, prior to the release of their major label debut album.\n\n\n=== Departure of Chiemi Ishimoto ===\nIn October 2010, it was announced that the band's guitarist of six years, Chiemi Ishimoto, would be leaving the group after completing the band's national tour on 11 December 2010. Her leaving was due to a medical panic disorder. Ishimoto's last performance was held at the Shibuya Club Quattro. Guitarist and lead vocalist Eriko Hashimoto of the band Chatmonchy attended the performance, sharing the enthralling experience of the final performance of \"End Roll\" on her official blog on her band's official website.\n\n\n=== Departure of Isao Yoshino ===\nIn December 2011, Isao Yoshino announced that he would be leaving the group for undisclosed reasons. This left Miyamoto as the sole founding and active member of the band.\n\n\n=== Dissolution ===\nThough Natsuko Miyamoto, with the help of supporting members, continued to perform as Mass of the Fermenting Dregs through the spring of 2012, on September the 1st of the same year, she officially announced that Mass of the Fermenting Dregs would cease to exist as of that day. As a parting present, Miyamoto shared what was, at that moment, the last of the works recorded with Yoshino. A song titled \"たんたんたん\" (tantantan) was made available for download through a direct link placed within the page containing the departing letter to the fans on the official M.o.F.D. website.\n\n\n=== Reformation (2015–present) ===\nIn December the M.o.F.D website started to update, deleting the departing letter on the website. Natsuko Miyamoto sent hints on Twitter about M.o.F.D, and the band was later confirmed to play on the New Year's Q2 Concert, thus confirming the reunion of the band. In May 2016, the band played in three Canadian cities on the \"Next Music From Tokyo\" concert tour.\nOn 1 August 2022, the M.o.F.D. website was updated, announcing a new album titled \"Awakening:Sleeping.\" Similar announcements were made on the same day on the band's Instagram account as well as Natsuko Miyamoto's account with a digital release marked for 17 August 2022, as well as a CD release on 7 October. The band also announced that they would be planning to do a European Tour the following year. On 9 September, the band had opened up for HARU NEMURI at the WWW X Shibuya before heading out on their second U.S. Tour.\n\n\n== Style and influences ==\nThe band's sound is often compared to that of other influential Japanese post-hardcore acts, notably NUMBER GIRL (ナンバー・ガール). They are often associated with the alternative/progressive rock act 9mm Parabellum Bullet(キューミリ・パラベラム・バレット), with whom they toured in early 2009.\nThe English version of the band's website also claims western alternative rock bands Sugar, The Wedding Present, and The Smashing Pumpkins as influences on their songwriting.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\nKirametal (demo) – released 15 September 2006, independent\n\nMASS OF THE FERMENTING DREGS  – released 16 January 2008, AVOCADO Records\n\nWorld is Yours  (ワールド イズ ユアーズ　Waarudo Izu Yuaazu) – released 21 January 2009, AVOCADO Records\n\nHikizuru Beat / Made.

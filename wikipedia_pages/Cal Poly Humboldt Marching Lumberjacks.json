    "text": "The Marching Lumberjacks are the official student run marching band of California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (formerly Humboldt State University). Established in 1968, the band performs in the scatter band style often associated with Ivy League schools, using humorous routines and scripts during its halftime field shows in Redwood Bowl.\n\n\n== Performances ==\nThe band plays at numerous campus and community events, marches in parades across California, Oregon and Washington, aids in student recruiting, and performs at home football and basketball games. Its traditional uniform consists of a yellow aluminum logger's hardhat, suspenders, a yellow t-shirt with the band's \"marching Lucky Logger\" logo on the front and \"Kiss our Axe\" logo on the back, green work pants, and boots. Major away gigs are broken up into the spring and fall semesters. Spring events include Cloverdale Citrus Parade in Cloverdale, St. Patrick's Day Parade in San Francisco, and Battle of the Marching Bands at UC Davis, and fall events include Paul Bunyan Days parade in Fort Bragg and Italian Heritage Parade in San Francisco.\n\n\n=== The Band's Introduction ===\nLadies and gentlemen\nBoys and Girls\nRepublicans and Democrats\nTea Partiers and Greens...\nThe Associated Students of Humboldt State\nAre unable to prevent your world famous\nHumboldt State University Marching Lumberjacks!\n\n\n== Appearances in Media ==\nThe group was depicted marching into the Pacific Ocean in a photograph in the July 1993 National Geographic magazine.

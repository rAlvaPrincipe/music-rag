    "text": "Held By Trees are an English instrumental post rock project, founded by multi-instrumentalist David Joseph. The groups main influence is Talk Talk and Mark Hollis, specifically the albums The Colour Of Spring (1986), Spirit Of Eden (1988), Laughing Stock (1991), as well as Mark Hollis (1998). \nThe project was founded by Joseph during the first COVID-19 lockdown, he had previously collaborated with guitarist Tim Renwick who introduced him to Talk Talk audio engineer Phill Brown, who then got him in contact with percussionist Martin Ditcham, another Talk Talk associate. Through studio owner Steve Smith, he was also put in contact with guitarist Robbie McIntosh, an associate of Talk Talk, Paul McCartney and the Pretenders. The two then reached out to pianist Lawrence Pendrous, woodwind player Andy Panayi (both of whom played on Mark Hollis), and to late era Talk Talk bassist Simon Edwards. They all agreed to join the project.\nThe group released their first EP, Solace, in April 2022. It featured Joseph, McIntosh, Ditcham, Pendrous, Panayi, Edwards, Renwick, David Knopfler, Eric Bibb and Gary Alesbrook among others.\nWhen the group started touring, they consisted of Joseph, McIntosh, Pendrous and Panayi, as well as bassist James Grant and drummer Paul Beavis. The group has since recorded two live albums, Solace ~ Live at Real World Studios, featuring the usual touring group. \nThe group have also released a second EP, Eventide in September 2023, which features songs not recorded for Solace and was recorded at Peter Gabriel’s Real World Studios. and features guests Grant Howard (Hammond organ, Wurlitzer piano, synths) and Matt Gainsford (additional guitar pad on \"Grow Dark\").\nIn 2024, the group teamed up with vocalist Martin Smith and guitarist Stuart Gerrard, both formerly of Delirious?, and recorded a new self titled EP, also featuring Grant Howard (Hammond organ, synth), Daniel Newberry (saxophone), Ryan Rich (synth bass), Anita Tatlow (vocals).

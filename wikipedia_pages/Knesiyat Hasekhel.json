    "text": "Knesiyat Hasekhel (from Hebrew: \"The Mind Church\") is an Israeli rock band from Sderot.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name of the band, established in the early 1990s, is a translation into Hebrew of Church of Reason, from Robert Pirsig's book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.\nThe music is a blend of new wave music and post-punk influences (particularly Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds) and Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ethnic rock. In 1993, Knesiyat Hasekhel produced its first studio album, \"Whispered Words\" (nanadisk). In 1994, Knesiyat Hasekhel released their second studio album \"Here are Songs\".\nThe third full length and self-titled album \"Knesiyat Hasekhel\" was released in 1999.  The band was named \"best rock group of 1999\" by Israel's national radio station, and invited to play at major rock festivals around the country.\nIn 2001, Mashina's Shlomi Bracha helped produce the band's third album \"Rutz Yeled\" (Run, Kid!), a studio album that was recorded live. Following the release of the album, the band toured with Ehud Banai.\n\nTheir fourth album \"Yadaiim Lemalah\" (Hands Up) was released in 2004, and was produced for the first time by the band themselves.\nIn 2007 the band teamed up with a new label to produce \"Autobiography,\" re-recording their hits accompanied by a 40-piece orchestra composed of ethnic and traditional classical instruments. A live show was produced for the Israel Festival.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nWhispered Words (Nanadisk) – 1993\nHere are Songs (Hed Artzi) – 1994\nChurch of Reason (Levantini) – 1999\nRun Child (NMC Records) – 2001\nHands Up (NMC Records) – 2004\nAutobiography (Barbi Records) – 2007\nRows of People -  2010\nHome Is So Far - 2013\nIt Is Not Me - 2017\n\n\n== See also ==\nIsraeli music\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYouTube page"

The band was formed in Pohjois-Helsingin Bändikoulu (Northern Helsinki Band School) and signed to Universal Music in 1999, when the youngest members were 13. Their debut album, Friends, included songs written by Maki Kolehmainen (of Aikakone) and was a huge hit in Finland, with unusually strong sales in the rest of Europe, especially Scandinavia. The band's music was a blend of rock and pop. Each of the girls played their own instruments with the exception of Petra who was the lead singer.\nThe band gained great domestic popularity. Their first two albums each sold about 100,000 copies.\nThe band was also marketed in the United States where it was called Tik N' Tak.

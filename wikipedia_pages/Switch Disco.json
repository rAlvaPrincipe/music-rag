They completed a summer season together before forming a duo together the following year. They played mash-up sets for several years; one of their mash-ups, of Nelly Furtado's \"Say It Right\" and Bicep's \"Glue\", caught the attention of Relentless Records, who signed them. In 2021, the pair released \"Everything\", which samples Donna Lewis' \"I Love You Always Forever\"; the pair opted to sample the record after playing the song at the end of one of their DJ sets, and deciding to do something with it. The song was used in the opening scene of the first episode of the seventh series of Love Island, which caused its Spotify streams to increase by 185 percent.\nIn 2023, having previously released several mashups using \"Children\" by Robert Miles, the pair released \"React\", a collaboration with Ella Henderson, which heavily sampled the song. The song charted at No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The song was in the charts at the same time as \"Closer\" by Bou featuring Slay, which also sampled \"Children\", and became popular at a time when sampling 1990s hits had become the norm. They later released a music video for the song, and performed the track on the ninth series of Love Island's Reunion show with Non√¥. In February 2024, they released \"Sleep Tonight\" with Sam Feldt and R3hab, which sampled Amy Macdonald's \"This Is the Life\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "The Sunny Cowgirls is an Australian country music group formed in 2005. They have released a total of seven studio albums since 2005. Their debut album, Little Bit Rusty, was released in 2005. Their latest album, Here We Go, was released in September 2016.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe Sunny Cowgirls, Sophie and Celeste Clabburn, grew up on a farm in Hamilton, Victoria. The Clabburn sisters were raised on \"Sunninghill\", the family farm at Dunkeld near Hamilton, Victoria, before the whole family moved to Perth, Western Australia when they were primary school kids. Their farm was in their father's family a long while, and that's where they came up with the name \"Sunny\". After four years of working around the country and doing the occasional gig, they raised enough cash to approach well-known Perth record producer Mark Donohoe to showcase their writing and music.\nThe Cowgirls lives and careers changed in early 2005 when they secured places as aspiring artists in the CMAA College of Country Music, held before the Tamworth Country Music Festival each year. They then signed with Compass Bros Records and their first album, Little Bit Rusty, reached No. 4 on the ARIA country charts.\nThe Sunny Cowgirls have also collaborated with Adam Brand on \"Someday\".\nOn 1 September 2012 The Sunny Cowgirls performed at the 25th Trundle Bush Tucker Day.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== AIR Awards ===\nThe Australian Independent Record Awards (commonly known informally as AIR Awards) is an annual awards night to recognise, promote and celebrate the success of Australia's Independent Music sector.\n\n\n=== Country Music Awards of Australia ===\nThe Country Music Awards of Australia (CMAA) (also known as the Golden Guitar Awards) is an annual awards night held in January during the Tamworth Country Music Festival, celebrating recording excellence in the Australian country music industry.

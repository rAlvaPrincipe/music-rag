    "text": "Blasted Mechanism is a Portuguese electro-rock band known for its highly theatrical live shows involving elaborated alien-themed costumes as a backdrop to their music.\nThe band was founded in 1995 by Karkov and Valdjiu. New members joined later to form the current line up. As they like to put it \"they weren't created but invented\", blasting into the Portuguese music scene with a very different sound and visuals. \nThey quickly became known for their extravagant audiovisual performances involving alien and tribal looking musicians and an irreverent, upbeat attitude. Over the years, they developed a unique musical style that mixes alternative rock, electronic music, reggae, dub and folk.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nBlasted Mechanism Demo (1994)\n(unknown)\nBlasted Mechanism EP (1996)\n\nSwinging with the Monkeys\nCalamidad\nThe Atom Bride theme\nBalayhashi (1998)\n\nSwinging with the Monkeys\nCalamidad\nThe Atom Bride theme\nPolaroid\nGators from Congo\nSingleMix 00 \n\nSwinging with the Monkeys (00 Mix) by Ragmanan Saturnia\nSpasm (pink moon mix) by saturnia\nDanka Danka mix by toolateman\nPlasma (1999)\n\nOh Landou\nThe Art of Fitting\nZapping\nMahdathai\nConnection\nSpasm\n18 Strings\nKarkow\nBlue Mood\nNazka\nSingleMix 01 \n\nKarkov (nadabrovichka mix) radio edit dj dimitrivzki\nThe atom bride theme (remix) live\nToolateman hymn radio edit by toolateman\nMix 00 (2000)\n\nMahdathai (urban mix) by ragmanam\nNazka (jap mix) by ragmanam ary\nSpasm (pink moon mix) by saturnia\nBlue Mood (lungs ahead) by ragmanam ary\nKarkov (nadabrovitchka mix) by dj dimitrivzki\nSwinging With The Monkeys (00 mix) by ragmanam saturnia\nOh Landou (mesthai mix) by ragmanam ary\nCalamidub by toolateman\nThe Atom Bride Theme (remix) by ragmanam saturnia\nZapping (alex fx full mix) by alex fx for underdub\nNamaste Promotional Single (2003)\n\nAre You Ready\nWalking On A Better Day\nTaman Taman (feat.

    "text": "Black Marble is an American music project formed in 2011 in Brooklyn, New York. It is led by electronic musician Chris Stewart and formerly featured Ty Kube of Team Robespierre.\n\n\n== History ==\nBlack Marble began in March 2011, officially releasing their debut EP on Hardly Art titled Weight Against the Door in 2012. Also in 2012, Black Marble released its first full-length album on Hardly Art titled A Different Arrangement. These works were described as \"throwbacks to the cold-wave genre\" by Leo Neufeld of the Miami New Times.\nIn 2016, Black Marble released its second full-length album, titled It's Immaterial. It was released on Ghostly International The album marked Ty Kube's departure from the project and Chris Stewart's move from the East to West Coast. Kristin Porter of SLUG said Stewart \"keeps the band's Brooklyn, New York–synth roots alive, resulting in a collection of songs with amplified vocals, pastel-colored synths and a hint of modern-day deference, which is evocatively scored by Stewart's personal, nostalgic touch coupled with every happy-sad, Ian Curtis–garage dance party you've never been to.\"\nOn July 25, 2019, the band announced that its third studio album, Bigger Than Life, would be released on October 25 through Sacred Bones Records. The record's first single, \"One Eye Open\", was released along with the announcement.\nIn October 2019, Black Marble released the music video to their latest album song Private Show.\nOn October 22, 2021 Black Marble released their fourth studio album, Fast Idol. \n\n\n== Members ==\nChris Stewart - vocals, bass, guitar, synthesizer (2011–present)\nFormer members\n\nTy Kube - keyboards, synthesizer (2011–2016)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nA Different Arrangement (2012, Hardly Art)\nIt's Immaterial (2016, Ghostly International)\nBigger Than Life (2019, Sacred Bones Records)\nFast Idol (2021, Sacred Bones Records)\nEPs\n\nWeight Against the Door (2012, Hardly Art)\nI Must Be Living Twice (2020, Sacred Bones Records)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

Kansas Stone is a high energy country band that fuels off of many different styles. Hailing from Ontario, Canada they deliver a sound that ranges from old and new country, blues, rock, and more. Kansas Stone has become known for their catchy melodies and well crafted original songs.\n\n\n== History ==\nGrowing up, Brian Harwood and Matt Davey were heavily influenced by country artists Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and classic rock artists Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, and Guns N' Roses, among others. The pair started Kansas Stone as a side project in 2013.\nThe band name does not refer directly to the American state, according to Vain, who is credited with having come up with the name. Rather, it refers to the supposed original meaning of the Kansa tribe's name in their native language, which has been roughly translated as \"people of the south wind,\" or as Vain interprets it, \"warm, southern wind.\" The way the band describes their name, it \"epitomizes a warm summer good feeling.\" As for the \"stone\" portion of the name, the band has also stated that \"we're like a family; we're like a stone, solid as a rock.\"\nBoth Harwood and Davey contribute to the band's songwriting effort. During an interview at the 2018 Country Music Association of Ontario Awards, Harwood and Davey stated that they co-wrote Blaze of Nothing with input from friend Patricia Conroy while they were visiting Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\n== Music ==\nKansas Stone has released several singles, and one EP, Country 101, which was released in 2016.

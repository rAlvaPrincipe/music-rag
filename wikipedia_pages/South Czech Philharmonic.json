    "text": "The South Czech Philharmonic (formerly known as South Bohemian Chamber Philharmonic or Chamber Philharmonic Orchestra of South Bohemia), based in České Budějovice, was founded in 1981; its original name was The South Bohemian State Orchestra.  At present, it consists of 37 artists and remains the only professional philharmonic orchestra in the region of South Bohemia.\nOrigins of the orchestra are associated with a Czech conductor Jaroslav Vodňanský; subsequently, the position of Chief Conductor was held by Ondřej Kukal, Břetislav Novotný, Jaroslav Křeček and Stanislav Vavřínek.  The current Chief Conductor, Jan Talich, has been leading the orchestra since 2008.\nBesides interpreting the music of classical composers and pieces appropriate for chambre orchestras and smaller concert halls, the Philharmonic is dedicating increasing attention to the contemporary trend of interlinking genres and discovering new perspectives of both interpretation and  presentation of music.\n\n\n== References ==\nSouth Czech Philharmonic page on The Association of Symphony Orchestras and Choirs of the Czech Republic website\nReference to the South Czech Philharmonic on the Lonely Planet site\n\n\n== External links ==\nSouth Czech Philharmonic official website\nOpen-air concert of South Czech Philharmonic in Lipno [1]\nThe South Bohemian Chamber Philharmonic Discography\nList of South Czech Philharmonic orchestra concerts during the Year of Czech Music 2014"

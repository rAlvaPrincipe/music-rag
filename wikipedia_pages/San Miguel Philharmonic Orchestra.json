    "text": "The San Miguel Philharmonic Orchestra (SMPO) was one of the two major performing arts groups (along with the San Miguel Master Chorale) under the San Miguel Foundation for the Performing Arts. As a young ensemble, its wide selection of works encompassing musical genres attests to its versatility and dynamism. Together with the SMMC, the SMPO aspired to produce and perform new orchestral works that will ensure the growth and development of Filipino music.\nThe SMPO, together with the San Miguel Master Chorale, was disbanded in late January 2007 by the San Miguel Corporation.\n\n\n== Disbandment ==\nIn a swift and silent move, the big bosses of the San Miguel Corporation (SMC) have already disbanded the SMPO and the SMMC. Late January 2007, instrumentalists of the SMPO and SMMC were summoned one by one by the big bosses who informed them of the non-renewal of their contracts. Many of the performers did not get any separation pay. Insider reports say that the SMC was \"more inclined\" on supporting its four professional basketball teams. No word yet on what happened to Ryan Cayabyab, the SMFPA's Executive and artistic director.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Great Filipino Love Songs ===\nThe SMPO has been featured in all the existing SMFPA albums to date, but its first solo album, Great Filipino Love Songs (GFLS), was a bestseller in major record bars and a certified gold record, thereby breaking records of sorts when it was released in 2004.\n\nGFLS was the first locally produced album to feature full-blown orchestral arrangements of well-known Filipino classics. It was produced and recorded in a span of 3 years.\nIt emerged as No. 2 album in sales charts upon its release in 2004, and after a week became No. 1, surpassing the sales of contemporary mainstream artists like Usher, Josh Groban, Maroon 5, Beyonc√©, and Evanescence.\nAccording to sales reports, the album has been bought by bulk by many customers as presents and give-aways among families and corporations for all occasions.\nThe album earned phenomenal success despite minimal advertising.\nTrack List:\n\nBato sa Buhangin\nMaalaala Mo Kaya\nIkaw\nMinamahal Kita\nDahil Sa Iyo\nHindi Kita Malimot\nAng Tangi Kong Pag-ibig\nBuhat\nGaano Ko Ikaw Kamahal\nIkaw ang Mahal Ko\nKatakataka\nMinamahal, Sinasamba\nSaan Ka Man Naroroon\nLahat ng Araw\n\n\n=== Great Original Pilipino Music ===\nCreated  by Ryan Cayabyab.

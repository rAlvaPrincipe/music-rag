    "text": "Bourbonese Qualk were an experimental music group which existed from 1980 to 2003. The group were participants in the early 80s industrial & experimental music tape scene. Writing for CMJ, Martin Aston characterized Bourbonese Qualk as \"post-punk, avant funk\" along the lines of 23 Skidoo, A Certain Ratio, 400 Blows and early Cabaret Voltaire.\nThey're also known for their political activism, formed in the crucible of 1980s Britain amid such influences as the UK miners' strike, the Falklands War, Thatcherism, monetarism, local government corruption, squatting, anti-capitalism, anti-fascism, and anarchism. Their work was often ambiguous and directly critical of power-politics of any color, often irritating members of the traditional organized left. In 1984 Bourbonese Qualk occupied a large empty building - The Ambulance Station - on the Old Kent Road in South London, which they turned into a base for their activities, a cooperative space for artists, musicians, and writers, and a center for radical political activism -- specifically as a coordinating center for the Stop the City anti-capitalist protests of 1984.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nLaughing Afternoon LP (Recloose Organization 1983)\nHope LP (Recloose Organization 1984)\nThe Spike LP (Dossier 1985)\nPreparing For Power LP (Recloose Organization 1986)\nBourbonese Qualk LP (New International Recordings 1987)\nMy Government is My Soul LP/CD (Fünfundvierzig 1990)\nBo'Qu LP (New International Recordings 1990)\nKneejerk Reaction EP (Praxis 1992)\nQual EP (Praxis 1992)\nUnPop CD (Total F.I. 1993)\nFeeding the Hungry Ghost CD (Fünfundvierzig 1994)\nAutonomia CD (Praxis 1994)\nOn Uncertainty (2000)\nMoscow (2002)\nLies (2015)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial archive of Bourbonese Qualk\nCrab's blog"

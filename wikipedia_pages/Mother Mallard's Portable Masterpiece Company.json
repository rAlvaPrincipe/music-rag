    "text": "Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company, formed in 1969 by David Borden, was an early synthesizer ensemble, predating groups like Tonto's Expanding Head Band and Tangerine Dream.  Borden was in contact with Robert Moog and was one of the first musicians to use his Minimoog. After recruiting Steve Drews and Linda Fisher to operate additional synthesizers, the group began playing concerts of minimalist music by Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass. They began recording their first, self-titled album in 1970, but it would not be released until 1973 by Earthquack Records. Their second album, Like a Duck to Water, was released in 1976. Borden and Mother Mallard continue performing Borden's recent and older music.\nDavid Borden and Mother Mallard continued performing and releasing albums in the following years, most notably on the Cuneiform record label. Borden adopted new digital synthesizer technology over time, and also incorporated various acoustic woodwind instruments and voices. Borden's most ambitious work, The Continuing Story of Counterpoint Parts 1-12, composed between 1976 and 1987, was recorded and released on three Cuneiform CDs between 1988 and 1991. The label also reissued Mother Mallard's first two 1970s recordings on CD.\n\n\n== Lineup ==\nDavid Borden\nBlaise Bryski\nDavid Yearsley\nJosh Oxford\nConrad Alexander\nGabriel Borden\nLynn Pursen\nSource: \n\n\n== Former members ==\nSteve Drews\nJudy Borsher\nLinda Fisher\nLes Thimming\n\n\n== Discography (Mother Mallard and David Borden) ==\n1973 Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Co.

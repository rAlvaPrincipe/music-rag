    "text": "The Palo Alto Chamber Orchestra or PACO is a youth chamber orchestra based in Palo Alto, California. The emphasis on chamber music sets it apart from other youth orchestras. The orchestra is made up of 5 ensembles (namely SuperStrings, Preparatory, Debut, Sinfonia, and Senior) of about 25 members each who rehearse weekly and perform throughout the year.[1] PACO also conducts international tours with the Senior PACO ensemble occasionally.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Palo Alto Chamber Orchestra was founded in 1966 by William Whitson, who served as the orchestra's music director for 36 years. In 2002, violist Benjamin Simon was appointed the role of music director.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPalo Alto Chamber Orchestra"

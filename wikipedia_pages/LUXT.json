    "text": "LUXT was an American industrial metal band formed in Sacramento, California by multi-instrumentalists Anna Christine and Erie Loch, with Loch composing the lyrics.\n\n\n== History ==\nLUXT was formed out of Sacramento, California in 1995 by multi-instrumentalists Anna Christine and Erie Loch. Their 1996 debut album was titled Jezebel Thirteen Three and released by the band's label Chalkhead Records. In 1997 the band was signed to 21st Circuitry and released their second album Disrepair in March. LUXT's third album Razing Eden followed a year later and was released by 21st Circuitry. It was viewed as a marked improvement over their previous work because of its higher production value and greater focus on hooks and melodies. In 2000 the band self-released another album for Chalkhead Records titled Chromasex Monkeydrive.\nThe band's fifth album American Beast was released in 2003 by Blackliner Records. In February of that year the album peaked on three CMJ's charts: \"Loud Rock: College\" at number nineteen, \"Loud Rock: Crucial Spins\" at number thirty-two and \"CMJ Retail 100\" at number ninety-one. After ten years together LUXT disbanded on April 15, 2005.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nJezebel Thirteen Three (1996, Chalkhead)\nDisrepair (1997, 21st Circuitry)\nRazing Eden (1998, 21st Circuitry)\nChromasex Monkeydrive (2000, Chalkhead)\nAmerican Beast (2003, Blackliner)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLUXT on Facebook\nLUXT discography at Discogs \nLUXT discography at MusicBrainz"

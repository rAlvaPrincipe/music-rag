    "text": "The Gibson Bros. was an American garage rock band formed in Columbus, Ohio, in 1984 by singer, songwriter, and musicologist Jeffrey Evans. Formed in 1984 as a quartet, the band serves as the origin of various garage rock bands including '68 Comeback, the Workdogs, and the Bassholes.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Gibson Bros. were formed in 1984 as a quartet with the lineup consisting of Don Howland, vocalist/guitarist; Jeffrey Evans, vocalist/guitarist; Dan Dow, guitarist; Ellen Hoover, drummer. The four remained consistent in the band's first three studio albums: Build a Raft, Big Pine Boogie, and Dedicated Fool. Their debut album, Build a Raft, was only issued on cassette tape.\nIn the Gibson Bros.' fourth album, Punk Rock Truck Driving Song of a Gun, Howland and Evans were billed with the Workdogs, including bassist Rob Kennedy and drummer Scott Garvis. Their following album, The Man Who Loved Cough Dancing, they alternated between home recordings and live shots, with Joe Spencer and Christina Martinez being involved in the production. With their sixth and final album recorded at Sun Studio, Memphis Sol Today!, Spencer returned to be involved in the production of the album, and the Gibson Bros. broke up after the release of the album. By the time of the breakup, they were involved with their respective bands, with Evans in '68 Comeback and Howland in the Bassholes.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nGibson Bros., \"Emulsified\" b/w \"Broke Down Engine\" (Siltbreeze Records) SB 03.

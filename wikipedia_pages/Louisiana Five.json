    "text": "The Louisiana Five was an early Dixieland jazz band that was active from 1917 to 1920. It was among the earliest jazz groups to record extensively. The Louisiana Five was led by drummer Anton Lada.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Louisiana Five was formed in New York City. Lada recruited the other four members, the pianist Joe Cawley, trombonist Charlie Panelli (often spelled \"Panely\" in contemporary material) and banjo player Karl Berger. The clarinetist Alcide \"Yellow\" Nunez was with the Louisiana Five (1918â€“19).\nThe band recorded extensively for various companies including Emerson Records, whose catalogue was leased to Medallion Records, Columbia Records and Edison Records, and went on to produce such hits as \"Clarinet Squawk\" and \"Slow and Easy\". On one recording session they were joined by the multi-instrumentalist Bernard \"Doc\" Beherendson on cornet.\nThe band was popular in the New York City area in 1919 and made tours of Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nAfter Nunez left the band, the group made one more pair of recordings in 1920 with a violin replacing the clarinet.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAfter All (1919)\nA Good Man Is Hard to Find (1918)\nAlcoholic Blues (1919)\nB-Hap-E (1919)\nBig Fat Ma (1919)\nBlues My Naughty Sweetie Gives to Me (1919)\nChurch Street Sobbin Blues (1919)\nClarinet Squawk (1919)\nDixie Blues (1919)\nDown Where the Rajahs Dwell (1919)\nFoot Warmer (1919)\nGolden Rod (1919)\nHeart Sickness Blues (1918)\nHello, Hello (1919)\nHigh Brown Babies' Ball (1919)\nI Ain't 'En Got 'Er No Time to Have the Blues (1919)\nI'll Get Him Yet (1920)\nJust Another Good Man Gone Wrong (1919)\nLaughing Blues (1918)\nLand of Creole Girls (1920)\nLead Me to It (1919)\nOh Joe, Get Your Fiddle and Your Bow (1920)\nOrange Blossom Rag (1919)\nRainy Day Blues (1919)\nRingtail Blues (1919)\nSlow and Easy (1919)\nSummer Days (1919)\nSunshine Girl (1920)\nThat Shanghai Melody (1919)\nTown Topic Rag (1919)\nThunderbolt (1919)\nVirginia Blues (1919)\nWeary Blues (1919)\nWeeping Willow Blues (1920)\nYama Yama Blues (1919)\nYelping Hound Blues (1919)\nYou Can't Get Lovin' Where There Ain't Any Love (1919)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\"Louisiana Five\" with audio samples Red Hot Jazz Archive\n\n\n== External links ==\nWorks by Louisiana Five at Project Gutenberg \nWorks by or about Louisiana Five at the Internet Archive"

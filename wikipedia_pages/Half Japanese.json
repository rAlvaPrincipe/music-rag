    "text": "Half Japanese is an American art punk band formed by brothers Jad and David Fair in 1974, after their family's relocation to Uniontown, Maryland. \nHalf Japanese' original instrumentation included a small drum set, which they took turns playing; vocals; and an out-of-tune, distorted guitar. Both Fair brothers sang, although over time Jad held the frontman role. As of the band's last several releases since the 1990s, according to the album and CD credits, Half Japanese composes and plays the entirety of the music while Fair, eschewing his role as guitarist from earlier albums, plays almost no guitar but is responsible for the vocals and lyrics, which typically divide into either \"love songs or monster songs.\"\n\n\n== Band history ==\nTheir lyrics often deal with monsters and the supernatural (especially as influenced by \"creature feature\" and sci-fi movies), in addition to more conventional themes, such as young love.\nThe band released their first single, \"Calling All Girls\", in August 1977, followed by a triple album, 1/2 Gentlemen/Not Beasts. \nThe band played and recorded as a duo until the early 1980s, when they began incorporating additional members into the group: Mark Jickling (guitar and vocals) and brothers Ricky and John Dreyfuss (drums and saxophone). Since that time, dozens of musicians have come and gone under the Half Japanese banner, including Howard Wuelfing, Don Fleming and Jay Spiegel both from the band Velvet Monkeys, and Shockabilly bass player and Shimmy Disc impresario Mark Kramer among others. Jad is the only member who has been with Half Japanese from the beginning.\nThe next line-up of Half Japanese came together in the late 1980s, proving to be a long-lasting and stable unit recording several albums and touring frequently throughout the United States, Europe, and Japan. This incarnation featured guitarist/multi-instrumentalist John Sluggett (also a longtime member of Moe Tucker's band), multi-instrumentalist Jason Willett, Mick Hobbs, and drummer Gilles Reider. Since then, the group has worked with Moe Tucker from The Velvet Underground, who produced and performed on Fire In the Sky (1992), as well as The Band That Would Be King, and with Fred Frith, and John Zorn, among others.\nKurt Cobain, who had them open some dates of Nirvana's 1993 In Utero tour, was wearing a Half Japanese T-shirt when he died.\nThe band's history and influence are chronicled in the 1993 documentary Half Japanese: The Band That Would Be King by Jeff Feuerzeig. The band was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he curated in March 2012 in Minehead. \nIn 1997, the band released Heaven Sent.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nHalf Gentlemen/Not Beasts (Armageddon, 1980)\nLoud (Armageddon, 1981)\nOur Solar System (Iridescence, 1984)\nSing No Evil (Iridescence, 1985)\nMusic To Strip By (50 Skidillion Watts, 1987)\nCharmed Life (50 Skidillion Watts, 1988)\nThe Band That Would Be King (50 Skidillion Watts, 1989)\nWe Are They Who Ache with Amorous Love (TEC Tones, 1990)\nFire In The Sky (Paperhouse, 1992)\nHot (Safe House, 1995)\nBone Head (Alternative Tentacles, 1997)\nHeaven Sent (Emperor Jones, 1997)\nHello (Alternative Tentacles, 2001)\nOverjoyed (Joyful Noise, 2014)\nPerfect (Joyful Noise, 2016)\nHear the Lions Roar (Fire Records, 2017)\nWhy Not?

    "text": "Mass Hysteria is a French heavy metal band formed in 1993. They have released eleven studio albums and four live albums in their 30-year career. Their breakthrough came in 1999 with their second album Contraddiction.\n\n\n== The band ==\nMass Hysteria is known for their eclecticism, combining industrial metal, alternative metal, rock and rap (2001–2005).\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe band sings primarily in French which has made them an exception throughout the metal sphere.\n\n\n== History ==\nCreated in 1993, the band recorded their first album, Le Bien-être et la Paix (Well-being and Peace), four years later. After this album, Mass Hysteria's breakthrough album came in 1999 with the release of Contraddiction which sold  over 50,000 copies. The album itself is still widely regarded as the band's iconic 'Black album'. It was produced and mixed by Colin Richardson.\nIn 2001 the band returned after intensive touring with a different approach with the release of 'De Cercle en Cercle'. This album received mixed feelings with the arrival of new guitarist Olivier Coursier. The album's new pop/rap experiment approach left the band isolated from the metal scene. Michel Houellebecq, met in Québec, was supposed to write one of the songs but the agreement was never finalized.\nIn 2005 the band released 'Mass Hysteria' confirming the band's new, softer pop/metal approach. Finally, in 2007 with the departure of Olivier and arrival of Nicolas Savoury the band returned with 'Une somme de détails' (an addition of details). The album pushed Mass Hysteria back to its root of origin that made it a success. This album was heavier than ever, and began to close-in on the level of success of  'Contraddiction'. Two years later, in late 2009, the band released 'Failles' (cracks). The album's cover undeniably confirmed the band's renewed connection with 'contraddiction' (also in red and black). The album received critical acclaim. Original bassist, Stéphan Jaquet departed the band in 2011. He would pass away in 2021 in the age of 53.\nIn the mass media, Mass Hysteria was known for some controversies and incidents surrounding them. But some critics have also noticed the quality of their music and their growing success.\n\nIn 1998 the band played in Quebec, Montreal at the Spectrum. They recorded a live album there on 16 May. The concert hall was torn down in 2008.\nIn 2001 the band played at the Pollywog in Montreal, Québec, Canada on 11 August 2001.\nIn 2008 the band played at the Sziget Festival in Óbudai-Sziget, Budapest, Hungary on 16 August 2008.\nIn 2008 the band played at the Club Soda in Montreal, Québec, Canada on 19 August 2008.\nIn 2009 Metallica called on Mass Hysteria to open for their sold-out show at the 'Arènes de Nîmes'.\nIn 2010 the band returned to Quebec to attend a special tour along with French metal band AqME.\nIn 2010 the band played in Lörrach, Germany on 29 January.\nIn 2011 the band released its anticipated first DVD live recorded and filmed in Toulouse (southern France).\nOn 9 July 2011 the band participated at Sonisphere France along with the big four.\nIn 2011 the band played 3 dates in New Caledonia (Pacific).

    "text": "The Concord String Quartet was an American string quartet established in 1971. The members of the quartet were \nMark Sokol and \nAndrew Jennings, violins; \nJohn Kochánowski, viola;\nNorman Fischer, cello.\nThey gave their last regular concert on May 15, 1987. An anniversary concert was given in December 1996 at the Naumburg Foundation.\n\n\n== Farewell Concert Program Notes (partial) May 7, 1987 ==\nThe Concord String Quartet was born in 1971 when its members, each a\nself-professed quartet \"fanatic,\" agreed over the telephone to try forming an\nensemble. Coming from four different parts of the country – Mark from Oberlin and Seattle, \nAndy from Buffalo, John from South Bend, and Norman from\nPlymouth, Michigan – each Concord had been playing the quartet repertoire\nwith family, friends, and colleagues for many years, but none of them knew\nall three others. However, each had studied or played with the Juilliard Quartet's \nfounding violinist Robert Mann, who encouraged their aspirations\nand recommended them to each other.\nThey enrolled in a summer program for nascent string quartets at SUNY,\nBinghamton, where they met for the first time and began rehearsing with an\nawkward discord (one of them had been practicing the wrong music).\nEven as they were selecting the name Concord out of the dictionary (with\nits resonant associations – Ives' \"Concord, Mass.\" sonata; the opposite of\ndiscord), the foursome launched itself into its contemporary repertoire with\na vengeance. This was fueled by a commitment, arranged on the recommendation \nof friends, to record a three-record VOX BOX of avant-garde American\nquartets. Their intensive summer in Binghamton was broken only by their\nfirst introduction to Dartmouth in August – a two-week rehearsing residency\nfunded by the Friends of Hopkins Center which culminated with an informal\n\"thank you\" performance in Rollins Chapel.\nThe next two years saw the Concord taking part in a special program at\nSUNY, Binghamton and in a touring residency sponsored by the Hudson\nValley Philharmonic Society. Throughout that period the quartet consolidated\nits reputation as champions of contemporary American music, while exploring\nboth the well-trodden paths and the odd byways of the standard repertoire.\nTheir award-winning albums of contemporary quartets established the Concords \nat the forefront of contemporary quartet performance, and unloosed a\nsteady stream of new quartets by hopeful composers that arrived in their\nmailbox several times a week for years. For much of that time their policy\nwas to give every new work at least a quick run-through, and their commitment \nto new works has never varied. Numerous quartets have been written\nfor or dedicated to the Concords.\nEarly on, as winners of the Walter W. Naumburg Chamber Music Award\nin the fall of 1971, the Concords were entitled to commission a new quartet.\nThey chose to approach composer George Rochberg, who produced his String\nQuartet No. 3. One of the earliest works written in the then-revolutionary\n\"collage\" technique that has since been dubbed \"Neo-Romantic,\" the\nRochberg quartet, and the Concord's performances and recording of it, landed\nthem smack in the middle of an international musical controversy that continued \nthrough a seven-work association with that composer.\nIn 1974, following several more concerts at Dartmouth, then director of the\nHopkins Center Peter Smith asked the Concord to become string quartet-in-residence. \nAmong the quartets Smith considered, he wrote, the Concords \"displayed\na refreshing adventurousness in their approach to repertoire.\nmade it clear they wanted to teach and had every confidence they would\nenjoy it. Nobody could miss their energy or their basic good spirits.\"\nIn the ensuing years, the Concords not only enriched the College's and\nthe community's musical lives immensely, but continued to amass an enviable\nnational and international reputation, buoyed by well-received recordings of\nboth the standard and the non-standard repertoire. The quartet has played\nover eleven hundred concerts in forty-one states and the District of Columbia,\nthree Canadian provinces, and six other foreign countries.\nThey celebrated the end of their first three-year residency at Dartmouth\nwith a performance of the complete Beethoven quartets – considered the\npivotal challenge for any string quartet, and later performed that cycle\naround the country, including sellout Beethoven series in New York's Alice\nTully Hall in three successive seasons. They have also performed a complete\nBartok cycle, and participated in a summer devoted largely to Schubert\nchamber music.\nNever far from public sight, the Concords made news in 1976 when they\nrehearsed with composer Lukas Foss in the lounge of the Pan American\nterminal at Kennedy International Airport – the only place where the busy\nquartet and composer could cross paths during hectic touring schedules.\nThey were again in the headlines in 1982 when Jennings' Stradivarius violin\nwas stolen after a concert on Nantucket Island – and it was recovered on the\nmainland several days later.\nIn 1977 the quartet won the first of two Emmy Awards (for the New England\nRegion) for its three-part PBS broadcast \"The Concord String Quartet Plays\nBartok and Haydn.\"\nAt Dartmouth, each has held a position of Adjunct Associate Professor of\nMusic, combining teaching and instrumental instruction duties with busy\nconcert schedules. As individuals, they have performed at Dartmouth and\nthroughout the region with great frequency. Members of the quartet have\nsoloed with the Dartmouth Symphony Orchestra in major concerti, have\nappeared in solo recital, and have performed with other faculty and visiting\nartists in a variety of chamber music contexts.\nIn addition to their Beethoven, Bartok, and Schubert celebrations, other\nsignificant Dartmouth performances have included a concert of new works\nby faculty members Jon Appleton, Lauren Levey, and Christian Wolff, a\nperformance with their \"Godfather,\" Robert Mann, of some of his own music,\na continuing series devoted to Mozart quartets and quintets, and concerts\nwith celebrated guest artists including Gervase de Peyer, Richard Goode,\nClaude Monteux, Gilbert Kalish, Leslie Guinn, Menahem Pressler, Bernard\nGreenhouse, and Walter Trampler.\nLast December, the quartet announced that it would disband following the\n1986–87 concert season, so that its members could pursue other teaching and\nperforming activities that were incompatible with being a fulltime string quartet. \nThey leave the stage as one of the few world-class quartets that has\nmaintained its original membership throughout its lifetime.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAmerican String Quartets 1950–1970\nWorks:\nStefan Wolpe: String Quartet, C. 170\nEarle Brown: String Quartet\nJohn Cage: String Quartet in Four Parts\nLeon Kirchner: String Quartet No. 3 for strings & tape\nChristian Wolff: Summer for string quartet\nGeorge Crumb: Black Angels (Images I), for electric string quartet\nLejaren Hiller: String quartet No.5 (In Quarter-Tones)\nJacob Druckman: String Quartet No. 2\nMorton Feldman: Structures, for string quartet\nLabel and catalog number: VOXBOX CDX 5143 (ADD;

    "text": "Blank & Jones are a German electronic music group, consisting of Jan Pieter Blank (born June 15, 1971), known as Piet Blank; René Runge (born June 27, 1968), better known as DJ Jaspa Jones; and the producer Andy Kaufhold (N*D*K) (born December 17, 1969). They have released twelve albums and more than two dozen singles since their first single release \"Sunrise\" in 1997.\n\n\n== History ==\nPiet Blank, who became interested in music after purchasing his first record \"Kids in America\" by Kim Wilde, had his first experience spinning a record on a turntable at age 16. René Runge, who resides in Düsseldorf and who is better known as Jaspa Jones, had his first experience as a DJ at age 19. Together with help from Andy Kaufhold, they formed the trance production team Piet Blank & Jaspa Jones (which would later become simply Blank & Jones) after meeting at the Popkomm music conference.\nEven though they had been together for a few years, they did not release their first single, \"Sunrise\", until 1997. Their first album, In the Mix, was a studio production that came out in 1999. As of 2008, thirteen of their singles have made it into the German top 50, and three into the top 20. Each album made the top 50, including two which reached the top ten.\nBlank & Jones have teamed up with Robert Smith from the Cure, Anne Clark, Sarah McLachlan, Claudia Brücken from (Propaganda), Pet Shop Boys, and Delerium. They have also contributed to the Café del Mar compilation series and produced their own chill-out albums, the seven editions of the Relax series.\nThey released a single entitled \"Miracle Cure\" on May 30, 2008, off their studio album The Logic of Pleasure which is a collaboration with New Order's frontman Bernard Sumner. This collaboration was realised with the help of Berlin-based record producer Mark Reeder who is a long term friend of Sumner's. Blank & Jones invited Reeder to remix \"Miracle Cure\" and this in turn, brought about their collaboration with him and a new project was conceived. This resulted in Reeder completely reworking most of the Blank & Jones vocal tracks for the successful and highly acclaimed 2009 album Reordered.\nIn 2012, they produced a new album for German singer Sandra titled Stay in Touch.\n\n\n=== The Singles ===\nIn 2006, Blank & Jones and their long-standing production colleague Andy Kaufhold collated their finest material on one release, The Singles, which also included two new tracks:\n\nWe felt the time had come to put all our singles together on one CD, we preferred to see it as one step along the way, rather than a mere retrospective. A little breather before we moved onto new pastures ... Our aim was to retain the flair of each original track. We wanted them to sound just as they did when we made them, but clearer, in the same way as one restores a painting. You don't paint it from scratch, you just bring out the colours again.\nThe album was also released in Limited Edition format, in which The Singles are complemented by a DVD, bringing together all Blank & Jones videos on one disc for the first time. The videos feature people such as Estella Warren and Til Schweiger in \"Beyond Time\", the latter having also directed the clip. The DVD was produced and designed by Thomas Jahn, scriptwriter and director of Knocking on Heaven's Door. The video for the single \"Catch\" was directed by Conchita Soares and Toni Froschhammer which features TV actress Nadine Warmuth.\n\n\n=== So80s ===\n\nFrom 2009 to 2019, they curated a series of compilation albums featuring '80s music called So80s. The series had 24 volumes. In 2011, they curated So80s Presents Kajagoogoo. In 2012, they curated So80s albums featuring Falco and Sandra. In 2014, they curated So80s presents Alphaville.\n\n\n=== Current and past activities ===\nThe chart success of Blank & Jones is partially based on their club gigs, radio shows and other live performances including events such as Love Parade, StreetParade and Mayday. The success is further boosted by their activeness as moderators on Eins Live-TV and by being the co-hosts on Viva-Clubrotation.\nWhen asked about the key to their success, their response is:\n\nWe do everything digitally, on the basis of Final Scratch, which allows us to use our own edits and mixes, nothing comes straight from tape. Every set we play is unique, not only sound-wise but also in terms of what we play and how we play it. Roughly 60% of our set consists of our own repertoire, as where better to present our own material than via the DJ decks.\nBlank & Jones have performed at major festivals and raves in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Russia. They have also traveled further afield on a regular basis, to Canada, Mexico, South America and Australia.\nPiet Blank is also the host of the Club Mix that is aired on international flights by Lufthansa, where he hosts a two-hour radio show that shows different artists such as Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs and Fritz Kalkbrenner. The show is hosted in German as well as in English.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== As Blank and Jones ====\n1999: In da Mix\n2000: DJ Culture (Limited edition with 2 CDs.

    "text": "Madison Violet is a Juno-nominated Canadian music duo composed of singer-songwriters Brenley MacEachern and Lisa MacIsaac. The group has been notable for various folk and pop award nominations and wins.\n\n\n== History ==\nLisa MacIsaac is a fiddler, vocalist and stepdancer originally from Creignish, Cape Breton Island. She began learning to dance at the age of seven and took up the fiddle a year later. MacIsaac plays a variety of musical styles and many instruments, including piano and mandolin. She is the sister of fiddler Ashley MacIsaac.\nBrenley MacEachern, born in Montreal and raised in Kincardine, Ontario, also has Cape Breton roots. Her father is from Craigmore, Nova Scotia. Christy's Look Off in Craigmore is named after her grandmother, Christy MacEachern.\nDespite both having family ties in Creignish, MacIsaac and MacEachern first met at an artists' hangout in Toronto in the late 1990s, when MacEachern was part of the band Zoebliss. MacIsaac briefly joined that band, and the pair continued collaborating as a duo after Zoebliss broke up in 1999. The duo were originally known as Madviolet, but later changed their name to Madison Violet.\nThey released three albums independently in Canada, and then signed a record deal with True North Records for their fourth album, No Fool for Trying, and its follow-up The Good in Goodbye. The duo have toured extensively across Canada, Europe, the UK and Australia, and in 2013 released the live concert Come As You Are: Live which was filmed at the Kulturkirche in Cologne, Germany\nIn 2010, the band received a Juno nomination for Roots/Traditional album of the Year for No Fool For Trying. They were also awarded Song of the Year in the 2010 John Lennon Songwriting Contest for The Ransom, and in January 2011, Madison Violet was nominated for the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards in the Singer-Songwriter category for No Fool for Trying, and won in the category for Folk/Singer-Songwriter Song for The Ransom and Small of My Heart.\nAfter completing their contract with True North Records the band spent most of 2014 recording the followup to The Good in Goodbye. Experimenting with more pop, electronic and synth-based sounds the band signed a worldwide deal with Ultra Records to release the single These Ships (Matt James Remix) on 11 September. The new album, titled The Year of the Horse is slated for release in 2016.\nIn the summer of 2018 Madison Violet hired Mark Watson of Toronto-based Watson Entertainment as their music manager to further their musical career. Madison Violet also ended their relationship with booking agency Paquin Entertainment to work with Ryan Heerschap.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nMad Violet (2002)\nWorry the Jury (2004)\nCaravan (2006)\nNo Fool for Trying (2009)\nThe Good in Goodbye (2011)\nCome As You Are: Live (2013)\nThe Year of the Horse (2016)\nSleigh Bells in the Snow (2016 ?)\nThe Knight Sessions (2017)\nEverything’s Shifting (2019)\neleven (2022)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nLight it Up (2004)\nWake Up (2005)\nCrying (2009)\nThese Ships (Matt James Remix) (2015)\nWe Are Famous (2017)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n2005 ECMA nomination (Best New Artist)\n2005 ECMA nomination (Pop Recording of the Year / Worry The Jury)\n2007 ECMA nomination (Group Recording of the Year / Caravan)\n2008 ECMA nomination (Folk Recording of the Year / Caravan)\n2008 Canadian Folk Music Award nomination (Best Vocal Group)\n2009 Canadian Folk Award – (Best Vocal Group)\n2009 John Lennon Songwriting Contest - Song of the Year & Grand Prize Winners Folk for \"The Ransom\" \n2010 Juno Awards Nomination (Roots/Traditional Album of the Year)\n2011 Independent Music Awards Folk/Singer-songwriter Song of the year for \"The Random and Small of My Heart\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n2009 John Lennon Song Writing Contest (\"The Ransom\")\n2013 ECMA nomination (Group Recording of the Year / The Good in Goodbye)\n\n\n== External links ==\nMadison Violet"

    "text": "LMT, Grupo Límite, or Límite, is a Mexican Norteño band formed in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico in 1994. The group was led by singer Alicia Villarreal until she left to pursue a solo career.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band debuted in 1995 with the record, Por Puro Amor (sung by Beatriz Alejo Jiménez)\n, which sold over a million copies. The album featured singles such as \"Vete\", \"Quiero\", and \"Te Aprovechas.\" Other subsequent albums were successful. At the 9th Lo Nuestro Awards, Límite received two awards: Regional Mexican Group of the Year and New Artist. The group's sound and look sparked a wave of copycats in Tejano & Norteño music. Grupo Límite's lead singer/songwriter Alicia Villarreal had her own catch phrase, a flirty \"ah-hah\", which quickly became part of the groups mystique, in addition to her blonde braids.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJohanna Maldonado - Vocalist\nDayna Robles - Accordion\nKimberly Hidalgo - Keyboard\nEdith Enríquez - Guitar\nCarina García - Bass guitar\nMariah Cruz - Percussion\nLizbeth Ríos - Drums\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nLuis Mario Garza - Drums (1995-1997)\nAlicia Villarreal - Vocalist (1995-2003)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References =="

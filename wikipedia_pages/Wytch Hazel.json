Originally, the band went with the name Jerusalem which had already been taken. Wytch Hazel began with the lineup of Colin Hendra on guitars and vocals, Josh Winnard on guitars, Cornelius Corkery on bass, and Aaron Hay on drums. In 2012, the band released their debut EP, titled The Truth, which came out independently. The band released two other split releases in 2012, one titled Vol. 1, which also featured Asmovel, Eliminator, and Ascalon, and Borrowed Time / Wytch Hazel, which featured Borrowed Time. By the time the band began to write and record their debut album, a majority of the lineup changed, with Hendra and Corkery remaining, with Winnard and Hay departing, as well as Winnard's replacement Matt Gatley, also departing by 2015. Alex Haslam (Big Al) joined the band in 2015 on guitars, with Jack Spencer taking over Hay’s position in 2013. In 2016, the band released their debut album, titled Prelude, which was released through Bad Omen Records. In 2018, the band recorded and released their sophomore album, which was titled II: Sojourn, also being released through Bad Omen, and was well received. In 2020, the band released their third album, III: Pentecost, which was highly praised by several reviewers.\n\n\n== Influences, style and beliefs ==\nFounding member Colin Hendra states that Iron Maiden is one of the band's influences.\nAlex Haslam (Big Al) confirmed that other influences included Led Zeppelin, Wishbone Ash and Jethro Tull. Several reviewers compared the band to other artists like Blue Öyster Cult, Thin Lizzy, and Deep Purple.\nWhile Wytch Hazel's lyrical content is very much oriented by themes of Christianity of lyrics, written by Hendra, they do not claim to be a Christian band.

The theme is very present in a majority of their songs, with many reviewers pointing this out.\n\n\n== Members ==\nLast known line up\nColin Hendra – vocals, guitar (2011–present)\nAlex Haslam (Big Al) – guitar (2015–present)\nAndrew Shackleton – bass (2019–present)\nAaron Hay (2011-2014, 2022-present)\nFormer\nJack Spencer – drums (2014–2022)\nJosh Winnard – guitar, vocals (2011–2013)\nMatt Gatley – guitar (2013–2015)\nCornelius \"Neil\" Corkery – bass (2011–2017)\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nPrelude (2016)\nII: Sojourn (2018)\nIII: Pentecost (2020)\nIV: Sacrament (2023)\nEPs\n\nThe Truth (2012)\nStrong Heart (2023)\nSplits\n\nVol. 1 (2012)\nBorrowed Time / Wytch Hazel (2012)\nCompilations\n\nSurrender & the Truth (2013)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Wytch Hazel To Release Prelude Album In April; \"We Will Be Strong\" Track Streaming\".

Original fiddler Jules Sisk left the band, and was replaced by Dana Arrowsmith of Sudbury, Ontario.\nThe album No Regrets was produced by Brian Talbot of the band Slainte Mhath. Critic Wes Smiderle of the Ottawa Citizen wrote, \"The tone is cheerful, end-of-the-work-week acoustic venting, with lyrical nods to the rigours of East Coast history, much like Great Big Sea\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nNathan MacDonald – vocals, guitar\nTyree Lush – vocals, guitar, button accordion, mandolin\nMatt Holland – bass\nDana Arrowsmith – fiddle, vocals\n\n\n=== Nathan MacDonald ===\nNathan Bishop MacDonald better known as \"Nathan Bishop\" is a singer-songwriter based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

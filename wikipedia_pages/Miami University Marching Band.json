    "text": "The Miami University Marching Band (MUMB) is the marching band of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Founded in 1935,\nthe band is an organization which fields 220 students enrolled in the Miami University system. The band is a part of the College of Creative Arts and the Department of Music, representing the students of the college at all home football games, as well as at various away games, bowl games, parades, and marching band festivals.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Miami University Marching Band was formed in 1935 by A.D. Lekvold, the first director of bands from 1936 to 1960. Their first uniforms consisted of white trousers, red capes, and red coats. During the 1950s, the band fielded 96 members and would take annual road trips to Bowling Green State University, Ohio University, and the University of Cincinnati. Additionally, around this time the Shakerettes, drill team, and majorettes first appeared.\nUnder Nicholas Poccia, the band was enlarged from 96 to 144 students. Over 200 people were involved as either a field marcher or an alternate.\nThe late 60's brought the marching band new uniforms consisting of blue uniforms with a big 'M' on the front and an Indian on the back. In 1971, the Miami Marching Machine came into existence. The Marching Machine was built by Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma, and was a birthday gift to Mr. Poccia from the marching band. The Marching Machine was a tank-like structure placed over Dr. Clay, the Tuba instructor's, Volkswagen, and it became the mascot of the band. It was always at the head of all the parades and even made an appearance at a Cincinnati Bengals game. The Marching Machine remained an integral part of the marching band until 1979.\nIn 1978, Dr. Jack Liles became director of the band. Dr. Liles made a significant impact on the style of marching the band would use. MUMB adapted the current drum corps style, in contrast to the prior dance style of marching. The color guard and front pit were introduced to the band, keeping with current trends in marching bands around the nation. The 1980s were a huge growth period for the band, not only in quantity, but quality.\nIn 1999, Mr. David Shaffer was appointed director of the marching band. During Mr. Shaffer's tenure as director, the Marching Band performed at the 2003 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and 2 Football Bowl games. In 2009, he was succeeded by  Dr. Stephen Lytle, who led the band in performances with jazz legend Benny Golson as well as appearances in the 2010 Frozen Four, the 2010 MAC Football Championship, the 2011 GoDaddy.com Bowl, the 2011 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the 57th Presidential Inaugural Parade, and the 2016 St. Petersburg Bowl. Dr. Brooke Johnson was appointed interim director in 2018 and gained the position of Director of Athletic Bands in 2019.\n\n\n== Instrumentation ==\n\nThe Miami University Marching Band consists of about 270 members, featuring brass, woodwinds, battery, and a pit percussion section. Baton twirlers, a color guard, and a dance team (called the Shakerettes) also perform with the band.\n\n\n=== Directors ===\nA.D.

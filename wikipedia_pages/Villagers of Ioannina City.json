    "text": "Villagers of Ioannina City (VIC) is a folk rock band from Ioannina, Greece, formed in 2007. They play post, stoner and psychedelic rock with a large dose of Greek folk music from the region of Epirus. The regional musical tradition is characterized by polyphony, specific rhythms and tunes, and the use of clarinet, kaval, and bagpipe. The band fuses this unique folk music with modern psychedelic forms, creating a sound where the dominant solo instrument is the clarinet. They have played in the biggest rock festivals and in numerous sold-out shows in the biggest music scenes in Greece.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nAlex (Alex Karametis) – guitar, vocals\nAkis (Akis Zois) – bass\nAris (Aris Giannopoulos) – drums\nKonstantis (Konstantis Pistiolis) – clarinet, kaval, backing vocals\nKostas (Konstantinos Lazos) – bagpipe, winds\nPast members: Giannis Haldoupis, Achilleas Radis\n\n\n== Discography ==\nPromo 2010, April 2010, self-released\nRiza (\"root\" in Greek), April 2014, Mantra Records\nZvara/Karakolia EP, November 2014, Mantra Records\nAge of Aquarius, 2019, Mantra Records\n\n\n== Sources ==\n2020 Album Review – Blabbermouth\n2020 Album Review – Metal Temple\nMetal Storm\n2020 Album Review – Metal Hammer\n\n\n== External links ==\nFacebook page\nWebsite"

    "text": "(G)I-dle (Korean: (여자)아이들; RR: Yeoja Aideul; lit. Girls Idol; stylized in all caps) is a South Korean girl group formed by Cube Entertainment in 2018. The group consists of five members: Miyeon, Minnie, Soyeon, Yuqi, and Shuhua. The group was originally a sextet, until Soojin left the group on August 14, 2021. They are praised for their musicality, versatility, and for breaking stereotypes as a \"self-producing\" idol group, known for writing and producing much of their material. Since their debut, they have been acknowledged as one of the most successful South Korean girl groups outside of the \"big four\" record labels.\n(G)I-dle debuted with the extended play I Am and its single \"Latata\" on May 2, 2018. After several moderately successful releases, the group rose to prominence with \"Tomboy\", the viral lead single of their first studio album I Never Die (2022). The song was a critical and commercial success, peaking at number one on the Circle Digital Chart. Their next single, \"Nxde\", also topped the chart and made (G)I-dle the only artist to have two songs achieve a perfect all-kill in 2022. It also made them the first act from an independent label to debut on the US Billboard Pop Airplay chart with a non-English song.\n(G)I-dle's sixth EP, I Feel (2023), produced the single \"Queencard\", which marked the group's third consecutive number-one single in South Korea. The album became their first to sell over one million copies in South Korea, and sold two million copies worldwide in 2023 according to the IFPI. The group's second studio album, 2 (2024), was also met with commercial success and sold over one million copies in South Korea. It yielded the top-ten lead single \"Super Lady\" and the number-one song \"Fate\", which found success despite not being released as a single.\n\n\n== Name ==\nIn an interview with The Star, group leader Soyeon revealed that the name \"Idle\" (아이들) came to her when she was composing the \"Idle Song\". She suggested it to Cube Entertainment, and the name was finalized after undergoing internal competition. However, the name received mixed reactions in South Korea and internationally since \"아이들\" (aideul) means \"children\", and \"idle\" in English refers to someone who avoids work. Accordingly, the group was renamed (G)I-dle, with the \"I\" standing for individuality, the hyphen showing that the name has been divided into two parts, and \"Dle\" (deul) as the plural form of \"I\" in Korean to indicate a group of six different personalities gathering together. When the name is stated aloud, the \"G\" enclosed in parentheses is not included. Following their return as a quintet, on an episode of 1theK Original's IDDP released on the March 15, 2022, the group confirmed they would like to be referred to verbally as \"I-dle\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut activities ===\n\nSoyeon was a female trainee who represented Cube Entertainment in the survival show Produce 101, peaking at 20th place on the final episode.

According to industry specialists and marketing researchers, the group was noted to embody the spirit a group like 2NE1 once had, adapted to today's sensibilities.\nThe group has been recognized for being a \"self-producing\" idol group, breaking stereotypes of female idols with their unique concepts, and their vocal colours. The youngest group to appear on Queendom, the members were actively involved in conceptualizing their own music videos, jacket photoshoots, song arrangements, choreography, and outfits. Instead of appealing to the opposite sex with their femininity, (G)I-dle instead cultivated a fanbase, collectively referred to as \"Neverland\", backed by a high number of women and girls; around 70% of listeners of \"Oh My God\" on Melon were female.\nNatalie Morin from Refinery29 described (G)I-dle as a group of individuals with different but complementary energies. She called them \"bold and sensual\", characteristics which she opined set them apart from other K-pop girl groups. Mor.bo complemented their sonic diversity and willingness to try different musical styles. Elle magazine named the group \"independent musicians and artists\", contrary to typical girl groups' concepts that work within a mould made by someone else. Idology describes the members of (G)I-dle as \"good actors, which is something that idols need to be in order to express a variety of stories and emotions\" with \"a strong determination to show something different and benefited from being able to produce themselves\". Chun Yoon-Hye of Herald Pop called (G)I-dle \"a group filled with skills and confidence\" who \"engraved their presence by successfully expressing their exceptional concepts during Queendom\" and \"gone from super rookie to trending girl group\". Choi Ji-sun, a pop music critic and author, discussed how the music industry limited idols, especially female ones, and named (G)I-dle and their performance of \"Lion\" on Mnet's Queendom as an example of change. Choi praised the song as a \"rare case of calling a female wild beast\" and stating that he enjoyed \"Soyeon's leading creativity\" and how they were \"integrating the message and the stage\". BBC World Service named the group as one of girl groups breaking gender stereotypes.\n\n\n=== Influences ===\n(G)I-dle revealed that they deem Hyuna, then their labelmate and senior, as a role model in May 2018. Yuqi stated, \"I grew up dreaming of becoming a singer after seeing Hyuna sunbae-nim. I want to become a sexy and cute singer like [her]. My mother played her music during preschool. That seems to have influenced me.\" Shuhua also noted, \"Since I was young, I loved dancing with my friends. I want to stand on stage together.\" (G)I-dle also revealed that a group whom they respect and were influenced by them as an artist is the South Korean boy band BTS, \"who helped and introduced so many people to so many artists — We would like to also strive for a similar path.\"\n\n\n=== Musical style, themes, and stage ===\n(G)I-dle's songs have explored many genres, including various styles of moombahton (\"Latata\", \"Hann (Alone)\", and \"Dumdi Dumdi\"), Latin pop (\"Senorita\"), boom bap (\"Uh-Oh\"), and urban hip hop (\"Oh My God\"). In the idol industry saturated with songs with themes of love and farewell, the group's song \"Lion\" diverges from the characteristics of a typical girl group song with lyrics that compare one's dignity to that of a lion. On I Trust, the group further experimented with elements of EDM trap, hip hop and urban music, with themes of self-love and self-trust. Taylor Glasby of MTV noted that (G)I-dle songs are \"steeped in their very essence—a girl's complex, internal house of mirrors constantly being broken, assessed, understood, and remade, where one style or sound is never enough to reflect who they are.\" She praised the group's eclectic musical identity and how their lyrics \"push back\" and can be either \"can be boring nonchalance or sharpening desire\". Writing for Herald Pop, Kim Na-yul stated that (G)I-dle's music can only be performed by them and that they made a good impression on the public.\nMelon's magazine described (G)I-dle's unique music as their \"most powerful weapon.\" Korea JoongAng Daily journalist Yoo Seong-woon complimented the group for blending elements from different sources into a unique mix of concepts and creating something new and fresh for the K-pop idol scene. Divyansha Dongre of Rolling Stone India pointed out that \"Symbolism is a staple in (G)I-dle's discography\" it would be \"incomplete without deep symbolism and metaphors\". He describes that \"Hwaa['s] chronological advancement from winter to bloom and fire effortlessly symbolizes the journey of a heartbroken person who gradually opened up to the idea of love again.\" and the symbolism and metaphors in \"Lion\"'s music video. \"Dumdi Dumdi\" was praised as having carried the legacy of summer songs.

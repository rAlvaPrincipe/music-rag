In addition, the band has played provincially and nationally including the Oktoberfest celebration and parade in Kitchener-Waterloo and the Vanier Cup at Toronto's Skydome.\nThe Band has also played in venues across North America including the United States Military Academy, the United States Naval Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, Disney World, and the Canadian Embassy in Washington D.C.\nAs the largest volunteer band in the Canadian Forces, the RMC Band receives its instruction from professional military musicians.

While a band with full brass and woodwind instrumentation was initially desired, there was an insufficient number of cadet musicians and so it was decided to pursue a smaller ensemble. Staff member Sgt. Paquin was added to help the formation of the early band.\nIn December 1952, the necessary equipment arrived at the college and the first public appearance of the Royal Military College of Canada Pipes and Drums took place in both RMC gymnasiums at the Sports Night in January 1953. Notable events this year include the band playing music in the Stone Frigate at reveille, leading the Cadet Wing during the college's annual Church parade, playing at sporting events and playing at the final ceremonial parade of the year.\nIn 1954, the band was devoted mainly to reorganization, rebuilding and practice in the drafting room and Kingston Armouries under the direction of C.F.L. Hewitt. Through the Staff Advisor, Captain Botting, the band was permitted sufficient time for practices. Since the experience and talent of the founding cadets was lost to the band through graduation, half of this year's band were playing for the first time.\nMore musicians were added this year to help increase the band size. Royal Roads Military College provided RMC with four pipers and a drummer while Royal Military College Saint-Jean provided a piper.

The band played relatively simple tunes such as 'Scotland the Brave'. The band continued to lead for the college's church parades.\nIn 1956, the Pipe Band was authorized for the college and was under process of formation and training being guided by the padre, Major Jack Armstrong.

    "text": "The Western Australia Police Pipe Band (WAPOL) is an Australian competitive pipe band organization based in Perth, Western Australia associated with the Western Australia Police.\n\n\n== History ==\n \nThe original Western Australia Police Band was a brass band between 1902 and 1925. The WA Police Pipe Band, now commonly known as and referred to as WAPOL, was formed in 1966.\nThe band won the Grade 2 title at the World Pipe Band Championships in 1998, and was promoted to Grade 1 at the end of the season. It is currently the only Australian competitive pipe band, sanctioned in competition by the Western Australia Police.\nAt the World Championships in 2004 the band qualified for the final and came 11th overall.\nAs of August 2016, WAPOL are the current Australian and South Pacific Grade 1 champions, having won this biennial national competition in 2012 and 2014 and are also the reigning WA Grade 1 Champions.\nIn 2004, the WA Police allowed civilians to become members of the police pipe band alongside officers, and as of 2019, most members of the WA Police pipe band are civilians, and therefore not police officers.\nIn 2020, the band made the decision to form a youth development program to encourage local interest in learning bagpipes and Scottish drumming.\n\n\n== Pipe majors ==\nJames Murray (2012-2019)\nStuart Robertson (Acting 2019-2020)\nAlisdair McLaren (2020–2022)\nChris McDonald  (2022-present)\n\n\n== Leading drummers ==\nGary Potter (2017-2020)\nDavid Johnston (2020–2021)\nGary Potter (2021-present)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nSeolauh Ur (1996)\nMusic of the Gael (1998)\nOff Duty (2000)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

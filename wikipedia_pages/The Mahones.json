    "text": "The Mahones are a  Canadian Irish punk band, formed on St. Patrick's Day in 1990, in Kingston, Ontario.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe Mahones were formed in 1990 by Dublin-born Finny McConnell, as a one-off band for a St. Patrick's Day party. Encouraged by a positive reception, McConnell decided to pursue the band full-time. The Mahones have released thirteen albums to date with their most recent, Jameson Street, being released in 2022 being named the top celtic punk album of the year and have continually received high praise for their energetic live show ever since.\nThe Mahones’ music has been featured in several major motion pictures. They co-wrote and recorded the title track for the 1996 film Celtic Pride with Dan Aykroyd. Their song \"100 Bucks\" was featured in the 1998 film Dog Park. Their song \"Paint The Town Red\" was featured in the climactic final fight scene of the 2010 Oscar Award-winning film The Fighter.  Their song \"A Little Bit of Love\" is in the 2011 film Irvine Welsh's Ecstasy.\nThe Mahones have shared stages and toured with bands such as Dropkick Murphys, Stiff Little Fingers, Shane MacGowan and The Popes, Billy Bragg, Chuck Ragan, UK Subs, Sick of It All, The Defects, Agnostic Front, The Buzzcocks, D.O.A., Against Me, The Tragically Hip, Crash Vegas, The Damned, Suicidal Tendencies, The Prodigy, Gwar, Skunk Anansie, Blue Rodeo, Steve Earle, The Alarm, Sinéad O'Connor, Roger Miret and the Disasters, Dylan Walshe, Flogging Molly, Spirit of the west, The Dubliners, Christy Moore, The Band and Van Morrison. The band’s cited influences included The Clash, The Pogues, Greenland Whalefishers, The Who, and Hüsker Dü. The group’s lineup has changed a number of times, with McConnell as the main constant member. Pogues members Terry Woods and Phil Chevron joined the band on tour in 2003.\nIn 1999, bassist Joe Chithalen died in Amsterdam shortly after a concert. He had accidentally ingested food containing peanuts, to which he was allergic. The Joe Chithalen Memorial Musical Instrument Lending Library, Joe’s M.I.L.L., was established in Kingston soon after by Wally High. The Mahones perform fundraising concerts for Joe's M.I.L.L. annually.\nIn 2010, The Mahones started their own record label, Whiskey Devil Records, and signed a distribution deal with eOne Music.\nIn 2014, The Mahones were nominated Best Punk Band at the Sirius XM Indie Awards. In 2012, The Mahones' album The Black Irish won the Independent Music Award for Best Punk Album, and Angels & Devils won Paddy Rock Radio's album of the year, as well as Vandala Concepts' album of the year \nIn 2016, Scruffy Wallace joined as the band bagpipe player. Wallace was a member of Dropkick Murphys for 12 years.\nAdvertising for the band's 2023/2024 \"The Last Call At The Bar\" tour indicated that this would be the group's final tour.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe Mahones cite The Pogues as a main influence. That band were originally called Pogue Mahone (an anglicisation of an Irish phrase meaning \"kiss my arse\"), but later shortened it to The Pogues. \"The Mahones\" is seen as similarly derived from Pogue Mahone, as a tribute to The Pogues.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\n\nFinny McConnell - lead vocals, guitar, mandolin, songwriter\nGuillaume Lauzon (The Brains, Ccomfortt)- drums\nSean \"R!ot\" Ryan - bass,  vocals\nMichael O'Grady - tin whistle, vocals\nStephen McGrath - drums\nFormer members \n\nKatie \"Kaboom\" McConnell - accordion, vocals\nDom Whelan - drums\nGuillaume Lauzon - drums\nScruffy Wallace - bagpipes\nChris Ward\nColm McConnell\nPaul Mancuso\n\"The\" Barry Williams\nAndrew Brown\nGer O'Sullivan\nMauro Sepe\nOwen Warnica\nDavid Allen\nKevan Williams\nPaddy Concannon\nMiranda Mulholland\nChris Scahill\nChris Smirnios\nGreg McConnell\nEwen McIntosh\nJoe Chithalen\nSean Winter\nEryk Chamberland\nMike Franey\nJamie Oliver (Drummer)\nArlyn Bradley (bass)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\n\n=== Demo ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

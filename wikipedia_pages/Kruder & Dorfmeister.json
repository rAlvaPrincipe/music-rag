    "text": "Kruder & Dorfmeister, named after members Peter Kruder and Richard Dorfmeister, is an Austrian duo, known for their trip hop/downtempo remixes of pop, hip hop and drum and bass songs.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1993, they released their first EP G-Stoned featuring the hypnotic \"High Noon\" and a cover resembling Simon & Garfunkel's Bookends to critical acclaim especially from the UK. Gilles Peterson played the track at first on his BBC show Worldwide.\nIn 2007, the duo were commissioned by Nokia to create a set of ringtones and sounds for its luxury Nokia 8800 Arte and Nokia 8800 Sapphire Arte phones.\n2010 marked the 16th anniversary of Kruder & Dorfmeister and their record label G-Stone Recordings which resulted in the release of the Sixteen F**king Years Of G-Stone Recordings compilation and the development of the K&D Sessions Live show. The show included visuals by longtime G-Stone VJ collaborator Fritz Fitzke and MC performances by Earl Zinger and MC Ras T-Weed. With performances at The Big Chill, Berlin Festival and other large festivals, the K&D Sessions Live show became successful and a world tour ensued.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1993 – G-Stoned (EP, G-Stone Recordings)\n1996 – Conversions: A K&D Selection (Spray Records/Shadow Records)\n1996 – DJ-Kicks: Kruder & Dorfmeister (Studio !K7)\n1996 – Black Baby (EP, !K7)\n1998 – The K&D Sessions (!K7)\n2002 – G-Stone Book (Label compilation)\n2008 – Shakatakadoodub (EP, G-Stone, online only)\n2010 – Sixteen F**king Years Of G-Stone Recordings (Label compilation)\n2013 – Akte Grüninger, sound by Richard Dorfmeister\n2020 – Johnson\n2020 – 1995\n\n\n== Aliases ==\nTosca (Dorfmeister with Rupert Huber)\nDiscography\nPeace Orchestra (Kruder)\n1999 – Peace Orchestra (G-Stone)\n2002 – Reset (G-Stone/Studio !K7)\nRichard Dorfmeister vs. Madrid de los Austrias (Heinz Tronigger & Michael \"Pogo\" Kreiner)\n2004 – Valldemossa (Sunshine Enterprises)\n2006 – \"Boogie No More\" (EP, Net's Work International)\n2006 – Grand Slam (G-Stone)\n2006 – \"Valldemossa Remixed\" (EP, Sunshine Enterprises)\nVoom:Voom (Kruder with Christian Prommer and Roland Appel)\n2000 – \"Poppen / Influenza\" (EP, Compost Records)\n2001 – \"Ginger & Fred / Influenza Forte\" (EP, Compost)\n2003 – \"Baby 3\" (EP, Compost)\n2006 – PengPeng (Studio !K7)\n\n\n== References =="

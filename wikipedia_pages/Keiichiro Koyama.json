    "text": "Keiichiro Koyama (小山 慶一郎, Koyama Keiichirō, born 1 May 1984) is a Japanese musician and leader of the Starto Entertainment group NEWS.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKoyama was born in Sagamihara, Kanagawa as the youngest of two children.\nIn 2007, he graduated from Meiji University's Department of History and Geography with a degree in Oriental History.\n\n\n== Career ==\nUpon entering Johnny's Entertainment on 21 January 2001, Koyama started out with the unit B.A.D. which stands for Beautiful American Dream. His second unit as a junior was B.B.D. which at first stood for Bad Boys Dancing, but was later changed to Best Beat Dancing. In October 2001, he was chosen as a member of Domoto Koichi's project, J-Support, alongside future fellow NEWS members Hironori Kusano and Shigeaki Kato. It was in this unit that Koyama started out as an announcer for shows such as the Ya-Ya-yah Show, and this has carried through to NEWS. \nHe is the oldest member of NEWS, which debuted in September 2003, and is often seen as the mother figure of the group.\nFrom 2006 until March 2011, he hosted NHK's popular TV variety show Shounen Club (Boys Club) alongside KAT-TUN member Nakamaru Yuichi. The pair shared the screen 6 years later in Fuji TV's variety special program \"Otasuke JAPAN\", which aired on 14 June 2017. \nHe could be seen as a newscaster on NTV's \"News Every\", from 2010 until 2018.\nKoyama learned sign language to interact with hearing-impaired children when he hosted NTV's \"24 Hour TV\" telethon in 2009, obtaining a test level 4.\nHe also occasionally participated in dramas, such as Fuji TV \"Ns' Aoi\" and \"0-gōshitsu no kyaku\", as well as guest starring in his bandmate Yamashita Tomohisa's drama Kurosagi.\nKoyama opened a personal Twitter on 17 March 2023, and an official website on 22 February 2024.\n\n\n== Scandal ==\nOn 8 June 2018, Koyama's entertainment career was halted. He attended a party where he gave an underage girl alcohol. The drinking age in Japan is 20 years old, and while she said she was 20 and legally able to drink, it was later discovered that she was in fact younger. This put his entire career on hold, including his entertainment activities with Johnny's Entertainment and his job as a newscaster for the program \"News Every.\"\nAs of 27 June 2018, Koyama has resumed his entertainment activities. In December 2018, Koyama left the program \"News Every.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAccording to acquaintances, Koyama is to marry AAA's Misako Uno by the end of 2024. The couple met through friends, and started dating by fall 2022. Koyama didn't deny the relationship when interviewed by Bunshun. According to said acquaintances (and as reported by Bunshun), both have been sharing their living spaces, semi-cohabitating, with the previous approval of family and agencies.\nKoyama announced his marriage to AAA's Misako Uno on March 12, 2024. They registered their marriage on March 12, which is also the birthday of Uno's beloved father, who died in January of 2023.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Dramas ===\nKanojo ga Shinjyatta (彼女が死んじゃった) (2004)\nUnlucky Deizu: Natsume no Bōsō  (2004)\nKurosagi (Episode 2 only) (2006)\nNs' Aoi (Ns'あおい) (2006)\nHana Yome wa Yakudoshi (2006)\nYukan Club (Episode 6 only) (2007)\nLoss:Time:Life (ロス：タイム：ライフ) (Episode 2 only) (2008)\nGuests of Room 0 (0号室の客) ( 5th story ) (2010)\nLucky Seven (2012)\nKey person of interest detective (重要参考人探偵)(2017)\nZero: Ikkaku Senkin Game (ゼロ 一獲千金ゲーム) (Episode 9–10) (2018)\nTakasugi-san's Obento (高杉さん家のおべんとう) (2024) as Harumi Takasugi\n\n\n=== Stage performances ===\nHigh School Musical (2007) as Troy Bolton\nLoss:Time:Life (2008)\nCall (2009)\nRoom 0 (2010) as Shigeto Oyama\nHello, Goodbye (2012) as Kumagai Ango\nGreat Nature (2015) as Shinozaki\n\n\n=== Variety shows ===\nYa-Ya-yah (TV Tokyo, 2003–2007)\nHi!

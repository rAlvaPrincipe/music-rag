    "text": "Ostara is a British folk music group, \"described in the musical press as a neo-folk / pop music hybrid\", founded by Richard Leviathan (born Richard Levy) and Timothy Jenn, as a change of name and stylistic direction from their previous band, Strength Through Joy. Jenn left the band in 2001. Guitarist Stu Mason, drummer Tim Desmond, and former Bronski Beat/Communards bassist Dave Renwick left the band in 2010, as work was due to start on a new album. Leviathan is now the only member of the band. Finnish musician Kari Hatakka, known as the singer of the band Waltari, played synthesizers on some Ostara tracks.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSecret Homeland (2000)\nKingdom Gone (2002)\nUltima Thule (2003)\nImmaculate Destruction (2005)\nThe Only Solace (2009)\nParadise Down South (2014)\nNapoleonic Blues (2017)\nEclipse of the West (2020)\nAge of Empire (2023)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nWhispers of the Soul (2001)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site"

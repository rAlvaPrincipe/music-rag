It was composed of 2,000 infantrymen, among whom were already present hired musicians enlisted by the Duke of Zweibrücken, first corps commander. \nOn January 1, 1791, by decision of the Constituent Assembly, it lost its royal identity to transform itself into the 99th infantry regiment in which generations of Lyonnais served. Over the years, the regimental music has become part of the local landscape and has followed the various developments of the Army to successively become: \n\nMusic of the GMR5 (regional resources group No. 5)\nMusic of the 22nd infantry regiment\nMusic of the 22nd infantry battalion\nMusic of the South-East Land Region\nMusic of the infantry\nMusic of the artillery.\nProud of this heritage, the artillery music took its current name on September 1, 2016, the date on which it was integrated into the Army music command. But it is undoubtedly under the name \"music of the 9-9\" that it remains in the hearts and collective unconscious of all the Rhône-Alpes.\n\n\n=== Notable activities ===\nThe Musique de L’Artillerie gives the Concert of the Military Governor of Lyon every year, for the benefit of army casualties in front of a parterre of 2000 people.\nIn August 2011, it took part in the Ystad International Military Tattoo.\nIn June 2013, it took part in the Sevastopol International Arts Festival.\nIn January 2016, the band accompanied a ceremonial contingent from the 35th Infantry Regiment on the Rajpath in New Delhi for the 67th Indian Republic Day parade.\nIn July 2019, the band took part in the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArmy Music Command\nMusique des troupes de Marine\nParachute Band\nFrench Army Signals Band\nMusique de l'Arme Blindée Cavalerie\nInfantry Band\n\n\n== References =="

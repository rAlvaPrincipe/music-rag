    "text": "Cash Cash is an American DJ trio from Roseland, New Jersey. The group consists of three DJs / musicians: brothers Jean Paul and Alex Makhlouf and Samuel Frisch. They produce, record, mix and master all their music together as a trio.  The group's highest-charting song to date is their RIAA platinum-certified single \"Take Me Home\", which features vocals by Bebe Rexha. Throughout their career, they have released a wide range of original songs featuring diverse artists such as, John Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls, Nelly, Wiz Khalifa, Lukas Graham, Andy Grammer, Christina Perri, Busta Rhymes, Dashboard Confessional, among many others.\nOver the years, Cash Cash released music on various record labels. They were first discovered in 2008 by Universal Republic Records, where they released their debut full length album. Following their departure from Universal Music in 2010, they released music on various independent labels such as Spinnin' Records and their own label \"Cash Cash Music.\" From 2013–2021, they exclusively released all of their original music through Big Beat Records and Atlantic Records, a subsidiary of Warner Music Group worldwide.  On August 26, 2022, Cash Cash announced on their social media platforms that they had parted ways with their longtime record label Big Beat / Atlantic Records and posted a video in the New York Sony Music office signing a new record deal with Ultra Records & Sony Music Entertainment.\nAs of 2022, the group has released five full-length albums, an array of EPs and singles, and co-wrote, produced, and featured on Pink's charting single \"Can We Pretend.\" Aside from their original music, Cash Cash has provided official remixes for worldwide artists such as Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Bruno Mars and various others as well as produced and co-wrote Krewella's charting single \"Live for the Night.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years (2002–2007) ===\nCash Cash members Jean Paul Makhlouf and Samuel Frisch first began playing together under the name The Consequence in 2002. As The Consequence, the band put out three releases independently, Your Own Place (2004), The Consequence (2005), and By The Bedside (2006). The band went through various keyboardists and drummers before solidifying the group with Alexander Makhlouf and drummer Anthony Villacari in 2007.\n\n\n=== Take It to the Floor (2008–2010) ===\nIn early 2008, the group coalesced under the name Cash Cash, with members Jean Paul Makhlouf, Alexander Makhlouf, and Samuel Frisch. They came up with the name Cash Cash due to legal issues that arose from not trademarking their previous name 'The Consequence'. In an interview Jean Paul stated, \"Basically we were in a previous group growing up and never thought to copyright the name because when you're a young local garage band, you don't have the money and don't think it really matters. Well after we signed our first record deal, it kind of did matter. We got hit with a ton of legal notices about it from the person who owned the name, and had this old agent trying to screw us over, so when putting the new group together out of frustration, I was like, we should just name this group 'Cash Cash' because every one is after our cash, and we don't have any yet.\"\nThey signed with Universal Republic Records and soon after released an EP, Cash Cash, which reached number 24 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. In 2008, the group toured with groups such as Tyga, Metro Station, Boys Like Girls, The White Tie Affair, and Forever The Sickest Kids. Their debut full-length album Take It to the Floor was released digitally on December 23, 2008, on iTunes by Universal Republic Records and physically on January 20, 2009, reaching number 31 on the Heatseekers chart. During the winter of 2008 and 2009, the group did a Hot Topic in-store tour with We The Kings and Hey Monday, performing acoustic songs and doing signings. In April 2009, Cash Cash toured with Kevin Rudolf, Hyper Crush, and Jeremy Greene on the Let it Rock tour. Cash Cash played the main stage at Bamboozle in May 2009 and then toured the United Kingdom opening for Cobra Starship. That summer they performed on the Vans Warped Tour. In fall of 2009 they toured with Family Force 5 and Breathe Carolina.\nIn late 2009 and 2010, the group released several singles which were not part of an album or EP release, including a cover of Cascada's single \"Everytime We Touch\" featuring rapper MC Oz. The group continued to tour through the winter of 2009, playing the Seattle Kiss FM show \"Jingle Bell Bash\" with The All-American Rejects, Cobra Starship, and All Time Low. At the end of February and into the spring of 2010, the group went on their first headlining United States tour, \"The Robots in Hightops Tour.\" On March 9, 2010, Cash Cash released a cover single of the Alphaville song \"Forever Young\". The band released a new single in mid-November 2010 by Universal Republic Records titled \"Red Cup (I Fly Solo)\", featuring Lacey Schwimmer and Spose.

Both of these tracks would later be remixed for the Sonic 30th Anniversary Symphony in 2021 and then used in Sonic Colors: Ultimate later in the same year.\n\n\n=== Love or Lust and The Beat Goes On (2011–2012) ===\nTheir second full-length album, Love or Lust, was released on April 19, 2011, by the Japanese label Twilight Records.

Hip Online referred to the group's early releases as technopop, while AllMusic classified Take It to the Floor as electronic, pop rock and emo pop. AllMusic further described the album as \"[f]illed with [processed] vocals, old-school synths, singalong choruses, [and] slick-as-oil vocal harmonies.\" PopMatters noted the album's \"standard emo-pop elements\" and opined that the group's style \"suggest[s] Fall Out Boy with some synthy window dressing.\" Jean-Paul described the band's early style as an attempt to \"Bring back some of that 70s funk guitar, mixed in with the life and fun of the 80s.\" USA Today, in a later assessment, noted that the group's early work \"has always had a dance-music sensibility, but starting out, they were lumped into the alt-rock scene.\"\nOver the course of the early 2010s, the group began moving away from standard band instrumentation and began incorporating more elements of electronic dance music. In an interview with EDM Sauce, they talk about their transition being facilitated by frequent production and remixing on the side. Cash Cash stated, \"I think for us it was a slow evolution, because we were always remixing and producing for other artists and doing outside production.\" In another interview with Only The Beat, the group stated, \"When we first started as a band our sound was \"poppy\", but we always had underlying electronic elements to our music. Once we started changing and growing, our sound slowly began evolving.\" The group's 2011 album Love or Lust was described by Under the Gun Review as \"dance/power pop...full of bass rhythms, synthetic claps, techno beats, and dance/party/club themes\". Following releases and remixes were also received as electronica and electropop.\nCash Cash's first RIAA certified song \"Take Me Home\" has been categorized by as a progressive house dance song. Dancing Astronaut described the Overtime EP's electro house qualities by stating the group is \"gracing the world with a dose of electro house and dubbed-out tunes.\" Songs off the Overtime EP such as \"Here and Now\" and \"Satellites\" have been classified as house or its subgenre electro house. Dancing Astronaut further elaborated on the sound of the release by stating, \"The EP continues with a bright feel, boosted by the unique blend of fluorescent synths and dirty bass.\" Other Cash Cash originals such as \"Kiss The Sky\" and \"Overtime\" along with their remix of \"Treasure\" by Bruno Mars have been labeled by electronic music blogs as nu-disco and glitch hop. Throughout 2014, the group's subsequent singles \"Lightning\" and \"Surrender\" were also reviewed as progressive house and electro house.\n\n\n== Production equipment and software ==\nIn 2013, Cash Cash stated in their The Huffington Post interview that they produce their music using Steinberg's Cubase as their digital audio workstation. In another interview with EDM blog \"Notable Dance,\" the group stated \"We use Cubase as a host for everything but we mess around in Ableton.\" In a studio video released in May 2013, the group discussed various equipment and gear they use, including a vintage Roland Juno-D, Avalon AD2022 preamp, Empirical Labs Distressor, Joe Meek Twin Q, and Neumann TLM 49. During the video they speak about owning a few discontinued Samson D-1500 real time analyzers. Their speaker set up consists of Adam A8X's and a pair of mix cubes that are A/B controlled by a PreSonus Central Station. The producer trio recently added a Neumann U 87 to their studio set up as well.\n\n\n== Members ==\nDuring the group's early days as a band, they operated & signed their first record deal as a four-piece band. For their first three years signed to Universal Republic Records they also toured with a live touring musician on guitar & back up vocals. Around mid 2011, the group shifted their focus to electronic production, collaborating with outside artists, remixing songs, and using electronic drums instead of a drummer which ultimately led to the departure of their original drummer Anthony Villacari.\n\nCurrent members\nJean Paul Makhlouf – vocals, guitar, production (2002–present)\nAlexander Luke Makhlouf – keyboards, vocoder, talk box, production, programming (2002–present)\nSamuel Warren Frisch – bass guitar, backing vocals, production, programming (2002–present)\nFormer members\nAnthony Villacari – drums (2007–2011)\nFormer touring musicians\nMike Doerr – guitar, backup vocals (2007–2009)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\n\nTake It to the Floor (2008)\nLove or Lust (2011)\nThe Beat Goes On (2012)\nBlood, Sweat & 3 Years (2016)\nSay It Like You Feel It (2021)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== Electronic Dance Music Awards ===\n\n\n=== International Dance Music Awards ===\n\n\n=== MTV Buzzworthy ===\n\n\n=== Radio Disney Music Awards ===\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

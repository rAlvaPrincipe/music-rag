    "text": "Alphabeat were a Danish pop band from Silkeborg, fronted by singers Stine Bramsen and Anders Stig Gehrt Nielsen. Their single \"Fascination\" was a major hit in Denmark during the summer of 2006, as well as the United Kingdom in 2008. Their 2007 eponymous debut album reached number two in Denmark and was certified Platinum. Following its wide release in Europe in 2008, retitled This is Alphabeat, it reached number ten in the UK and was certified Gold in the region. The album also contains their first number one hit in Denmark, \"10.000 Nights of Thunder\".\nIn 2009, Alphabeat released the album The Spell; the song of the same name was a number one hit in Denmark. The Spell was reissued as The Beat Is... in the UK in 2010. They went on to release the albums Express Non-Stop (2012), and Don't Know What's Cool Anymore (2019). They have amassed 11 top twenty singles in their native Denmark.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2003–2007: Formation and early career ===\nAlphabeat is made up of six members: lead vocalists Anders Stig Gehrt \"Anders SG\" Nielsen and Stine Bramsen alongside Anders \"Anders B\" Bønløkke, Rasmus Nagel, Anders Reinholdt and Troels Møller.\nThe group first formed in 2003 under the name Sodastar, in the Danish town of Silkeborg. As Sodastar, they won the 2004 edition of Danish music contest LiveContest DK, which enabled the creation of a self-titled EP and 16-date promotional tour. In 2006, the group changed their name to Alphabeat, to avoid confusion with a German band.\n\n\n=== 2007–2009: Alphabeat ===\nThe band's eponymous debut album, Alphabeat, was released in Denmark on 5 March 2007, peaking at number two on the Danish Albums Chart and reaching platinum status in five months of release. It was preceded by the singles \"Fascination\" in June 2006 and \"10.000 Nights of Thunder\" in January 2007. The former peaked at number 4 in Denmark, while the latter was a number 1 hit. \nThe band's success in their domestic market attracted the attention of several major labels from larger markets abroad and Alphabeat was eventually signed to EMI's Charisma Records label in the United Kingdom. Their debut UK single, \"Fantastic 6\", was released on 26 November 2007, followed by the international release of Alphabeat the following year, retitled This Is Alphabeat and featuring a revised track listing. It peaked at number ten on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry on 10 October 2008. \"Fascination\" was released in the UK in May 2008, peaked at number 6, and was certified Gold. This was followed by the UK release of \"10.000 Nights of Thunder\" (retitled \"10,000 Nights\"), which peaked at number 16. Later single releases from the album included \"Boyfriend\" (DEN #11, UK #15), \"Go-Go\" (DEN #14), and \"What is Happening\". On 19 January 2009, Alphabeat announced that they had parted ways with their UK label Charisma Records.\n\n\n=== 2009–2013: The Spell and Express Non-Stop ===\nIt was announced on 7 March 2009 that Alphabeat had signed a new record deal with Polydor Records. The band's manager said, \"We are thrilled to be signing to one of the UK's most successful record companies, and looking forward to achieving even more success with the band and Polydor in the coming years.\" That year, Alphabeat won an EBBA Award.\nIn August 2009, Popjustice premiered their single \"The Spell\", which was released on 21 September 2009. The song was a number one hit in Denmark and peaked at number 20 in the UK. On 26 October 2009, their second studio album The Spell was released in Denmark, where it charted at number five and was certified gold in less than two months of release. The UK release of the album was originally set for November 2009, but it was subsequently pushed back until 1 March 2010 and the album's title was changed to The Beat Is... It debuted and peaked at number thirty-nine on the UK Albums Chart.\nOn 9 January 2010 \"DJ\" was released as the second single in the Danish market where it peaked at number 6. The second UK single, \"Hole in My Heart\", was released on 22 February 2010 and debuted and peaked at number twenty-nine on the UK Singles Chart. In May 2010, \"DJ\" was released as the third single from the album in the UK, retitled \"DJ (I Could Be Dancing)\"; its single version was remixed by Biffco. The song peaked at number 116 on the UK Singles Chart. In June 2010, \"Heat Wave\" was released as the third single from the album in Denmark (but fourth overall), and peaked at number 4.\nAlphabeat's third studio album, Express Non-Stop, was released on 24 September 2012. The album's first single, \"Vacation\", was released as a digital download in the UK on 12 March 2012. A second single, \"Love Sea\", was released on iTunes on 13 August 2012. Two more singles, \"X-Mas (Let's Do It Again)\" and \"Show Me What Love Is\" were released from the album before the band went on hiatus to focus on side projects in 2013.\n\n\n=== 2013–2019: Hiatus and solo projects ===\n\nOn 18 September 2013, after a series of gigs supporting Express Non-Stop, Alphabeat posted that they were \"over and out\" on their social media feeds, suggesting the band were taking hiatus.\nOn 23 September, it was confirmed that lead vocalist Stine Bramsen had signed a recording contract to produce her own solo album. The album, Fiftyseven, was released on 9 October 2015 and reached number 1 on the Danish charts. It was proceeded in 2015 by a self-titled EP and succeeded in 2018 by a second EP, Bruised.\nIn July 2014, vocalist Anders SG and guitarist Anders Bønløkke formed production duo THANKS, releasing the single \"Comeback Girl.\" The duo returned in 2016 with new track \"Dizzy\" and continued to release music until 2018, with the release of the album Mind Expansion.\nOn 1 June 2018, Alphabeat released a 10th Anniversary edition of This is Alphabeat exclusively on vinyl. The record featured an adjusted tracklisting, using the original recording of \"Nothing But My Baby\" and including \"Into the Jungle\" and \"Ocean Blue\", both also from the album's original release.\n\n\n=== 2019–2021: Don't Know What's Cool Anymore and second split ===\nFollowing a six-year hiatus, Alphabeat signed a new recording deal with Atlantic Records and released a new song, \"Shadows\", in March 2019. The band made a series of performance events in the United States, led by a Neon Gold Records showcase at the SXSW event on 13 March 2019, as well as a tour of their native Denmark, as part of Grøn Koncert during July 2019. On 30 August 2019, Alphabeat released the single \"I Don't Know What's Cool Anymore\". \nThe band held a 10-date tour of Denmark throughout February 2020, which was followed by an additional three dates in the United Kingdom in April 2020. On 23 September 2019, \"Shadows\" was nominated for 'Radio Hit of the Year' at the 2019 Danish Music Awards. A day later, the music video for \"I Don't Know What's Cool Anymore\" was released, directed by band members Rasmus Nagel and Anders Reinholdt.\nOn 1 November 2019, the band released their fourth studio album Don't Know What's Cool Anymore. On 16 November 2019, the band released a music video for the album track \"Sing a Song\". The following day, Danish television channel DR3 premiered a documentary series focusing on Alpahabeat. Titled Alphabeat - Da Festen Forsvandt (English: Alphabeat - When the Party Disappeared), the 4-part series explores the group's relationships and troubles surrounding the release of their 2012 album and 2013 hiatus. On 15 May 2020 it was announced that \"Shadows\" had been nominated for the \"Most Played Song of the Year\" at the Carl Prisen Awards.

The track marks the band's first release in Danish and is a collaboration with members of the Denmark national football team. An accompanying music video for the song premiered on June 9.\nOn 24 September 2021, the group played Fredagsrock, the Friday-night concert event at Copenhagen amusement park Tivoli. A day later, the group confirmed via social media that this was \"the final outdoor Alphabeat show ever\". On 16 October they played their last gig, part of a 9-date tour of Denmark previously billed as their \"last tour... for now.\" On 9 December 2021, the band shared a behind-the-scenes video of their final show to their Facebook account. Alongside this, they shared the reasoning behind their second split, explaining that whilst they had \"no plans on writing new songs or to go on tour again\", they did not rule out a future return.\nFollowing these shows, lead singer Stine Bramsen returned to her solo work, starting with the comeback single \"What I Want You to Do\" on 24 September 2021. A year later, in September 2022, Anders SG also began a solo career, releasing the debut single \"Noget for nogen\".\n\n\n== Touring ==\nAlphabeat made their UK debut at Monto Water Rats in May 2007 and later that year embarked on their first UK tour (The Wolfbaggin' tour), supporting Lil Chris and Daniel Powter. They were offered the chance to open for the Spice Girls during their 2007–08 Return of the Spice Girls tour, but declined the opportunity, feeling that it would be \"too weird\" to suddenly play in front of a 23,000 audience unfamiliar with the band's music.\nThey have often been associated with the wonky pop movement—their manager owns the brand name—and they have played a number of Wonky Pop events and tours.\nDuring the summer of 2008 they played numerous British and international festivals including T in the Park on \"Camper's Friday\", Roskilde Festival, T4 on the Beach, Summerfestival (in Klaksvík, Faroe Islands, in early August), and in October 2008, along with many other bands at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, England for hundreds of young girlguides.\nDuring late 2008, Alphabeat began a twenty-two-gig tour in the UK and the Netherlands, with many shows sold out. In the same year, the band was planning to play select shows with American singer Katy Perry on her 2008 world tour. However, in March 2009, Alphabeat cancelled their appearances in support of her US tour. Their management stated that they were instead working on their second album and planned to tour the US later in the year.\nThey performed a mini UK tour to promote The Spell in autumn 2009 and toured the UK throughout April 2010, on The Beat Is... Tour. They also played a support slot for Lady Gaga on the UK and Irish leg of her The Monster Ball Tour, which took place in February and March 2010. They made their US debut at the 2010 SXSW Festival. In June 2010, they co-headlined with Wheatus at Trinity May Ball, in Cambridge, UK.\nOn 26 July 2011, Alphabeat were the midline act at the pre-event party for the UK contingent of 4000 scouts, the night before leaving for the 22nd World Scout Jamboree in Sweden.

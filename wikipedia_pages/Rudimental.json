In regard to the name \"Rudimental\", Kesi Dryden said, \"When I was a kid I used to go to piano lessons. There was a book called the Book of Rudiments, and my teacher would always have a go at me for forgetting it. I always used to hear 'rudiments, rudiments, where's your rudiments?' When I was a teenager, I was looking for a producer name for myself, and I would call myself 'Rudiments'. And when we started collaborating and sharing music together, Rudimental sort of felt better for a band name.\"\nTheir first release, \"Sexy Sexy\", with vocal contribution by Natalie May was released in 2009 along with a music video and became a regular fixture in every club DJ set and was featured on a number of big selling dance and urban compilations. 2010 saw a second song release called \"Club Love\", and a remix of Natalie May's \"Closer\".

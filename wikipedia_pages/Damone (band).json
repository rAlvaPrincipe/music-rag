The band originated in Waltham, a city located just west of Boston, Massachusetts and consisted of Noelle LeBlanc (vocals/guitar), Mike Woods (guitar), Michael Vazquez (bass guitar) and Dustin Hengst (drums).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed by Adam Rourke and then-teenage singer/guitarist Noelle LeBlanc. The band was originally known as Noelle, and released an album called This Summer under that name, which was later re-recorded as From the Attic.\nDamone released their first album, From the Attic, on RCA in 2003. Original lead guitarist Dave Pino left the band some time in 2004, being replaced by Mike Woods from Boston.\nWhile working on new material, the band was dropped from its label after requesting to be released. They were quickly picked up by Island Def-Jam Records.\nDamone released their second LP, Out Here All Night, on iTunes in early 2006, with the CD version released on May 23, 2006. There was heavy rotation of the song \"Out Here All Night\", and the band toured extensively throughout the Americas, Canada, Asia & Europe.\nDamone released their third album, Roll the Dice, in 2008. They then toured the UK as support to the Wildhearts.\nThe band's song \"Revolution\" is the official anthem for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer.\nIn 2012 Candlebox covered \"Out Here All Night\" on their album Love Stories & Other Musings.\nOn December 8, 2011, the band's drummer, Dustin Hengst, died at the age of 39 from liver and kidney failure.\nIn April 2019, Damone announced they would reunite for two shows in Boston that July.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nThis Summer (2002) (as Noelle)\nFrom the Attic (2003)\nOut Here All Night (2006) #168 Billboard 200\nRoll the Dice (2008)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Frustrated Unnoticed\" (2002) (as Noelle)\n\"Frustrated Unnoticed\" (re-release) (2003)\n\"Out Here All Night\" (2006) #32 Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks\n\"Everybody Wants You\" (2006)\n\"Roll the Dice\" (2008)\n\n\n== Band members ==\nNoelle LeBlanc  (lead vocals, guitar)\nMike Woods (lead guitars, vocals)\nVazquez (bass guitar, vocals)\nLuke Mangini (drums)\nMike Scrima (keys)\n\n\n== Previous members ==\nDave Pino (guitar)\nAdam Rourke (drummer/engineer/producer)\nBryce Martin (guitar)\nDustin Hengst (drums; died 2011)\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Nearly Practically Almost Famous\".

    "text": "James McClellan Boal (c. 1811–1862) was an American artist, trader, and politician who served in the Minnesota Territorial Council and House of Representatives from 1849 until 1853.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBoal was born c. 1811 in Pennsylvania. He enlisted as a drummer and went to Fort Snelling. He was bunkmates with Joseph R. Brown, a fifer. He then traveled to St. Paul and established himself as a house and sign painter. He was elected as one of the first Councillors of the territory by a vote of 98 to 91. His fellow Whig partisans were apparently so happy he had won that they paraded him through the streets of the city with a chariot made from an oxcart. He served as a Councillor from 1849 until 1852 and then served as a Representative from then until early January of 1853. He was also appointed as the territorial adjutant general by Governor Alexander Ramsey from 1849 until 1853.\nBoal would go on to become a founding member of the Republican Party of Minnesota in 1855. He had received a letter from the Republican Territorial Committee saying that Boal \"[held] the principles of the Republican Party, and [could] be relied upon as a Leading Man in [his] vicinity, to be active in forwarding the organization of the Republican movement in this Territory.\"\nBoal moved to Mendota from Saint Paul sometime before his death in 1862. A street in Saint Paul is named after him, though it uses the erroneous spelling of his last name, McBoal.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at Minnesota Legislature"

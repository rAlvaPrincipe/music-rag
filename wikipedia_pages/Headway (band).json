    "text": "Headway was a five piece British Britpop revival band from Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. In early 2003, childhood friends singer/guitarist, David Wright, and guitarist, Joe Watts, recruited two more members. These were Dave Astbury on bass and Johnny Dakers on drums (later replaced by David Wright's brother Jay). The keyboardist Tom Harrison was added and Headway had fully formed.\nThey gained a following within the English club scene, and struck a recording contract with the newly founded Suretone Records after Jordan Schur, the label's president, saw one of their concerts. Their song \"Lord Knows\" appeared on the US television program, ER.\nHeadway toured with OneRepublic during the UK leg of their tour.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nTrue, Chris \"Headway Biography\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation\n\"'Headway' makes the headline\", BBC, 4 March 2004\n\"Making slow Headway\", BBC, 7 February 2005\nHeadway at Suretone Records"

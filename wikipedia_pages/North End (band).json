    "text": "North End was an American boogie and club music-influenced garage house music group, consisted of Arthur Baker, Russell Presto and Tony Carbone.\nNorth End debuted in 1979 with an uptempo disco track titled \"Kind of Life (Kind of Love)\" which was released by West End Records. Two years later, \"Happy Days\" was released on Emergency Records and peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Club Play Singles chart. Madonna's \"Holiday\" was loosely based on \"Happy Days\".\nAlthough the band didn't technically exist in 1982, all their members continued to arrange and produce Michelle Wallace's material, including \"Jazzy Rhythm\" and \"It's Right\", both written by Baker, Presto and Carbone.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNorth End discography at Discogs"

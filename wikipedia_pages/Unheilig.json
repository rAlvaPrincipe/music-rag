    "text": "Unheilig [ˈʊnhaɪ̯lɪç] (German for \"Unholy\") is a German band that draws from a variety of influences, including various pop and electronic styles as well as heavier, nihilistic hard rock. The band was founded in Aachen in 1999 and principally consisted of singer Bernd Heinrich \"Der Graf\" (the Count) along with various musical partners. He was accompanied for live shows with musicians Christoph \"Licky\" Termühlen, Henning Verlage, and Martin \"Potti\" Potthoff. The group's debut, Phosphor, came out in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1999–2009) ===\n\nBernd Heinrich Graf (a.k.a. \"Der Graf\", \"The Count\") founded Unheilig in 1999 with Grant Stevens (writer of  \"Everlasting Friends\", a song featured in a German television commercial for Holsten Pilsener beer) and José Alvarez-Brill (Wolfsheim, Joachim Witt, De/Vision).\nTheir first single \"Sage Ja!\" (Say Yes!) was released on Bloodline Records in 1999. It entered the Deutsche Alternative Charts and became popular in night clubs. In February 2001 Unheilig's debut album \"Phosphor\" was published in Europe.\nOver the next few months, the band guested at major festivals and open-air events in Germany (Zillo Open Air, Wave-Gotik-Treffen Leipzig, Doomsday Festival, Woodstage Festival) before taking a break from live work to write and produce the Christmas album Frohes Fest (Merry Christmas) released in 2002 and the third album Das 2. Gebot (The 2nd Commandment).\nIn February 2003, the band toured eleven European cities as support to L'Âme Immortelle, and played songs from the album Das 2. Gebot.\nDirectly after the tour, the EP Schutzengel (Guardian Angel) was released, including four previously unreleased tracks. The band played in festivals during the summer. The M'era Luna Festival was one of the highlights for the band and the fans. Der Graf produced remixes for Absurd Minds, Terminal Choice and other bands and produced a song for the Xbox game Project Gotham Racing 2. Then the band started recording the album \"Zelluloid\".\nZelluloid was released on 23 February 2004, and at the same time, the band toured with Terminal Choice. A fan vote organised by Unheilig chose the tracks for the EP Freiheit, released 18 October 2004.\nUnheilig played more concerts in 2004 than any previous year. A live album Gastspiel was released on 31 January 2005.\nSix weeks before release of their DVD \"Kopfkino\" A mainstream music television channel (VIVA Plus) broadcast an Unheilig song video for the first time – the video of \"Freiheit\".\nThe album \"Moderne Zeiten\" (Modern Times) was released on 20 January 2006. The theme of the album is dreams.\nDuring 2007 the band played a small number of festivals including Wacken Open Air, Amphi festival and Burgrock Altena festival.\nIn 2008, Unheilig released the album \"Puppenspiel\".

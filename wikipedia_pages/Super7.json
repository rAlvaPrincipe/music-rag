    "text": "Super7, also known as S7, was a child boy band from Jakarta, Indonesia, who formed in March 2011. Their most famous single, \"BFF (Sahabat)\", was released in 2011. They released two studio albums before breaking up in 2015. Some members of the band then formed the new ensemble New Super7. Their fans were known as \"Seveners\".\n\n\n== History ==\nSuper7 formed in 2011 and were signed to Keci Music in August 2011. The band members, who were all child actors, met on set and formed a band, which they named Super7 because there were originally seven of them (Ajil, Bagas, Jose, Bryant, James, Raza, and Karel) and each one had a unique talent. James withdrew early in the band's career in order to focus on school, and was replaced by Bryan Domani. Super7 released their debut album The Adventure of Super7 in 2012, and it was sold primarily in KFC restaurants in Indonesia. The album won the Best Children's Album award at the 16th annual Anugerah Musik Indonesia award ceremony in 2013.\nIn 2013, the band were cast in Bersama Meraih Mimpi, a musical comedy drama television series. The eponymous soundtrack, Super7's second studio album, was released the same year. In December 2013, Super7 published a special fan book also titled Bersama Meraih Mimpi, documenting the band's journey through the Indonesian music industry.\nThe group's structure fluctuated around this time, with various temporary members coming and going. On 17 March 2014, Bryant Santoso officially left the band. Two months later, on 3 May 2014, Bryan Domani and Raza Adhanzio also left. Karel Susanteo followed suit on 12 October of the same year. In late 2014, the band's contract with Keci Music came to an end.\nIn early 2015, the three remaining members of the band (Jose, Ajil, and Bagas) were cast in the soap opera Bidadari Takut Jatuh Cinta. Around this time, Bagas and Jose were planning to release a new single as a duo, but Super7 officially broke up shortly after. The group later reformed as New Super7, with a fresh lineup consisting of Jose Christian, Bagas Dwi Rizqi Hidayat, and Andreas Utomo.\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\nSuka Suka Super Seven Dan Idola Cilik Dalam Habis Gelap Menuju Terang is a feature film starring Super7, Tissa Biani, Mike Lewis, and Denada.

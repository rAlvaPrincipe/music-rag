    "text": "Love Sculpture were a Welsh blues rock band that was active from 1966 to 1970, led by Dave Edmunds (born 15 April 1944 in Cardiff, Wales), with bassist John David (born 19 January 1946 in Cardiff) and drummer Rob \"Congo\" Jones (born 13 August 1946 in Barry, Wales).\n\n\n== Career ==\nLove Sculpture were founded in Cardiff in 1966 by former members of the Human Beans. The band mostly performed blues standards, slightly revved-up, but still close to the originals. Their debut album Blues Helping included the songs \"Summertime\" and \"Wang Dang Doodle\".\nThey are best known for their 1968 novelty hit in the UK Singles Chart, a high-speed cover version of the classical piece \"Sabre Dance\" by Aram Khachaturian, released on the Parlophone label (R 5744), which reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1968. The recording was inspired by Keith Emerson's classical rearrangements. \"Sabre Dance\" became a hit after receiving air play by British DJ John Peel, who was so impressed that he played it twice in one programme. In December 1968, UK music magazine NME reported that Love Sculpture had signed a US recording contract with London Records, guaranteeing £250,000. The band were also given an invitation to perform \"Sabre Dance\" live on the German Beat-Club television programme of Radio Bremen, being broadcast in monochrome at that time.\nSecond album Forms and Feelings followed, including the aforementioned \"Sabre Dance\", and additional songs including , \"In The Land of the Few\", \"Farandole\", \"People People\", \"Seagull (West Coast Oil Tragedy)\", written by Paul Korda, and the equally fast cover of Chuck Berry's \"You Can't Catch Me\". The US version of the album also featured a recording of \"Mars\" from Gustav Holst's The Planets, but Holst's estate refused to license the tune for the UK version.\nThey recorded for BBC Radio 1's John Peel sessions in 1968 (twice) and 1969.\nIn 1970 Mickey Gee joined the band as a second guitarist, and Terry Williams replaced Rob Jones on drums.\nLove Sculpture split up in 1970 after a US tour, having recorded just the two albums. Edmunds went on to solo number one hit success with \"I Hear You Knocking\" later in 1970, and collaborated heavily with ex-Brinsley Schwarz bassist Nick Lowe, eventually forming the band Rockpile with him and Terry Williams.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nDave Edmunds – lead vocals, guitar (1966–70)\nJohn David – bass, backing vocals (1966–70)\nRob \"Congo\" Jones – drums, percussion (1966–1970)\nMickey Gee – guitar (1970)\nTerry Williams – drums, percussion (1970)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Blues Helping – (October 1968) – Parlophone ====\nReleased in the US in mid-May on Motown's new Rare Earth label (RS-505), with a different cover design.\n\n\"The Stumble\" (Freddy King, Sonny Thompson) (shown as \"Stumble\" on cover, \"The Stumble\" on label)\n\"3 O'Clock Blues\" (B.

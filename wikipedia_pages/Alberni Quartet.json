It was initially named the Simons Quartet, after its first violinist, and later renamed Alberni (the name of Dennis Simons' birthplace in Canada). From 1968 Davis became the 1st violinist, with Peter Pople, Roger Best, and David Smith. They were based in Harlow, Essex where they became established in the 1960s as the town's \"quartet in residence\", and by the mid-1970s had become world-renowned.  Their debut in the Carnegie Hall was well received in the New York Times, and they received positive reviews of their recordings of Schumann's piano quintet, Schubert's string quintet and Brahms' string sextets numbers one and two.\nAs well as performing a wide range of the classical string quartet repertoire from Haydn and Mozart to Bartók and Benjamin Britten, they performed new works written for them including Richard Stoker's first string quartet at the Buxton Festival in February 1962 and again at the SPNM, 4 St James's Square, London, in March 1963, Alan Rawsthorne's third string quartet written for the 1965 Harlow Music Festival, and Nicholas Maw's first string quartet.\nBenjamin Britten coached them in his own first and second string quartets (they have recorded all three of his works in the genre), and entrusted the first British performances of Dmitri Shostakovich's ninth and tenth quartets (whose scores he had acquired from the composer) to them.\nThe Alberni were the first Western quartet to visit China (1987).\nThey were the resident quartet at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama from 1981 to 1988.\nIn 1993, at the Presteigne Festival, the quartet gave the first complete performance of Adrian Williams' Third String Quartet.\nThe Alberni Quartet are now based in South-West England, and have been Quartet-in-Residence at Cedars Hall, Wells, and Artists-in-Residence at the 2018 Two Moors Festival.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nWhite, John (1997).

On March 1, 2010, they disbanded.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFlame debuted in 2001 with their single \"Mune no Kodō.\" Prior to debut, all four members had participated in the Junon Super Boy Contest. The group steadily released singles until their first album was released in late 2002 after four singles. A fifth single followed that in March 2003, but it was a different image and sound for the boy band. After their sixth single, \"Venus\", their releases became sporadic. In 2004, Kaneko left Flame to pursue a solo career. Seigo Noguchi was announced as a new member during Flame's fan club meeting on December 24, 2004, along with \"Shake You Down\" releasing as a new single on February 16, 2005. \"Shake You Down\" was used as the ending theme songs to Shōnen Champloo and Saruche.

    "text": "Concerto Amsterdam was a classical chamber ensemble based in the Netherlands and active during the 1960s and 1970s in both live performance and the recording studio. It was founded in 1960 by the Dutch violinist Jaap Schröder with most of its members drawn from Amsterdam's Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. In addition to Schröder who served as the ensemble's concert master until 1973, its soloists have included keyboardist Gustav Leonhardt, violist Joke Vermeulen, flautist Frans Brüggen, and cellist Anner Bylsma.   \nConcerto Amsterdam's musicians originally played on modern instruments using \"historically informed\" performance techniques. However, in the late 1960s the ensemble transitioned to performing on \"period\" instruments. The mainstay of their repertoire was music from the Baroque and early Classical periods, but they also made the first complete recording of Die 7 Kammermusiken by the 20th-century composer Paul Hindemith. The ensemble received the Edison Award in 1977. Many of their original vinyl recordings for Telefunken have since been reissued on CD by Teldec in Das Alte  Werke series.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nConcerto Amsterdam's recordings include:\n\nTelemann: Tafelmusik (1964).

    "text": "Gothic Voices is a United Kingdom-based vocal ensemble specialising in the performance of music of the Medieval era. The group was originally formed in 1980 by the scholar and musician Christopher Page.\n\n\n== Repertoire ==\nThe choir's repertoire is mostly music from the 11th to the 15th century, encompassing works by composers such as Guillaume de Machaut, Guillaume Du Fay and Hildegard of Bingen, and other music from the European Medieval and early Renaissance eras. As well as performing medieval repertoire, the group sings contemporary music, particularly pieces with medieval associations, and commissions new works from composers such as Joanne Metcalf and Andrew Smith.\nThe distinctive sound of the Gothic Voices is attributable to Christopher Page's musicological research into Medieval performance practice, from which he concluded that the lines of musical accompaniment in Medieval scores were intended to be sung by lower voice parts, rather than played by instruments. Page presented his findings in 1981 in broadcasts on BBC Radio 3 prior to the release of the Gothic Voices' first recording later that year. Their performance style has been influential on a number of noted early music vocal groups such as Sequentia.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nFollowing the retirement of Leigh Nixon in September 2014, the current singers in Gothic Voices are Catherine King (mezzo-soprano), Steven Harrold (tenor), Julian Podger (tenor)  and Stephen Charlesworth (baritone), a line-up which has been consistent since 1995.  Other notable singers who have performed and recorded with Gothic Voices include Emma Kirkby, Emily Van Evera, Margaret Philpot, Evelyn Tubb, Howard Milner, Charles Daniels, Rogers Covey-Crump, James Gilchrist, Paul Agnew, John Mark Ainsley and Peter Harvey.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nGothic Voices have recorded 23 albums for the Hyperion, Avie and Linn record labels, three of which have won the Gramophone Award given by Gramophone magazine.  The group's first disc, A Feather on the Breath of God – Hymns and Sequences by Abbess Hildegard of Bingen was one of Hyperion's biggest commercial successes and remains one of the best-selling recordings of pre-classical music ever made. The album was selected in 2020 by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nAmong Gothic Voices' more recent recordings are a disc of the complete works of the relatively obscure 14th-century composer Solage coupled with works by Machaut and a disc entitled A Laurel for Landini - 14th Century Italy’s Greatest Composer, with music by Francesco Landini. Their 2023 album, The Splendour of Florence, features music of early Renaissance Italy, including a motet written by Dufay for the consecration of Florence's new cathedral in 1436.\n\n1981 - A Feather on the Breath of God - Sequences and Hymns by Abbess Hildegard of Bingen Originally released by Hyperion on Vinyl LP A66039 1982 and re-released April 1985 on Hyperion CDA66039\n1983 - The Mirror of Narcissus - Songs by Guillaume de Machaut Released Sep 1987 on Hyperion CDA66087\n1984 - The Garden of Zephirus - Courtly songs of the early fifteenth century Re-released June 2007 on Helios CDH55289 (orig.

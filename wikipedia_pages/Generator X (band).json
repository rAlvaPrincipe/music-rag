    "text": "Generator X (established 1998 in Oslo) is a Norwegian Jazz band initiated by Audun Kleive. Most of the tracks for their first album were conceived live, during the band’s first sessions together, retaining the spontaneity of the genre. Framework is a metal/electronica composition, energetic and alarmingly intense. Mainstay or Obelisk are more contained, evolving slowly, following the strolls of the musicians, obviously at ease with each other, holding the convulsions, slowing down the pace, changing tempo, almost grounding the machinery to a complete halt at a few occasions, avoiding a premature climax. The symbiosis is perfect, almost palpable.\nOhmagoddabl (2003) are mixed in Bill Laswell's Turteltone Studios, New York.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\nChristian Wallumrød – keyboards\nOle Morten Vågan – bass guitar\nAudun Kleive – Drums\nFormer members\nJan Bang – samples\nGeir Østensjø – Sound Design\nStåle Storløkken – synthesizer\nArve Henriksen – trumpet\n\n\n== Discography ==\n2000: Generator X (Jazzland Recordings)\n2004: Ohmagoddabl (Jazzland Recordings)\n2012: Attack (POL-selection)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAudun Kleive Official Website"

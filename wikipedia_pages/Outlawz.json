    "text": "Outlawz is an American hip hop group founded by Tupac Shakur and Yafeu Fula in 1995. Originally known as Thoro Headz and Young Thugs back then, the group attracted attention with their appearance on Tupac's song \"Flex,\" which was the B-side of his single \"Holler If Ya Hear Me,\" released on February 4, 1993. \nIn late 1993, Mutah \"Napoleon\" Beale joined the group, which then adopted the name Dramacydal. The group later appeared on the tracks \"Me Against the World\" and \"Outlaw\" from Shakur's album Me Against the World, released on March 14, 1995.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was introduced as the Outlaw Immortalz in February 1996. The members included Shakur, who used the alias \"Makaveli,\" Hussein Fatal and Yaki Kadafi, known as Fatal-N-Felony, Thug Life members   Big Syke and Mopreme Shakur, were also included. Who went by the aliases \"Mussolini\" and \"Komani,\" respectively and Dramacydal additionally, Big Malc, K-Dog, and Lil' Mu used the aliases E.D.I. Mean, Kastro, and Napoleon. They were first featured on the song \"When We Ride\" from Shakur's fourth studio album, All Eyez on Me. Storm, introduced on All Eyez on Me as the only female member, became the ninth member of the group and began working on her solo album under Tupac's management.\nIn June 1996, Hussein, Kadafi, and E.D.I. were featured on Shakur's Death Row Greatest Hits diss track \"Hit 'Em Up,\" now credited as \"The Outlawz.\" Although Kastro and Napoleon were not featured on the track, they appeared in the music video.\nDuring the recording of All Eyez on Me and \"Hit 'Em Up,\" Kadafi introduced his friend Rufus Cooper III to 2Pac. Cooper, who later became known as Young Noble, joined the group and was featured on Makaveli's album The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nRufus Cooper III, alias: Young Noble\nMalcolm Greenridge, alias: E.D.I.

Fatal was subsequently removed from the group's first album, Still I Rise. In 2010, Fatal rejoined the group to record the album Perfect Timing which saw its release in 2011.

The following year he was posthumously credited as a featured artist on the Outlawz song \"So Much Pain\".\nKatari Terrance Cox, alias: Kastro, Shakur's cousin and named after Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, left the group in 2009, citing differences in the group's direction post-Shakur's passing and to also pursue a solo career.\nMutah Wassin Shabazz Beale, alias: Napoleon, childhood friend of Kadafi and named after French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, left the music industry and became a motivational speaker after converting to Islam in 2001.\nTyruss Gerald \"Big Syke\" Himes, alias: Mussolini, member of Shakur's previous group Thug Life and named after Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, died of natural causes in 2016 at age 48.

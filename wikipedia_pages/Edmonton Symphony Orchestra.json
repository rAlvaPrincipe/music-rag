    "text": "The Edmonton Symphony Orchestra (ESO) is a Canadian orchestra based in Edmonton, Alberta. As the professional orchestra of Alberta's creative capital city it presents over 85 concerts a year of symphonic music in all genres, from classical to country. Currently in its 72nd season, the orchestra is composed of 56 core professional musicians who perform 42 weeks per season and who play an active role in the musical life of Edmonton and elsewhere as performers, teachers and recording artists. The ESO also performs as the orchestra for Edmonton Opera and Alberta Ballet productions, and its recordings are regularly heard across Canada on CBC Radio 2.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Edmonton Symphony Orchestra was initially formed as Edmonton's community orchestra and performed its first concert on November 15, 1920. The orchestra suspended operations in 1932 due to lack of funds, but was revived on October 31, 1952, when it was incorporated as a registered not-for-profit organization (the Edmonton Symphony Society), and gave its first performance on November 30, 1952. It made the transition to a fully professional orchestra in September 1971. In 1973, it was decided to restrict the orchestra to \"classical\" size.\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ESO's budget was over $10 million, and its players were the highest-paid Canadian orchestral musicians west of Toronto.\n\n\n== Music directors, conductors, concertmasters, and artistic leaders ==\n\n\n=== Music and artistic directors ===\nAlexander Prior 2017-2022 (Chief Conductor)\nWilliam Eddins 2005-2017 (named Music Director Emeritus in 2017)\nGrzegorz Nowak 1994-2002\nUri Mayer 1981-1994 (named Conductor Laureate in 1994)\nPierre Hétu 1973-1979, 1979-1980 (Principal Guest Conductor)\nLawrence Leonard 1968-1973\nBrian Priestman 1964-1968\nLee Hepner 1952-1960\n\n\n=== Conductors ===\nMichael Stern 2022-2024 (Artistic Advisor)\nCosette Justo Valdés 2019-2021 (Assistant Conductor), 2021- (Resident Conductor)\nLucas Waldin 2009-2012 (Resident Conductor)\nPetar Dundjerski 2006-2008 (Assistant Conductor in Residence)\nKazuyoshi Akiyama 2004-2005 (Principal Guest Conductor)\nFranz-Paul Decker 2003-2004 (Principal Guest Conductor)\nDavid Hoyt 1987-2002 (Resident Guest Conductor, Resident Conductor), 2002-2003 (artistic director)\nPeter Nero 1984-1985 (Pops Music Director)\nDaniel Swift 1983-1984 (Assistant Conductor)\nYuval Zaliouk 1980-1981 (Interim Chief Conductor)\nMitch Miller 1979-1982 (Principal Guest Conductor for Pops)\nPeter McCoppin 1978-1980 (Assistant Conductor)\nJohn Barnum 1973-1977 (Assistant Conductor)\nEdward (Ted) Kardash 1971-1973 (Assistant Conductor)\nTom Rolston 1960-1964 (Associate Conductor)\n\n\n=== Concertmasters ===\nRobert Uchida 2013–present\nEric Buchmann (interim) 2010-2013\nMartin Riseley 1994-2010\nEric Buchmann, Richard Caldwell, Virginie Gagné, Broderyk Olson (interim, in rotation) 2009-2010\nJohn Lowry 2002-2003 (interim)\nJames Keene 1972-1994\nCharles (Karol) Dobiáš 1970-1972\nMarguerite Marzantowicz 1960-1964 (interim), 1964–1970\nTom Rolston 1958-1964\nWalter Holowach 1957-1958 (interim)\nAlexander Nicol 1952-1957\n\n\n== Performing venue ==\n\nIn September 1997, the Edmonton Symphony Society and the Edmonton Concert Hall Foundation successfully completed a two-decade, $45 million capital campaign, and the ESO moved from the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium (the orchestra's principal performing venue since 1957) into its new concert hall, the acoustically superb, 1716 seat Francis Winspear Centre for Music. The inaugural gala, at which the ESO performed Mahler's Symphony of a Thousand with the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, took place on September 13, 1997.\n\n\n== Programming and special events ==\nEach season, almost 30,000 students experience the orchestra's music at the Winspear Centre. The Young Composers Project, with local composers as mentors, allows select high school students to compose orchestral works and hear them in performance. The orchestra's annual outdoor Symphony Under the Sky Festival is a popular destination for Edmontonians on Labour Day weekend.\nThe ESO's history and the varied nature of its programming reflect its imaginative commitment to its community.\n\nIn 1972, the Procol Harum album Procol Harum Live: In Concert with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and its hit single \"Conquistador\" became the first orchestral recording to achieve international platinum sales.\nIn 1985, the ESO premiered Malcolm Forsyth's Atayoskewin at the opening of Shell Canada's Scotford Refinery.\nIn 1980, to celebrate Alberta's 75th anniversary, the orchestra toured the province.\nIn 1986, the ESO performed at Vancouver's Expo 86.\nIn 1992, a televised ESO performance with k.d. lang conducted by Tommy Banks received a Gemini Award for Best Television Variety Performance.\nIn 1994, the orchestra undertook a five-city tour (the \"Northern Lights Tour\") of northern Alberta, the Yukon and the Northwest Territories.\nIn 1996, the ESO became the first Canadian orchestra to play on a First Nations Reserve.\nOn May 8, 2012, the ESO made its Carnegie Hall debut, its first performance outside of Canada.\n\n\n=== Special concerts ===\nSpecial ESO concerts drawing sold-out houses have featured, among others, k.d. lang in 1985, Tom Cochrane and Red Rider in 1989, The Arrogant Worms in 2002, Corb Lund in 2005, Paul Brandt in 2006, Video Games Live in 2007, Nikki Yanofsky in 2008, reunion concerts with Procol Harum in 1992 and 2010, Ben Folds in 2012 and 2014, and Ian Tyson on the 100th anniversary of the Province of Alberta on September 1, 2005. In March 2011, the ESO presented a memorable concert devoted exclusively to the music of Frank Zappa, and in December 2005, the orchestra returned to the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium to present two sold-out Christmas concerts with Christian singer/pianist Michael W. Smith. The orchestra continues this tradition of working with musicians from a variety of musical genres. In December 2012, the orchestra performed two Christmas concerts with the Barenaked Ladies. In December 2017, the orchestra performed four Christmas concerts with Jann Arden.\n\n\n== Composers in residence ==\nJohn McPherson was appointed the orchestra's fourth Composer in Residence in August 2016.\nRobert Rival, the orchestra's third Composer in Residence (2011-2014) wrote six major works for the orchestra during his residency:\n\nDelights & Discords (2014)\nNorthwest Passage Variations (2014)\nSymphony No. 2 \"Water\" (2013)\nAchilles and Scamander (2012)\nLullaby (2012)\nWhirlwind (2012)\n\nAllan Gilliland, the ESO's second Composer in Residence (2000–2004) composed nine major works for the orchestra, as well as a colorful new orchestration of Canada's national anthem. Before his residency, Gilliland had been commissioned to write two works for the ESO. Following his residency, he was commissioned to write two jazz-flavoured works: a rhapsody for piano and orchestra, and a suite for trumpet and orchestra.\n\nDreaming of the Masters III (2010) (funded by the Alberta Foundation for the Arts)\nDreaming of the Masters II (Rhapsody GEB) (2008) (co-commission with CBC)\nAbove the Fold (2004)\nCalixa Lavallée O Canada (new orchestration) (2004)\nDreaming of the Masters I (2003)\nGaol's Ruadh Ròs – A Celtic Concerto for Two Harps (2003)\nAlways Be True (2002)\nViolin Concerto (2002)\nA Wild Symphonic Ride (2002)\nLoch na Beiste (2001)\nOn the Shoulders of Giants (2001)\nShadows and Light (2000)\nWinspear Fanfare (1997)\nTrumpet Concerto (1994)\nJohn Estacio was the ESO's first Composer in Residence (1992–1999).

On April 29, 2005, the ESO presented a highly acclaimed concert of music by five contemporary Alberta composers – Allan Gordon Bell, John Estacio, Malcolm Forsyth, Allan Gilliland and Jeffrey McCune – in Southam Hall at Ottawa's National Arts Centre as part of the Alberta Scene festival.

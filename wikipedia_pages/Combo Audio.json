    "text": "Combo Audio was a new wave group from Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, best known for their song \"Romanticide.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nCombo Audio was formed as a vehicle for songs written by John Kellogg and collaborator Rick Neuhaus that evolved into a band. Several of their songs began to be played on local radio stations before their first gig. The group signed with local indie start up label Secret Records formed as a vehicle for Combo Audio music. Produced by Dana Walden and the group, \"Romanticide\" was produced and released as a single b/w \"It's a Crime\". \"Romanticide\" received \"Top Single Pick\" in Billboard as a result and received further airplay on college radio and major stations in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. Following creative differences original bassist Tom Broske was replaced by Angus Thomas. Ken Adamany who managed Cheap Trick showed interest and engaged to manage the group. The group signed with EMI America and produced an EP Combo Audio that was released in late 1983. Dana Walden began production of the EP with engineer Ian Taylor engineering and mixing with Paul Klingberg as second engineer. Eventually Walden was dropped from the project and the band and Ian Taylor finished the record at The Cars' Syncro Sound studios in Boston with Taylor producing and engineering. Several years of nearly non-stop touring in mostly the Midwest followed. The group played clubs and universities and other large venues. They co-billed with or shared stages with Talking Heads, U2, Billy Idol, Duran Duran, The Tubes, JoBoxers, Berlin, Missing Persons, Stray Cats and INXS.\nStarting in 1984, fissures began to appear. There was a disagreement between Secret Records and EMI over ownership of the group. Kellogg signed a publishing deal with Warner Chappell Music which led to more disagreements and disputes with Walden. In the middle of this to the dismay of the group EMI began to push the band to produce a more \"commercial\" pop sound. Legal complaints and threats of litigation appeared. While awaiting resolution of the disputes EMI cut support to the band. In 1985, after a company shakeup, EMI fired the group. In 1986, Kellogg and Thomas revamped a new version of the group with drummer David Suycott and other additional players. The group performed live in 1986 and 1987 with these additional players. Kellogg and Thomas continued to write and record independently with engineer, producer Paul Klingberg.\n\n\n== \"Romanticide\" ==\n\"Romanticide\" was released as a single for Secret Records in 1982 and as part of the Combo Audio EP. Two videos for the song were made. The first, made for the original 1982 single version, was only shown on the RockAmerica cable music subscription service. The second, made for the EP version, went into \"power rotation\" on MTV in early 1983 following its release. The song was the \"top single\" in Billboard and regular support and airplay followed in New York City, Boston, Chicago, St. Louis and Los Angeles. The song became available on the first volume of the compilation series, Living in Oblivion: The 80's Greatest Hits in 1993. NME describes the song as a \"new wave classic\".\n\n\n== Post-Combo Audio years ==\nJohn Kellogg has done extensive work with surround sound.

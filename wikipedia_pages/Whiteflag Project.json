    "text": "Whiteflag Project is a band of Jewish musicians from Israel and Arab musicians from the Gaza Strip. They are a one of a kind 'world fusion' band formed within the most conflicting areas of the Middle East – Israel and Palestine. Their songs are sung in the band members' native tongues of Arabic, Hebrew and English. Their collaboration as a band has endured many political difficulties as a result of the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWhiteflag Project official website\nTimesunion.com\nEnact.org.nz\nLast.fm\nWomex.com"

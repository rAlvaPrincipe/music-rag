    "text": "Psy・S [sáiz] (サイズ) (often written as \"Psy-S\" or \"Psy S\" in English due to the lack of the Japanese dot \"・\" on most Western keyboards) was a Japanese progressive pop/rock band, formed in 1983 by Masaya Matsuura alongside female vocal powerhouse Chaka (a pseudonym used by Mami Yasunori). After Japanese hits and successes throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, they disbanded in 1996.\nTheir musical style was an experimental mixture of electronic synthesizers, highly accomplished electric guitar riffs, and haunting, piercing vocals.\nThey were also known in Western regions for the opening theme and the soundtrack on the OVA adaption of To-Y from manga artist Atsushi Kamijo. Frontman Masaya Matsuura went on to provide several video games for PlayStation.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Masaya Matsuura 松浦雅也 ===\n(Born 16 June 1961) – from Osaka.\nThe leader of the band, both composer and arranger. Matsuura created Psy・S' music on a Fairlight CMI synthesizer, and also able to handle keyboard, guitar and bass.\nAfter the band's breakup, he moved into producing and creating music for video games via his own company, NanaOn-Sha, and is well known in both Japan and the west for his innovative approach to music-based gameplay. He created the well-received Sony PlayStation titles PaRappa the Rapper, UmJammer Lammy and Vib Ribbon, along with Vib Ripple for the PlayStation 2.\nIn 2004, Matsuura won the First Penguin Award at the Game Developers Choice Awards in San Jose. This was in recognition for his \"trailblazing work with beat-rhythm and music games.\"\n\n\n=== Chaka – Mami Yasunori 安則眞実 ===\n(Born 16 July 1960) – from Osaka.\nChaka was the vocalist and lyricist of the band. She began her career at age eighteen, working as a professional jazz singer in an Osaka jazz club, and joined Psy・S soon after. With Psy・S, her voice was intensely powerful and lent the band a vocal style instantly recognizable amongst the pop scene of 80s and 90s Japan.\nAfter the band's breakup, Chaka began her solo career, reverting to her jazz roots and releasing the albums Delicious Hip (1997), I Found Love (1999), Chaka Jazz (2002), and Love (2003). In 2004, she released an album titled Believin' ~Chaka Jazz in New York, in which she collaborated with famous faces from the jazz world such as Henry \"Hank\" Jones.\nChaka also recorded some anime songs like \"Hare tokidoki Buta\" (theme song, 1998); \"Card Captor Sakura – Ashita e no Melody\" (opening theme, 2000); \"Zenmai Zamurai\" (opening theme, 2006).\nToday, Chaka performs live jazz gigs in her native Japan and lend her voice to many famous Japanese artists. Among them, she recently participate in chorus for the Tsuyoshi Doumoto' solo unit \"Endlicheri Endlicheri\" (album \"Coward\", single \"The Rainbow Star\", all along \"The Rainbow Star\" Tour) and in the single \"Man & Woman\" from Chage & Aska.\n\n\n== History ==\nChaka (Mami Yasunori) met Masaya Matsuura in 1983, and two years later they released an independent album under the band name Playtechs. At this point they were merely an indies unit, and performed no live shows for the album. However, this became the basis of what would become Psy・S.\nPsy・S debuted in 1985 by releasing their first Psy・S album, Different View, with Sony Music. Their first single from the album, Teenage, went on simultaneous sale. This was their major debut, and a music video was created for Teenage.\nPsy・S' activity and popularity continued through the late 80s to mid 90s, where their music was used on TV shows (\"Mamatte kirei!?\" – 1991), anime (To-y – 1987, and City Hunter – 1988), and movies (Sweet Home – 1989).\nIn particular, Masaya Matsuura was given full musical supervision over the sound of the acclaimed anime adaptation of Atsushi Kamijo's manga To-y (an anime set-piece developed by a \"dream team\" of famous Japanese names in terms of directing, character design and art direction), creating a soundtrack which has garnered much praise in anime journalism. As the Anime News Network notes, \"No mention of TO-Y is complete without speaking of the music, which plays like a best-of album of Japan's progressive pop scene… For TO-Y, Psy・S' amazing opening and ending themes, Lemon no Yuuki and Cubic Lovers, are as essential to the show as the characters themselves.\"\nDuring their 1985–1996 history, Psy・S released eleven original albums, one live album, three \"best of\" collections, seven videos and a DVD. Finally, in the June 1996 issue of Japan's PC Music magazine, Masaya Matsuura officially announced the breakup (later referred to as the \"demise\") of Psy・S.\nIn 2002, a CD collection of their best singles, Golden Best (Singles+), was released, and a live DVD (the band's first) was released in 2005 containing footage from their 1988–1989 Non-Fiction Tour, when the band were at the height of their popularity.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nDifferent View (22 May 1985)\nPic-Nic (2 July 1986)\nCollection (26 February 1987)\nMint-Electric (1 August 1987)\nNon-Fiction (1 August 1988)\nAtlas (21 July 1989)\nSignal (1 July 1990)\nTwo Hearts (25 April 1991)\nHoliday (12 December 1991)\nTwo Spirits (22 July 1992)\nWindow (1 July 1993)\nHome Made (21 April 1994)\nEmotional Engine (12 December 1994)\nTwo Bridges (1 August 1996)\nGolden Best(Singles+) (20 November 2002)\nPsyclopedia (12 December 2012)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nTeenage (22 May 1985)\nBrand-New Menu (21 November 1985)\nAnother Diary (5 March 1986)\nWoman・S (21 November 1986)\nSilent Song (サイレント・ソング) (26 February 1987)\nLemon no Yuuki (Lemonの勇気) (21 October 1987)\nAngel Night (Angel Night~天使のいる場所~) (21 April 1988)\nBara to Non Fiction (薔薇とノンフィクション) (21 July 1988)\nParachute Limit (21 October 1988)\nChild (21 January 1989)\nFuzzy Pain (ファジィな痛み) (21 July 1989)\nWondering up and down~Mizu no Marginal (Wondering up and down~水のマージナル~) (1 December 1989)\nAsobi ni Kitene (遊びにきてね) (21 May 1990)\nKisses (21 September 1990)\nFriends or Lovers (10 February 1991)\nDenki to Mint-Movie Mix (電気とミント-Movie Mix) (1 March 1991)\nAsa~From day to day (あさ~From day to day) (23 August 1991)\nMoonshine (1 December 1991)\nAozora wa Tenki Ame-Live Version(青空は天気雨-Live Version) (21 September 1992)\nAozora ga Ippai (青空がいっぱい) (2 June 1993)\nHana no Youni (花のように) (21 February 1994)\nBe with You (21 November 1994)\n\n\n=== Video Singles ===\nDenki to Mint (電気とミント) (CD-V) (5 March 1988)\nFrom The Planet With Love (New Version) / BRAND-NEW MENU (12inch Version) / Chasing The Rainbow / 青空は天気雨 / 電気とミント(ビデオクリップ)\n\nAsobi ni Kitene (遊びにきてね) (VSD) (21 September 1990)\nAsobi ni Kitene (Video Clip) (遊びにきてね(ビデオクリップ))\n\n\n=== Videos ===\nPsy・S 4Size\nLive Psy・S Non-Fiction Tour '88-'89\nLooking for the “Atlas” Tour\nTri-Psy・S\nSignal Victory Tour\nParadise Tour\nMusic In Your Eyes\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\nLive Psy・S Non-Fiction Tour '88-'89/Psy・S 4Size (7 September 2005)\n\n\n=== Video CD ===\nMusic in your Eyes (1994)\n\n\n== References =="

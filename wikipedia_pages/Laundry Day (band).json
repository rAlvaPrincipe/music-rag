    "text": "Laundry Day (stylized in all caps) is an American pop rock band from Manhattan, New York, formed in 2018. The group currently consists of vocalist Jude Ciulla-Lipkin, vocalist and drummer Sawyer Nunes, guitarist Henry Weingartner, and bassist Henry Pearl. The band was formed while all four current members were students at Beacon High School.\n\n\n== History ==\nVocalists Sawyer Nunes and Jude Ciulla-Lipkin, who had been friends prior to starting the band, began making music together while attending Beacon High School in the Hell's Kitchen area of Manhattan in New York City. Nunes had previously appeared on Broadway, in the original Broadway casts of Finding Neverland as George Llewelyn Davies and Gettin' the Band Back Together as Ricky. After the two created their first song together, their friends/classmates Henry Weingartner and Etai Abramovich joined the band. Henry Pearl, another friend from Beacon, joined the band afterwards.\nLaundry Day released their debut album, Trumpet Boy, in March 2018, via their independent label Polo and Fomo. They embarked on their first national tour, the All My Friends Tour, in the same month, to further promote the album. Their second studio album, Homesick, was released in March 2019. The album was co-produced with Romil Hemnani of Brockhampton and recorded partially at Shangri-La Studio. The band performed at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in October 2019, and in November 2019, they performed at Tyler, the Creator's Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival. That same month, they played as an opening act for The 1975 during the North American leg of their A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships Tour, and played as an opening act for Clairo in December 2019 during the European leg of her Immunity Tour.  Their song \"Friends\" was used as the closing song in the season 3 finale of the Netflix series On My Block. In early 2024 they played as the opening act for the Spend The Night Tour by Teezo Touchdown. In May 2024 they opened for Ed Sheeran at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.\nIn 2024, drummer Etai Abramovich stepped away from the band to pursue personal ambitions.\n\n\n== Public image ==\nNME placed Laundry Day on the NME 100, their annual list of \"essential new artists\", in January 2020.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nLaundry Day have cited their biggest influences as rapper Tyler, the Creator and the band Brockhampton. Laundry Day's members are multi-instrumentalists, and often play different instruments on their songs than those which they play live. Their \"DIY ethos\" has been remarked upon by various publications. Their sound has been defined as \"genre-defying\".\nLaundry Day also displays their talent in the video field with their abstract music videos and interesting documentaries that go behind the scenes of many of their songs, in which they upload to their YouTube channel.  In 2024 the band released and screened a documentary in theaters that takes you behind the scenes of Laundry Day's 2023 album Younger Than I Was Before directed by lead singer Jude Ciulla-Lipkin.\n\n\n== Social Media ==\nLaundry Day created their TikTok account in late 2021 where they have over 200,000 followers as of July 2024. They post videos displaying their young and fun personalities and have gained an audience on the app and is a key part of how they have rose to popularity. They also have presence on many other social media platforms.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\n\nSawyer Nunes – vocals, guitar, keyboard, drums (2018–present)\nJude Ciulla-Lipkin – vocals (2018–present)\nHenry Weingartner – guitar, vocals (2018–present)\nHenry Pearl – bass (2018–present)\nFormer members\n\nEtai Abramovich – drums (2018–2024)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music Videos ===\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\nHeadlining\n\nAll My Friends Tour (2019)\nTogether Forever Tour (2019)\nWe Switched Bodies Tour (2022)\nOpening acts\n\nClairo – Immunity Tour (2019)\nThe 1975 – A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships Tour (2019)\nNeon Trees - The Favorite Daze Tour (2023)\nTeezo Touchdown - The Spend The Night Tour (2024)\n\n\n== References =="

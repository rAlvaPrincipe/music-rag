    "text": "The Bucktown Five was a jazz group active in the early 1920s in the Chicago area of the United States. The group played a New Orleans style of collective improvisational jazz and were forerunners of the Chicago style which developed in later years. About eighteen months after breaking up, many of the same players recorded in Chicago as the Stomp Six. The Bucktown Five also recorded with Bix Beiderbecke.\nThe band's name is linked with New Orleans, as Bucktown is a Chicago neighborhood, but also the name of the settlement that grew up on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain after the close of Storyville. It became a smaller version of that district.\n\n\n== Members ==\nGuy Carey - trombone\nVolly De Faut - clarinet, alto saxophone\nMarvin Saxbe - banjo, guitar, cymbal\nBill Shelby - banjo\nMuggsy Spanier - cornet\nMel Stitzel - piano\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe group recorded on the Claxtonola and other labels.

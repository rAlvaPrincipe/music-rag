    "text": "The Mrs is an American pop-rock band based in Austin, Texas. Founded by drummer Andra Liemandt with longtime friend Jenny Mason (bass) as the first recruited member, the band took form in July 2013 after a nationwide search of websites and social media for musicians. Eventually, the pair found what they were looking for in their own backyard of Austin, in solo artists Larissa Ness (keyboards/vocals) and Mandy Prater (guitar/vocals).\nThe band first gained attention in 2014 with their \"Magic Mirror\" video, which featured their first single, \"Enough.\" In the video, strangers approach a mirror in an Austin mall, and are challenged to view themselves as others see them, instead of listening to their own critical self talk. The emotional video became a viral success, accruing over  5 million views on YouTube.  It was featured on Good Morning America, The Queen Latifah Show, local TV and radio, and countless blogs; it was also translated by fans into multiple languages. The Mrs' Magic Mirror was taken on tour around Texas and to Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, and was made into an iPhone app.\nThe popularity of the “Magic Mirror” video pushed \"Enough\" onto the charts after its official release, in August 2015. In November 2015, after the release of the Enough EP (dated Sep 23, 2015), the title track reached Number 10 on FMQB Adult Contemporary Top 200. During this period, it was one of the most added tracks in independent radio station playlists.\nFollowing Enough, the band partnered with SAFE, an Austin-based nonprofit working to end sexual assault and exploitation, child abuse, and domestic violence, to release \"Draw the Line\" and drive awareness during Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April 2016.\nOn March 10, 2017, the band released their first full-length, self-titled album, The Mrs, consisting of eleven tracks. And EP, Five Minutes, was released on September 7, 2018.\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\nThe early days of The Mrs were spent under the tutelage of Grammy-award winning engineer/producer/songwriter/musician Robert Arbittier, who made his career working with Stevie Wonder as a touring keyboardist and programmer, and whose songwriting and producing credits include such names as Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. Arbittier and business partner Gary Odante (engineer, Songs in the Key of Life, ”Gary Olazabal”) were the production team for The Mrs' early singles and the Enough EP.  Arbittier also at times served as musical director and manager for the band. The band co-wrote their hit single “Enough” with Arbittier, as well as an unreleased song, “You Were There.”\nFrom 2013 to 2016 The Mrs worked with many Platinum and Grammy-award winning songwriters:\n\nWeeks after forming, in August 2013, the band met with British songwriter Pam Sheyne, best known for co-writing Christina Aguilera's Grammy Award-winning single, \"Genie in a Bottle.\"  Three songs from this writing session were penned at Steven Tyler's oceanside Maui retreat: \"The Mrs,\" \"Tug of Love,\" and \"Between the Sheets.”\n“You Told Me” was written with L.A.-based, husband-wife songwriting team, Joerg Kohring and Jessica Niven-Kohring.\nThe 2016 single “Light it Up” was co-written by musician Wes Cunningham and acclaimed song-writer Rob Arbittier. Rob has worked with a diverse group of artists, including Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Jennifer Lopez.\nThe band called upon singer/songwriter Susan Gibson, writer of the Dixie Chicks hit \"Wide Open Spaces,” to help them approach the task of writing a song of hope for people who have suffered from domestic violence and sexual assault. The creation of The Mrs’ 2016 single, “Draw the Line,” also involved a partnership with SAFE (then SafePlace and Austin Children’s Shelter). All proceeds from the sale of the single go to benefit SAFE and its programs. This partnership also marked a new collaboration with musical producer Dwight Baker, who produced the song at his Matchbox Studios in Austin.\nIn 2016, the band pulled in the production team of Jimmy McGorman and Robb Vallier to help create what would become 2017’s full-length album release, The Mrs team spent two weekends in Austin with the band, which resulted in 11 songs written in The Mrs' signature roundtable style. Pre-production began immediately, and the bulk of the recording took place at Arlyn Studios in Austin, over the course of eight days in late March, 2016. The album was mixed by Chris Thompson and mastered by Rueben Coehn.\n\n\n== Charity Work ==\nPhilanthropy is central to the operation of The Mrs. In addition to their cornerstone outreach project, the Magic Mirror, which has helped thousands to see themselves in a more positive light, their extensive charity work—both as entertainment and as a sponsor—includes working with organizations such as SAFE, Hand To Hold, National Eating Disorder Association, Just Keep Livin’ Foundation, Survive 2 Thrive, Seton Breast Cancer Foundation, Dell Children’s Hospital Blood and Cancer Center, Center for Child Protection, The Kindness Campaign, and many others.\n\n\n== Awards and Recognitions ==\nThe Mrs received an official decree from the City of Austin that April 8, 2016, was to be called “Draw the Line Day” in the city. Mayor Steve Adler praised The Mrs for writing their song “Draw the Line,” the purpose of which was to bring awareness to the local organization SAFE (Stop Abuse For Everyone) and its work to eradicate domestic violence and sexual assault.\n\n\n== Notable Performances ==\nMay 1, 2014 – Charity benefit event for children’s music education charity, Kids In a New Groove, with a lineup featuring Courtyard Hounds (featuring Martie Maguire and Emily Robison of the Dixie Chicks).\nJuly 26, 2014 – Keynote performance and presentation of “Magic Mirror” video at BlogHer 2014 National Conference in San Jose, California.\nNovember 2014 – Texas tour on the road with “Magic Mirror” (various).\nFebruary 22, 2015 – Mall of America at the Hard Rock Cafe to kick off third annual National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) Walk.\nApril 29, 2015 – \"You Told Me” release party on Top of The Rock, top floor observation deck of Rockefeller Center.

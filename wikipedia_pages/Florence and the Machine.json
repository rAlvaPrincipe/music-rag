    "text": "Florence and the Machine (stylised as Florence + the Machine) are an English indie rock band formed in London in 2007 by lead vocalist Florence Welch, keyboardist Isabella Summers, guitarist Rob Ackroyd, drummer Christopher Lloyd Hayden & harpist Tom Monger. The band has comprised a number of other musicians. The band's music has received acclaim across the media, especially from the BBC, which played a large part in their rise to prominence by promoting Florence and the Machine as part of BBC Music Introducing. At the 2009 Brit Awards they received the Brit Awards \"Critics' Choice\" award. The band's music is renowned for its dramatic, eccentric production and Welch's powerful vocals.\nThe band's debut studio album, Lungs, was released on 3 July 2009, and held the number-two position for its first five weeks on the UK Albums Chart. On 17 January 2010, the album reached the top position, after being on the chart for twenty-eight consecutive weeks. As of October 2010, the album had been in the top forty in the United Kingdom for sixty-five consecutive weeks, making it one of the best-selling albums of 2009 and 2010. The group's second studio album, Ceremonials, released in October 2011, entered the charts at number one in the UK and number six in the US. The band's third studio album, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, was released on 2 June 2015. It topped the UK charts, and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, their first to do so. The album reached number one in a total of eight countries and the top ten of twenty. Also in 2015, the band was the headlining act at Glastonbury Festival, making Welch the first British female headliner of the 21st century.\nFlorence and the Machine's sound has been described as a combination of various genres, including rock and soul. Lungs (2009) won the Brit Award for Best British Album in 2010. Florence and the Machine have been nominated for six Grammy Awards including Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Album. Additionally, the band performed at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize Concert.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2007–2010: Formation and Lungs ===\n\nThe name of Florence and the Machine is attributed to Florence Welch's teenage collaboration with Isabella \"Machine\" Summers. Welch and Summers performed together for a time under the name Florence Robot/Isa Machine. According to Welch, \"The name Florence and the Machine started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot Is A Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad.\" In addition to Summers (keyboards), the current band members include musicians Robert Ackroyd (guitar), Chris Hayden (drums, percussion and backing vocals), Mark Saunders (bass guitar and percussion) and Tom Monger (harp). In the past, Welch has praised her band for understanding her creative process, claiming, \"I've worked with most of them for a long time and they know my style, know the way I write, they know what I want.\"\nIn 2007, Welch recorded with a band named Ashok, who released an album titled Plans on the Filthy Lucre/About Records label. This album included the earliest version of her later hit \"Kiss with a Fist\", which at this point was titled \"Happy Slap\".\nFlorence and the Machine released their first album Lungs in the Netherlands and Ireland on 3 July 2009. The album was produced by James Ford, Paul Epworth, Steve Mackey, Isabella Summers and Charlie Hugall. The album was officially launched with a set at the Rivoli Ballroom in Brockley, south-east London. It peaked at number one in the UK and number two in Ireland. As of 6 August 2009, the album had sold over 100,000 copies in the UK and by 10 August it had been at number two for five consecutive weeks. Following its 25 July 2009 release for download in the United States, the album entered the charts at number seventeen on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, ultimately peaking at number one. The album was released physically in the US on 20 October by Universal Republic.\n\n\"Kiss with a Fist\" was released as the album's lead single on 9 June 2008. The track was featured on the soundtrack to the films Wild Child (2008), Jennifer's Body (2009), and St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold (2009), as well as in the television series 90210, Community and Saving Grace. Follow-up single \"Dog Days Are Over\", released on 1 December 2008, was recorded with no instruments in a studio the \"size of a loo\". The song was used in the American television series Gossip Girl, Covert Affairs, in the British television series Skins, and in the theatrical trailer for the 2010 comedy-drama film Eat Pray Love, starring Julia Roberts. \"Dog Days Are Over\" was also featured in the Glee episode \"Special Education\", where it was covered by Jenna Ushkowitz and Amber Riley. \"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\" was released on 22 June 2009 as the third single from the album.\nAfter the release of Lungs, \"Drumming Song\" and a cover of the Source and Candi Staton's 1986 song \"You've Got the Love\" were released as singles. \"Cosmic Love\" was released on 5 July 2010 as the sixth and final single from Lungs, with a music video having already been shot. The song was featured in several American television shows, including Grey's Anatomy, The Vampire Diaries, V, Nikita and So You Think You Can Dance. The band also made a guest appearance on 7 February 2011 episode of Gossip Girl, titled \"Panic Roommate\", where they performed an acoustic rendition of \"Cosmic Love\". On 12 May 2010, it was announced that Florence and the Machine would provide a track called \"Heavy in Your Arms\" for the soundtrack to The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, the third film of The Twilight Saga. Eclipse was released in cinemas on 30 June 2010, with \"Heavy in Your Arms\" playing during the end credits. The music video followed on 7 July 2010. An exclusive remix of \"I'm Not Calling You a Liar\" is featured in the 2011 video game Dragon Age II as \"I'm Not Calling You a Liar (Dragon Age II: Varric's Theme)\", produced by the game's composer Inon Zur.\n\n\n=== 2011–2013: Ceremonials ===\n\nThe first demo session occurred in January 2010 with Welch and Paul Epworth at a small London studio. Numerous producers expressed an interest in working on the album but Welch rejected the offers because she wanted Ceremonials to be a better version of Lungs with a \"more dark, more heavy, bigger drum sounds, bigger bass, but with more of a whole sound\". For the rest of the year work on the album continued only intermittently as the band concentrated on an extensive tour of the US, where Lungs had become popular. The majority of the writing for the album was done between January and April 2011, with recording taking place in April at Abbey Road Studios. Refinement took place at Epworth's own London studios while Welch recorded vocal tracks in various US studios, during days off from touring. The final recording session took place in July at Epworth's studio. Epworth co-wrote seven tracks. Several other British writers share credits on the album, including Summers, Kid Harpoon, James Ford and composer Eg White.\nIn June 2011, a cover of the Buddy Holly song \"Not Fade Away\", which Florence and the Machine recorded for the tribute album Rave On Buddy Holly tied to Holly's seventy-fifth birthday year, was released and they performed Ceremonials' setup track \"What the Water Gave Me\" at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, California. In August 2011, the single \"What the Water Gave Me\" was released on iTunes along with an accompanying video on the band's website and YouTube channel. The video drew 1.5 million YouTube views in two days and the track received play on US alternative radio with strong support from Los Angeles radio station KROQ. The single \"Shake It Out\" was released over the internet in September 2011, with standard release 11 October. In Australia, the song was playlisted at Triple J and Nova radio networks and received strong airplay in Scandinavia, Italy and Canada.\nThe band's second studio album, Ceremonials, was released on 28 October 2011. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and number six on the US Billboard 200. On 12 January 2012, Florence and the Machine were nominated for two Brit Awards, Best British Female Artist and British Album of the Year, with the awards ceremony taking place on 21 February 2012 at the O2 Arena, London. On 26 April 2012, the band released \"Breath of Life\", a song which was recorded as the official theme song for the film Snow White and the Huntsman. On 5 July 2012, a remix of \"Spectrum (Say My Name)\" by Scottish musician Calvin Harris was released as the fourth single from Ceremonials, becoming the band's first UK number-one hit. Welch expressed excitement about putting new material together for a third studio album after the band finishes touring at the end of September 2012. Welch collaborated for a second time with Harris on the song \"Sweet Nothing\", released on 12 October 2012 as a single from Harris's third studio album 18 Months (2012). The song entered at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming their second collaborative number-one single.\nIn mid-2012, it was announced that Universal Republic Records was going defunct, moving all artists including Florence and the Machine to Republic Records making the label itself revived. In late August 2012, Welch told Style magazine that she plans to take a twelve-month hiatus before starting work on the band's next studio album, stating, \"There's a big 'take a year off' plan. The record company have put no pressure on me for the next album. They've said I can have as long as I want.\" In December 2012, Florence and the Machine were nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album for Ceremonials and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for \"Shake It Out\" at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards. On 4 April 2013, it was announced that Florence and the Machine had written a song for Baz Luhrmann's film rendition of The Great Gatsby (2013), titled \"Over the Love\", which was released on 17 April 2013 on SoundCloud.\n\n\n=== 2014–2016: How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful ===\n\nOn 4 June 2014, Welch told NME that the band's third studio album was in the works. In January 2015, a fansite posted a photo showing Florence and the Machine's upcoming album being mixed in a recording studio. On 9 February, the band played all the songs from the new album in full, amongst them \"Ship to Wreck\", \"Caught\", \"Delilah\" and the album's first single, \"What Kind of Man\" in a private London show.\nThe next day, on 10 February, the band released a short music video for the title track of their studio album, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, which also acted as the official album teaser, directed by Tabitha Denholm and Vincent Haycock and shot in Mexico. The single and album were available to pre-order subsequently on all popular online music stores. The music video is just under three minutes as compared to the five minute album version of the track. On 12 February, the album's lead single \"What Kind of Man\" was revealed on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show, followed by the release of music video later that day on band's Vevo channel via YouTube.\nThe band released a music video of another track called \"St. Jude\" on 23 March, choreographed by Ryan Heffington and directed by Vincent Haycock, continuing the narrative from the previous video of \"What Kind of Man\".

In June 2015, it was announced that the band would headline the Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset due to the withdrawal of previous headliners Foo Fighters, after lead vocalist Dave Grohl fractured his leg on stage in Sweden. Florence and the Machine's Glastonbury set was critically acclaimed by numerous outlets. Welch thanked Grohl for his support following their choice as a replacement and wished him a speedy recovery, before performing a cover of the Foo Fighters' \"Times Like These\".

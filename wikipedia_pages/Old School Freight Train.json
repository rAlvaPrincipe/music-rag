    "text": "Old School Freight Train (OSFT) was a Charlottesville, Virginia-based band that combined bluegrass, jazz, Latin, and Celtic sounds to create their music.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe band's eponymous debut album, Old School Freight Train, was met with considerable acclaim. Relix magazine, included them in their \"Artists Too New to Know\" series in May 2005. Daniel Gewertz of the Boston Herald called them: \"The most talented young string band in the land.\"\nMandolin master David Grisman heard their music in the Fall of 2004 and invited them record at his Dawg Studios in Mill Valley, California.  He manned the production and recording himself with the help of Dave Dennison. From these sessions came Run, OSFT's second album and their first for Acoustic Disc, Grisman's acclaimed independent label.  He says of the experience:\n\nAfter forty years of recording acoustic music, it's not very often that a new band catches (and keeps) my attention. Old School Freight Train has done that and more. They are certainly an emerging force to reckon with in today's wide world of acoustic music.\nThey have backed David Grisman as his band on several tours in 2005 and 2006. They opened for Merle Haggard on May 3, 2006, at the Charlottesville Pavilion.  They were co-billed with King Wilkie at the Starr Hill Music Hall in Charlottesville, Virginia November 15, 2006.  They played at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., on September 23, 2006.\nThe band's tour schedule has included the Newport Folk Festival, MerleFest, Wintergrass, Strawberry Music Festival, and the Menokin Bluegrass Festival in Warsaw, Virginia. In 2007, they played the Stagecoach Festival in Indio, California.\nSix Years was released on March 17, 2009.  The group has since disbanded.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nTim Dickinson, National Affairs Correspondent for Rolling Stone, said of the group's sound:\n\nShades of Jack Johnson, Ben Harper...even a kiss of Van Morrison. With Not Like The Others, Old School Freight Train is off on a timeless new track, blending roots and rock to create a sound that's all their own.\nRelix magazine, including OSFT in their \"Artists Too New to Know\" series in May 2005, described their playing as:\n\nMusically daring, the outfit melds folk, bluegrass, jazz, soul and pop into a seamless blend with invigorating and accomplished picking.\nDaniel Gewertz of the Boston Herald noted:\n\n...they finesse everything from breakneck bluegrass and seductive, sinuous Gypsy jazz to a dynamic, grassed-up version of Stevie Wonder's 'Superstition.' There are even brief side-trips to Ireland and Latin America. This Virginia-based Freight Train hurtles along the roots-music tracks with grace and style.\nDavid Grisman, who recorded their album Run on his independent label, said:\n\nTheir finely crafted tunes and innovative arrangements bring creativity, taste and wit to a broad spectrum of contemporary styles - vocal and instrumental, all firmly rooted in many traditions.\nIn his review of Six Years, John Borgmeyer said in the C-Ville Weekly:\n\nSix Years marks an evolution for Charlottesville's Old School Freight Train, in which the band leaps from the well-traveled track of \"newgrass\" onto a blend of pop and traditional music that's all its own.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\nOld School Freight Train's vocalist, songwriter, and guitarist was Jesse Harper. Pete Frostic played mandolin, Nate Leath played fiddle, Darrell Muller played upright bass, and Nick Falk was the drummer.\nFormer members have included Ann Marie Calhoun (née Simpson) on the fiddle, and Ben Krakauer on banjo. They went on to play in Walker's Run.  Calhoun has also performed with Jethro Tull, Steve Vai, and well as Ringo Starr.  She was also the \"My GRAMMY Moment 2008\" winner on the 50th Annual GRAMMY Awards, chosen to perform with the Foo Fighters live.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nOld School Freight Train (2002), Courthouse Records – ASIN: B000083GLJ\nPickin' On John Mayer: A Bluegrass Tribute (2003), Various Artists CMH Records\nPickin' On Wilco: Casino Side (2004), CMH Records – ASIN: B000294ROE\nRun (2005), Acoustic Disc – ASIN: B00080Z66K\nPickin' On Coldplay: A Bluegrass Tribute (2005), Various Artists CMH Records – ASIN: B00070Q886\nPickin' On John Mayer Vol. 2 (2005), Various Artists CMH Records\nLive in Ashland (2006) – ASIN: B000WGX6LM\nSix Years (2009) Red Distribution — ASIN: B001QWEE3A\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\nJosh Ritter, Live at the 9:30 Club (April 19, 2008) – \"Next to the Last True Romantic\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"New Dawgs: Old School Freight Train\" by Rudi Greenberg, May 27, 2008, Express\n\"Old School Freight Train: Not a 1-way ticket\" Lancaster New Era, July 26, 2007\n\n\n== External links ==\nMySpace Page Old School Freight Train\nAcoustic Disc profile\nOld School Freight Train collection at the Internet Archive's live music archive"

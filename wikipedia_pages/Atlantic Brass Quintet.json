    "text": "The Atlantic Brass Quintet is an American brass quintet that has been in existence for over 30 years.\nFounded in 1985 by John Manning, Joseph Foley, John Faieta, Tsuyoshi Taramotoi, and Bob Rasmussen, the quintet has won Grand prizes at the Coleman Chamber Music Competition, Carmel Chamber Music Society Competition, the Shoreline Alliance Chamber Music Competition, the Summit Brass First International Brass Ensemble Competition, and the Rafael Mendez International Brass Quintet Competition. The group was named \"Young Artists of 1988\" by Musical America. In May 1992, by unanimous decision, the Quintet won the \"Premiere Prix\" at the International Brass Competition of Narbonne, France.\nThe quintet has performed at Carnegie Hall, Weill Recital Hall, the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, the Fleet Boston Celebrity Series, Tanglewood, and the White House, and has been the resident brass quintet of Boston University, the Boston University Tanglewood Institute, and the Boston Conservatory.\nThe quintet hosts the Atlantic Brass Quintet Summer Seminar each year.  Established in 1993, the Summer Seminar is a 2-week immersive brass quintet camp with 55 participants (ranging from high school through college, post-grad, pre-professional, and adults) and 10 faculty, including the members of the Atlantic and Triton brass quintets.\nMembers of the group have, and continue to compose and arrange music for brass quintet.  Many of these compositions and arrangements are published by the Atlantic Brass Quintet and sold on the group's website.\nThe current members of the Atlantic Brass Quintet are Thomas Bergeron and Andrew Sorg, trumpets; Seth Orgel, French Horn; Timothy Albright, trombone; and John Manning, tuba.\nThe group's touring repertoire is known for its diverse stylistic influences, including baroque and classical/romanic transcriptions, jazz arrangements, and traditional Balkan brass music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nQuintet Matinee (2015)\nAtlantic Brass Quintet, University of Connecticut Wind Ensembles & Jeffrey H.

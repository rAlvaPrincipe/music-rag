    "text": "Die Apokalyptischen Reiter (German for \"The Apocalyptic Riders\") is a German heavy metal band formed in Weimar in 1995.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe band's original style, featured on their releases up to and including Allegro Barbaro and on a few songs on All You Need Is Love, consists of death/thrash metal blended with melodic compositions. In later albums, the death metal influence declined, resulting in less chaotic composition (often centered around a verse and chorus with a bridge and solo), more constant tempo, longer songs and clean vocals (although not exclusively). This resulted in a more polished and accessible sound. The band uses lyrics in both English and German with a shift from mainly English songs to more German ones on recent albums (Licht is entirely in German).\nThe release of Have a Nice Trip marked somewhat of a turning point for the band; although they retained the essence of heavy metal, they began experimenting with many other styles of music such as ambient and jazz.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent line-up\n\nFuchs (Daniel Täumel) – lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1995–present)\nVolk-Man (Volkmar Weber) – bass, screamed vocals (1995–present)\nTitus Maximus – lead guitar (2023–present)\nRohgarr (Euch Rohgarr) – Drums (2023–present)\n\n\tLine-up at Rockharz Open Air 2018\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nFormer members\n\nSkelleton – drums, screamed vocals (1995–2000)\nPitrone (Peter Pfau) – lead guitar (2002–2008)\nLady Cat-Man (Cathleen Gliemann) – lead guitar (2008–2009)\nDr. Pest (Mark Szakul) – keyboards (1995–2021)\nSir G.

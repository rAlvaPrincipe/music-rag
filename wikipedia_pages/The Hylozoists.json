    "text": "The Hylozoists are a Canadian instrumental rock supergroup formed in 2001 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The band's name is derived from hylozoism and was started as a side project of record producer and multi-instrumentalist Paul Aucoin.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Hylozoists is an instrumental band conceived by producer Paul Aucoin in 2001.  Aucoin wrote and recorded their first album La Nouvelle Gauche (using a line-up of musicians mainly from Halifax) in his studio in Nova Scotia. The Hylozoists were moved to the back burner as Aucoin had to return to his responsibilities for the band The Sadies.\nIn 2004 Aucoin moved to Toronto where he revived The Hylozoists.  This conception of The Hylozoists would consist of musicians from other bands such as The Weakerthans, FemBots, and Cuff the Duke.  It was here that Aucoin started fresh and captured the collective sound of his new collaborators, he shed the idea of a “solo project” and created a full-blown supergroup.\nThe group's third album, L'île de Sept Villes, received a Juno Award nomination in 2010 for Instrumental Album of the Year.\nIn addition to his work with Hylozoists, Aucoin has also produced albums for other artists, including Cuff the Duke's Sidelines of the City, The Golden Dogs' Big Eye Little Eye and John K. Samson's Provincial.\n\n\n== Music ==\nTheir MySpace page describes their music as Indie/Classical/Emotronic.  This is a pretty accurate description of their music, especially considering their instrumentation.  A majority of their instruments (vibes, glockenspiel, organ, violin, viola) are primarily used in classical music, and in some instances jazz.  These instruments interact in conjunction with the other “non-classical\" instruments (drums, pedal steel, guitar, bass).  What makes their sound unique is the application of the instruments, not necessarily the instrumentation itself.  While using vibes and a glock is unique for an indie band, what makes it interesting is that some of their songs sound like something out of a feature film.  Aucoin had a musical education (i.e. he had either conservatory tutoring or maybe even post-secondary, classical training) and he uses it in an effective way, not just in writing but also in orchestrating.  In their song \"Warning Against Judging\", the opening minute is played on glock, organ and a little bit of a guitar - if you were to replace it with strings it would be something from an orchestral movie score.  After the first minute of the song drums and bass come in, as well as violin and trumpet.  It still keeps the feeling of a movie score, something that has been thought out by someone knowledgeable in orchestration.\nWhat is interesting about this band is not only its make up, instrumentation wise, but also its origins and albums.  Technically this band originated in Halifax and then moved to Toronto during its second inception.  Their first album, done in Halifax, was titled La Nouvelle Gauche. Their second album, done in Toronto, was titled La Fin du Monde.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPaul Aucoin(vibraphone, glockenspiel, drums) — founder, also from The Sadies, Cuff the Duke, Hopeful Monster\nRandy Lee (violin)\nPaul Lowman (bass) — from Cuff the Duke\nGreg Millson (drums) — from Gentleman Reg & Great Lake Swimmers\nChristopher Sandes (piano, organ) — from Cuff the Duke\nFrançois Turenne (guitar)\nEric Woolston (vibraphone, glockenspiel, drums)\n\n\n=== Regular touring members ===\nPatrick Conan (vibraphone, glockenspiel, drums) — from Tricky Woo, Cuff the Duke\nMatthew Faris (drums) — from Cuff the Duke\n\n\n=== Past (and part-time touring) members ===\nRich Aucoin\nBryden Baird (horns)\nJason Ball (organ, vocals) — from Hopeful Monster\nDave Christensen (woodwinds) — from the Heavy Blinkers, Hopeful Monster\nPeter Conrad (cello)\nJonina Gibson (viola)\nRob Gordon (drums)\nMonica Guenter (viola) — from Christine Fellows' band\nTaylor Knox (drums)\nNathan Lawr (drums) — from Sea Snakes\nDave MacKinnon (vocals) — from FemBots, Hummer\nRuth Minnikin (vocals) — from the Heavy Blinkers, The Guthries\nDamian Monyhan (drums) — from Hopeful Monster\nDale Murray (pedal steel, guitar) — from The Guthries, Hopeful Monster\nMichael Olsen (cello)\nOwen Pallett (violin) — aka \"Final Fantasy\"\nLukas Pearse (double bass)\nJulie Penner (violin) — from Broken Social Scene, Do Make Say Think\nWayne Petti (piano, vocals) — from Cuff the Duke\nBrian Poirier (\"weird\") — from FemBots, Hummer\nJeremy Strachan (guitar) — from Rockets Red Glare, Sea Snakes, Hopeful Monster, Feuermusik\nJason Tait (vibraphone, glockenspiel) — from The Weakerthans, FemBots, Broken Social Scene, Christine Fellows' band\nLeanne Zacharias (cello) — from Christine Fellows' band\n\n\n== Discography ==\nLa Nouvelle Gauche (2002)\nLa Fin du Monde (2006)\nL'île de Sept Villes (2009)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMusic of Canada\nCanadian rock\nList of Canadian musicians\nList of bands from Canada\nCategory:Canadian musical groups\n\n\n== References =="

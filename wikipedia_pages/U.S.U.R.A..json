The name is derived from that of Maiolini's mother, Ursula. The group is best known for the 1992-93 hit single (and later album) \"Open Your Mind\", featuring a dialog sample from the film Total Recall, as well as a vocal sound from \"Solid\" by Ashford & Simpson, and incorporating sampled elements from the Simple Minds song \"New Gold Dream\" from 1982.

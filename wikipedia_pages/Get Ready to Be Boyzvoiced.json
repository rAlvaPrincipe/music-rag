    "text": "Get Ready to Be Boyzvoiced is a 2000 Norwegian mockumentary about a fictional boy band called Boyzvoice. Outside Norway, it has been screened multiple times on Australian television channel SBS.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe band is a three-piece vocal group dominated by their utterly untalented lead singer \"M*Pete\". When they are caught lip-synching before the release of their first album, scandal erupts (fed also by their manager's physically assaulting an elderly male and an elderly female member of the Salvation Army and the revelation that M*Pete's 16-year-old girlfriend is actually only 12) and they are dropped by their record company. They consider leaving the music industry, but their manager gets them a sponsorship deal with a Norwegian fish finger manufacturer. Ultimately they bounce back to fame after an appearance at the HitAwards Norwegian music awards show.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nEspen Eckbo as M'Pete, Ove, Waldemar, Web Designer, Radio DJ, Security Guard\nØyvind Thoen as Hot Tub\nKaare Daniel Steen as Roar\nHenrik Elvestad as Manager Timothy Dahle\nLinn Skåber as Wenche Pettersen (Public Relations Manager)\nAtle Antonsen as Titano Music Festival Arranger\nJon Øigarden as Concert Arranger Sverre Bratsberg\nTrond-Viggo Torgersen as Producer Jens Ovesen\nJorunn Kjellsby as  Ingrid Lund-Bergseter (the boys' mum)\nHarald Brenna as Alf Lund-Bergseter (the boys' dad)\nIda Thorkildsen Valvik as Stine (M'Pete's girlfriend)\nBernhard Arnø as Choreographer Stian Mørdre\nNikis Theophilakis as Lars Erik Martinsen (of Frionor Seafoods)\nTony Totino as Brian Kauffman (Head of record company)\nTrond Høvik as Salvation Army Officer\nEivind Sander as Se & Hør Journalist\nThorkil Johan Aschehoug as Vocal coach\nArild Svensgam as Head of removals firm where M'Pete and Hot Tub work\nBodil Lahelle as Lady of the Salvation Army\nEspen Søland as Vocal Analyst\nHeine Totland as himself\nPeter Singsaas as himself\nEspen Lind as himself\nMorten Abel as himself\nChristian Ingebrigtsen as himself\nBen Adams as himself\nPaul Marazzi as himself\nMark Read as himself\nDorthe Skappel as herself\nPer Kristian Indrehus as himself\nIngrid Boon Ulfsby as M'Pete's Cousin in \"Cousin\" video\n\n\n== Production ==\nAlthough the actors portraying band members pretend to be utterly talentless and unable to get one single note right in the film, all Boyzvoices vocals were in reality performed by actor Øyvind Thoen (Hot Tub), and, on occasion, actor Espen Eckbo (M'Pete).\n\n\n== External links ==\nGet Ready to Be Boyzvoiced at IMDb\nMovietrailer from filmweb.no (QuickTime)"

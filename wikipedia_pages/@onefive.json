    "text": "@onefive (Japanese: ワンファイブ, Hepburn: Wanfaibu) is a Japanese girl group consisting of Kano Fujihira, Soyoka Yoshida, Tsugumi Aritomo, and Momoe Mori. The group was formed in October 2019, in the year all the members turned 15 years old. In addition to music, they have been involved in modeling, acting, and other activities while focusing on their \"Japanese Classy Crush\" concept. They are represented by the talent agency Amuse Inc. and are signed with the record label Avex Trax.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name @onefive was chosen because the members were 15 years old at the time of formation, and because it can be pronounced in Japanese as ichi-go (lit. 'one-five'), referring to the concept of ichi-go ichi-e, which the members value. The \"@\" symbol, which is silent, was included in the name to mean \"from us\" and \"now from this place\". Fans of @onefive are collectively referred to as @fifth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2019–2021: Formation and early years ===\n@onefive was formed in October 2019 by four graduating members of the Japanese idol group Sakura Gakuin, including Kano Fujihira, who was one of the kawaii metal band Babymetal's three rotating \"Avengers\" support dancers. On October 15, 2019, the group created social media accounts on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, but the identities of its members were kept secret. On October 19, 2019, while the members were still in Sakura Gakuin, their identities were revealed during the Sakura Gakuin Festival 2019 at the Kanagawa Arts Theatre. During the encore of the show, after performing as members of Sakura Gakuin, they performed their debut single \"Pinky Promise\" as @onefive for the first time. The choreography for the single was created by Mikiko. \"Pinky Promise\" was released as a digital single on the following day, October 20, 2019, officially marking @onefive's debut.\nShortly after its formation, the group was unable to perform in-person events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, relying instead on an online presence to hold virtual events. Notable virtual events included the release event for the CD single \"Mada Minu Sekai\" (まだ見ぬ世界) on July 19, 2020, and the concert @onefive Online Live: Blue Winter 2020 on December 22, 2020. The music video for the song \"Mada Minu Sekai\" was recorded by the four members at their own homes during the pandemic.\nIn January 2021, @onefive collaborated with the Japanese fashion brand Apres Jour for the outfits worn in the music video for \"BBB\". The choreography for the song was created by Minako \"Maru\" Maruyama of Elevenplay.\nOn November 1, 2021, the song \"Just for You\" was featured in the Christmas commercial of the Japanese jewelry brand The Kiss.\nOn November 24, 2021, the digital single \"Underground\" was released, which marked the first time that the members created their own choreography. They were also intimately involved in the production process of the music video, sharing their ideas on hairstyles, makeup, outfits, visuals, and cuts. The process was documented, with an emphasis on the choreography, in a four-part documentary series released on YouTube titled Their Underground (彼女たちのUnderground, Kanojo-tachi no Underground).\n\n\n=== 2022: 1518, major label debut, and TV drama ===\nOn February 2, 2022, @onefive released its first studio album, titled 1518, and pronounced ichi-go ichi-e. The \"18\" in the title represented the age that the members would be turning in the year of the album's release. The song \"1518\" on the album marked the first time that the members wrote their own lyrics. The album also highlighted @onefive's desire to be \"a group that grows up with the same generation\". All of the songs apart from \"1518\" had their lyrics primarily written by a female high school student and singer-songwriter called Yura, who was the same age as the members of @onefive. Furthermore, the music video for \"Lalala Lucky\" was produced in collaboration with students of N High School and in cooperation with Adobe. \"Lalala Lucky\" was also featured in a web commercial for the Japanese hair dye brand Beautylabo.\nOn February 20, 2022, as the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic continued to change, the group was able to hold its first in-person solo concert with an audience, titled @onefive 1st Live: 1518, in Osaka at the Umeda Club Quattro. This was followed by a second concert under the same title on March 6, 2022, in Tokyo at the Shibuya Club Quattro. During the second concert, @onefive performed a dance to the song \"Let Me Go\" by Yūki Tsujimura, who was prominently involved in the music production of the first album. The choreography and stage lighting for the dance performance were produced by Kano Fujihira.\n@onefive's first festival performance was at Super Mawa Loop Osaka 2022 on May 8. Other festivals included Sakae Sp-ring 2022 on June 5, Yatsui Festival 2022 on June 19, and Spark 2022 in Yamanakako on July 18.\n@onefive made its major label debut with Avex Trax on November 6, 2022, when the digital single \"Miraizu\" (未来図) was released. The song was featured as the theme song for the live-action television drama adaptation of the manga If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It to the Budokan, I Would Die. The four members of @onefive were cast in the drama as members of the fictional idol group ChamJam. Namely, Fujihira as Maki Hakata, Yoshida as Yumeri Mizumori, Aritomo as Yūka Teramoto, and Mori as Sorane Matsuyama. The drama was broadcast for ten episodes on ABC TV and TV Asahi from October to December 2022. \"Miraizu\" was performed in a live setting for the first time on the first day of the @onefive Live 2022: Spotlight concerts, which were held in Osaka at the Umeda Club Quattro on November 6, 2022, and in Tokyo at The Garden Hall on November 13, 2022. \n\n\n=== 2023: @fifth, live-action film, and Amazon Fashion ===\nThe official fan community service of @onefive was established on January 15, 2023, in the form of a subscription-based mobile application called @onefive Premium.

The festival had a virtual reality component utilizing the Japanese metaverse platform Cluster, as well as a real life component in the form of an art exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo. The members of @onefive created pieces of pixel art depicting their @chib15 characters for the festival, which were both physically displayed at the exhibition and virtually granted as NFTs to those who purchased tickets to the metaverse venue in Cluster. A series of virtual events had been planned to take place at the metaverse venue from December 9, 2023, to March 3, 2024, involving the various participating artists. @onefive's event was a metaverse party where attendees would dress their avatars in neo-retro style clothing, as seen in the music video for \"F.A.F.O\", and dance to the group's music.\nIn the final quarter of 2023, the group held two concerts under the title @onefive Live 2023: No15e Maker.

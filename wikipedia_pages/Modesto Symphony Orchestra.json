With your cooperation and assistance, I believe we will be the only city of its size in the United States that can boast of having a symphony orchestra. We aim to give several concerts this winter and play the best there is in music.\"\nIn 1977, the MSO became a fully professional ensemble. Today, it consists of 75 - 85 professional musicians from the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay area, and is under the artistic direction of David Lockington, who began his tenure in the September 2007 as the Orchestra's eighth music director.\n\n\n== Notes =="

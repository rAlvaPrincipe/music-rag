    "text": "The Overlanders were a British music group active during the 1960s.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOriginally playing folk songs, the band found success hard to come by during the beat era and so converted to a more mainstream sound. In 1964, they had a regional hit in the Chicago area of the United States, and in Australia, with a cover of \"Don't It Make You Feel Good\", a song written and recorded by The Shadows in UK. That same year, their rendition of Chad Stuart's \"Yesterday's Gone\" received much airplay in the US and became a minor hit.\nAlthough they released twelve singles on the Pye record label between 1963 and 1966, the Overlanders' only British hit was a cover version of the Beatles' \"Michelle\". It reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in January 1966 and beat off a rival recording by David and Jonathan, whose version was produced by George Martin and featured arrangements by Tony Hatch.\nA collection of complete recordings, titled  Michelle: The Pye Anthology, was released on CD by Castle Records in 2001.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nThe original trio were:\n\nPaul Arnold – lead guitar, vocals (born Paul Arnold Friswell, 18 August 1942, Bretford, Rugby, Warwickshire)\nLaurie Mason – piano, percussion, vocals (born 1 November 1940, Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire)\nPeter Bartholomew – guitar, vocals (born 20 May 1941, Andover, Hampshire)\nThis line-up was augmented in concert by:\n\nRick Wild – vocals, keyboards (born in West Yorkshire)\nAlan Warran – drums\nTerry Widlake – bass (born Harry Terence Widlake, 21 April 1942, Birmingham, Warwickshire)\nPaul Russell - first drummer of band, joined same time as Terry Widlake, was drummer for approx a year, leaving in January 1966.\nBoth Widlake and Russell came from \"the Sherwoods\"\n\nBrian Middleditch – original drummer\nDavid Banks – drums\nDavid Walsh – drums (born 10 August 1947, Birmingham, Warwickshire)\nDavid \"Kip\" Stewart – guitar\nAndy Scarisbrick – guitar\nWhen Arnold left in late 1966 to pursue a solo career, he was replaced by Ian Griffiths.

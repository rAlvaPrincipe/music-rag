    "text": "Shivaree was an Americana and alternative country band from United States founded in 1997, consisting of Ambrosia Parsley (vocals), Danny McGough (keyboard), and Duke McVinnie (guitar). Shivaree is best known for the song \"Goodnight Moon\", released in 1999, which was featured in the tv series Dawson's Creek, and in films such as Kill Bill: Volume 2, and Silver Linings Playbook. Shivaree officially disbanded in 2007, after a very brief promotional tour of their fourth album, Tainted Love: Mating Calls and Fight Songs, a cover album.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 1997 and took its name from the Cajun term \"shivaree\", which means, roughly, a noisy mock serenade for newlyweds. It is most commonly used along and to the west of the Mississippi River. The group credits many other musicians in its work and is usually joined by two or three collaborators when performing live. It has mentioned its use of primarily Southern American ideas and themes, citing William Faulkner as an influence. \nShivaree's best known song, \"Goodnight Moon\", was released in 1999, and was featured in Seasons 3 and 6 of the television series Dawson's Creek, in the 2012 American film Silver Linings Playbook, in the closing credits of the Quentin Tarantino 2004 film Kill Bill: Volume 2, in the closing scenes and end credits of the French comedy-drama film Ni reprise ni échangée (English title: Monique), and in a commercial for the Norwegian clothing shop Cubus. Additionally, their song, \"Little Black Mess\", was featured in the Weeds tv series episode Only Judy Can Judge.\nTheir second album, Rough Dreams, intended to be issued in 2002, was not released in North America due to contract disagreements with their record label, and for that reason the group then appeared about to split up; however, another EP and another two albums followed. The group disbanded in 2007, after a ten-years musical career where they produced four full-length albums, some of which included unreleased songs, two EPs, and eight singles. The band had approximately 500,000 sales in total.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nShivaree's band members were vocalist Ambrosia Parsley, keyboardist Danny McGough, and guitarist Duke McVinnie. Parsley was to have released a solo debut album in the spring of 2011. McGough and McVinnie continue to work independently with other artists as session musicians and producers.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nI Oughtta Give You a Shot in the Head for Making Me Live in This Dump (Oct 19, 1999)\nRough Dreams (Jun 17, 2002) – not released in USA due to disagreements with the record label.\nWho's Got Trouble?

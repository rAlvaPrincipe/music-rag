    "text": "Bad Boys Inc were a British boy band, formed in 1993 by the record producer Ian Levine. Signed to A&M Records, the members were David W. Ross (born 15 March 1974 in Bournemouth), Matthew James Pateman (born 14 May 1971 in Sidcup, Kent), Tony Dowding (born 6 September 1972 in Welwyn Garden City) and Ally Begg (born 21 August 1972 in Bury St Edmunds).\n\n\n== Career ==\nAs for many manufactured boy bands in the 1990s, Bad Boys Inc's career was short-lived, but the group initially had some success following their first UK hit single, \"Don't Talk About Love\", and enjoyed minor international success with tours and promotion in Europe and Japan. After their top 20 album Bad Boys Inc, and three top 20 singles including the top 10 hit \"More to This World\", the group went on to win international acclaim by being awarded Best International Newcomer in both Denmark and Finland in 1994. They were also the first group to appear on the UK National Lottery television programme before announcing their split on 1 March 1995. In 2016, Pateman competed in Eurovision: You Decide under the name Matthew James, but his song \"A Better Man\" lost out to Joe and Jake's winning entry \"You're Not Alone\". In 2023, Pateman joined 1990s group Let Loose as a replacement for their singer Richie Wermerling and was announced as a new member of Bucks Fizz spin-off The Fizz in 2024, alongside Nikk Mager of Phixx.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

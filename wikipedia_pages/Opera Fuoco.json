    "text": "Opera Fuoco is a French lyrical ensemble conducted by David Stern.\n\n\n== Presentation ==\nFounded by David Stern in 2003, Opera Fuoco dedicates itself to the interpretation of operatic repertoire from the beginning of the 18th to the end of the 19th centuries. Consisting of an orchestra playing on period instruments (Katharina Wolff first violin), Opera Fuoco works alongside young professional singers, recruited by audition. From 2008, the Opera Fuoco Troupe is officially created: two or three productions per year, individual support, master-classes, performances for professionals from the music world, etc... Stern and Artistic Advisor and Educational Director Jay Bernfeld jointly oversee the troupe's audition process and development.\nIn addition, David Stern strongly believes in bringing operatic repertoire to new audiences and particularly in making opera more accessible to children. Since the beginning of its residency at the Theater at Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines in 2005, many activities were led for and with the children and their families.

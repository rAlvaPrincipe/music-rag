    "text": "Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers are an Australian rock band formed in Canberra in 2015. The group consists of vocalist Anna Ryan, guitarist Scarlett McKahey, drummer Neve van Boxsel and bass guitarist Jaida Stephenson. Their debut extended play, Pretty Good for a Girl Band, was released in 2022 through Domestic La La, and won Best Independent Punk Album or EP at the 2023 AIR Awards. They released their debut studio album, I Love You, in October 2023, which peaked at number 6 on the ARIA Albums Chart.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2015–2020: Formation and early releases ===\nThe band was formed in July 2015 when all five band members – lead vocalist and bandleader Anna Ryan, lead guitarist Scarlett McKahey, drummer Neve van Boxsel, keyboardist Pip Gazard, and bassist Jaida Stephenson – were 15 year old students at the Orana Steiner School in Weston, a suburb of Canberra. Some of the band members also came from Wollongong and Melbourne. Van Boxsel had been playing drums since she was 10; Ryan had been singing for all their childhood.\nIn June 2019, the band released \"I Like That You Like That\", and were named as a Triple J Unearthed feature artist. The same year, they performed at Bigsound, Groovin' the Moo and Sydney's Laneway Festival, further touring in the 2019/2020 Falls Festival.\nOn 6 February 2020, their fourth single \"Desk Chair\" was released, with Hayden Davies of music publication Pilerats praising it for being \"gritty and rough-around-the-edges in the most charming of ways\".\n\n\n=== 2021–2022: Pretty Good for a Girl Band ===\n\nUpon signing with Domestic La La in 2021, the band's first single with the label, \"Ahhhh!\", was released on 23 July. In the Triple J Hottest 200 of 2021, their song \"AHHHH!\" made it to number 117 in the countdown. In May 2021, the band performed at a number of festivals in the United Kingdom. On 16 November, the second single \"Miss Your Birthday\" was released, co-written by Alex Lahey.\nOn 29 March 2022, the band announced their debut EP Pretty Good for a Girl Band would be released on 13 May. The news was accompanied by the release's third and final single, \"Girl Sports\", which was described by Ellie Robinson from NME as a \"notedly darker cut for the Canberra-native quartet\" featuring \"more grisly guitar runs, snappy, cymbal-heavy drums and cutthroat lead vocals\". The band embarked on a nationwide tour supporting the EP in August 2022.\n\n\n=== 2023–present: I Love You ===\n\nIn March 2023, the band released \"Lights Out\", their first new song since releasing their 2022 EP. \"Never Saw It Coming\" followed as the second single on 7 June, when it was announced that their debut studio album, I Love You, would be released later in 2023. The latter single is the first to be written and sung by van Boxsel, and the band's first acoustic song.\nIn August 2023, founding guitarist Scarlett McKahey announced that due to her struggles with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, she would be unable to continue performing live shows with the band, but she would remain a member for recording.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nThe band cites the Riot grrrl movement as well as the acts of Cherry Glazerr, Dream Wife, VOIID and WAAX as their biggest influences. Ryan, lead songwriter, has said the intention in their lyricism is \"to create music that is relatable and meaningful\" to \"women especially\". The band's lyricism has often alluded to events that have impacted their lives – \"Girl Sports\" is specifically written about a comment made by Stephenson's male dentist to \"stick to girl sports\", and their debut EP's name is derived from remarks made by some listeners' surprise at the band's ability.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\n\nAnna Ryan – lead vocals, rhythm guitar (2015–present)\nScarlett McKahey – lead guitar, backing vocals (2015–present)\nNeve van Boxsel – drums, backing and occasional lead vocals, acoustic guitar (2015–present)\nJaida Stephenson – bass guitar, backing vocals (2015–present)\nCurrent touring musicians\n\nMeg Holland – lead guitar, rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2023–present)\nFormer members\n\nPip Gazard – keyboards (2015–2018)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== AIR Awards ===\nThe Australian Independent Record Awards (commonly known informally as AIR Awards) is an annual awards night to recognise, promote and celebrate the success of Australia's Independent Music sector.\n\n\n=== ARIA Music Awards ===\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual award ceremony event celebrating the Australian music industry. \n\n\n=== APRA Awards ===\nThe APRA Awards are held in Australia and New Zealand by the Australasian Performing Right Association to recognise songwriting skills, sales and airplay performance by its members annually.\n\n\n=== J Awards ===\nThe J Awards are an annual series of Australian music awards that were established by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's youth-focused radio station Triple J.

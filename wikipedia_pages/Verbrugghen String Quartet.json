    "text": "Verbrugghen String Quartet was a string quartet founded by Henri Verbrugghen.\nIn 1903 Verbrugghen founded in Scotland a string quartet. When in 1916 he went to Australia, he took its members with him. All of them were engaged as professors at the New South Wales Conservatorium. They gave numerous chamber music concerts in Sydney, with introductory talks by Verbrugghen.

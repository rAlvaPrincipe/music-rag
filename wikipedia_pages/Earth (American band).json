    "text": "Earth is an American rock band based in Olympia, Washington and led by the guitarist Dylan Carlson. Initially active between 1989 and 1997, their early work is characterized by heavy guitar distortion, drones, and lengthy, minimalist song structures; their 1993 debut album Earth 2 is recognized as a pioneering work of the drone metal genre. The band resurfaced in the early 2000s, with their subsequent output reducing the distortion and incorporating elements of country, jazz rock, and folk. Earth's current lineup consists of Carlson and drummer Adrienne Davies.\n\n\n== History ==\nDylan Carlson founded the band in 1989 along with Slim Moon and Greg Babior, taking the title \"Earth\" from Black Sabbath's prior name. Carlson has remained the core of the band's line-up throughout its changes. At the time of Earth's formation, Carlson was conceptually influenced by minimalist composers such as La Monte Young as well the bands King Crimson and Slayer.\nEarth 2 was described as a \"milestone\" by Terrorizer's Dayal Patterson, which he described as \"a three-track, 75 minute deluge of feedback and distorted guitars that marked the blueprint for what Carlson at the time coined 'ambient metal'\". Carlson was a close friend of Kurt Cobain, who sang lead vocals in the song \"Divine and Bright\", from a demo included on the re-release of the live album Sunn Amps and Smashed Guitars. Because police had twice confiscated guns from Cobain inside a single year, Cobain had Carlson purchase a shotgun for him on March 30, 1994. Cobain told Carlson the gun was for protection. Cobain would use the shotgun to kill himself six days later.The band went on hiatus after the release of Pentastar: In the Style of Demons due to Carlson's personal problems, including heroin addiction, rehabilitation, his connection to Kurt Cobain's death, and incarceration. Carlson attributed the break primarily to his heroin addiction:\n\nAt one point, music was everything to me.  Then suddenly it wasn't and something else was there, and that was something destructive and damaging.  Heroin is part of your life - you don't function without it.  It's not like, \"I need to get it to write,\" it's at a much more fundamental level to your existence, like, \"I need it to get out of bed.\"\nEarth reappeared around 2000 with a markedly different sound. Its music was still drone based, slow-paced, and lengthy, but it now included a drummer and featured strong elements of country music.  Remarking on the stylistic change, Carlson was quick to point to the continuity with Earth's previous sound:\n\nIn 2001 I started writing again.  Originally I had thought it would be something radically different and if it had been I probably wouldn't have stuck with the name.  I thought about doing something different at first, but no matter what I do there's always going to be certain elements that are the same, like the slow tempos and repetition.  So for whatever reason, I can't help myself - it was still Earth.\nThe press release for Hex; Or Printing in the Infernal Method (2005) stated the band's music shows \"the influence of country guitarists/songwriters such as: Duane Eddy, Merle Haggard, Roy Buchanan and fuses it with the vibe of epic visionary composer: Ennio Morricone.\" The press release for The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull (2008) referenced \"the more adventurous San Francisco bands of the late 1960s and 1970s, and the more spiritually aware and exciting forms of Jazz-Rock from the same era\". The press release for Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light I describes \"inspiration from both British Folk-Rock bands the Pentangle and Fairport Convention\".\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent\n\nDylan Carlson – guitar\nAdrienne Davies – drums\nFormer\n\nSlim Moon – vocals\nGreg Babior – guitar\nJoe Preston – bass guitar, percussion\nIan Dickson – guitar, bass guitar\nDave Harwell – bass guitar\nJohn Schuller – bass\nSean McElligot – guitar\nMichael McDaniel – drums\nJonas Haskins – baritone guitar\nSteve \"Stebmo\" Moore – electric piano, trombone, acoustic grand piano, Hammond organ, Wurlitzer electric piano\nLori Goldston – cello\nKarl Blau – bass guitar\nAngelina Baldoz – bass guitar (tour only)\nDon McGreevy – bass guitar\nBill Herzog – bass guitar\nBrett Netson – guitar\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\n\nEarth 2: Special Low-Frequency Version (1993)\nPhase 3: Thrones and Dominions (1995)\nPentastar: In the Style of Demons (1996)\nHex; Or Printing in the Infernal Method (2005)\nThe Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull (2008)\nAngels of Darkness, Demons of Light I (2011)\nAngels of Darkness, Demons of Light II (2012)\nPrimitive and Deadly (2014)\nFull upon Her Burning Lips (2019)\nCollaborations\n\nThe Bug & Earth: Concrete Desert (2017)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ambient music artists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

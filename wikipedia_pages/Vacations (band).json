    "text": "Vacations is an Australian indie rock band formed in 2015 in Newcastle. The group consists of lead songwriter and vocalist Campbell Burns, bassist Jake Johnson, lead guitarist Nate Delizzotti and drummer Joseph Van Lier. They describe their sound as \"woozy guitar pop\", combining indie pop with elements of jangle and lo-fi. After releasing two extended plays, Days in 2015 and Vibes in 2016, they released their debut studio album Changes in 2018, followed by Forever in Bloom in 2020 and, most recently, No Place Like Home on 12 January 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter leaving high school, Campbell Burns began writing and recording \"sad boy songs\" and posting them to his Tumblr account. His friend Jake Johnson heard the tracks and the two started creating music alongside Nate Delizzotti and Joseph Van Lier, forming Vacations in 2015 and gaining traction on SoundCloud and YouTube. The band recorded and published their first two extended plays (EPs) and first studio album by themselves with no management nor PR.\nIn April 2022, their single \"Young\" from 2016 went viral from a TikTok trend, and was quickly certified gold in the United States, Canada and Poland. It holds over 420 million streams as of June 2023 and \"catapulted\" the band to being one of Australia's most-played artists on Spotify. From September to November 2023, Vacations embarked on a 30-date co-headlining tour of North America with fellow Australian indie rock band Last Dinosaurs.\nIn mid-2023, Burns moved to Los Angeles, saying that \"[t]here's a lot more going on in the [United] States for the band right now compared to Australia\". The move– as well as his diagnosis with obsessive–compulsive disorder, inspired the themes of the band's third studio album, No Place Like Home, released in January 2024.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Certified Singles ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== Rolling Stone Australia Awards ===\nThe Rolling Stone Australia Awards are awarded annually by the Australian edition of Rolling Stone magazine for outstanding contributions to popular culture in the previous year.\n\n\n== References =="

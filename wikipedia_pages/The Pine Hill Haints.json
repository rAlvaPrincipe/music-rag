    "text": "The Pine Hill Haints are an American traditional bluegrass/folk/honky tonk/country band from Alabama, though the band members themselves describe their unique southern roots music as \"Alabama Ghost Music.\"\nThe Haints are composed of Jamie Barrier on guitar and vocals,  Katie \"Kat\" Barrier on mandolin, singing saw, and washboard, Stevie LaBlanc on washtub bass, Justin Ward on accordion and trombone, and Brian \"Zero\" Borden on snare drum.\n\n\n== Current line-up ==\nJamie Barrier - vocals, guitar, fiddle, harmonica\nKatie \"Kat\" Barrier – washboard, mandolin, saw\nMatt Bakula - vocals, washtub, tenor banjo\nStevie LaBlanc - washtub, banjo, harmonica\nBrian \"Zero\" Borden - snare\nJustin Ward - accordion, trombone\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nTravis Hightower - washtub\nMatt Bakula - washtub, tenor banjo\nBen Rhyne – snare\nJoey Barrier - banjo\nSarah Nelson - accordion\nRoger Holcombe - snare\nRymodee - saw\nBradley Williams - washtub\nJeremy Dale Henderson- snare\nMatt Comer- snare\nMike Posey - accordion\nJon Lucius - accordion\nJ.R. Collins - snare\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nThe Pine Hill Haints perform music they consider to be \"dead\" in the modern world, hence their self-proclaimed \"Ghost Music.\" Some examples of the genres they perform include (but are not limited to) gospel, rockabilly, rock and roll, celtic music, blues music, and bluegrass. While their catalog of songs comprises mainly original material, the band has also been known to cover traditional gospel (Where The Soul Of Man Never Dies, Where The Roses Never Fade), cowboy (I Ride An Old Paint, Back In The Saddle Again), and folk (Goodnight Irene, Oh! Suzanna/Camptown Races) songs.\nIn addition to their live instruments, the band also utilizes a number of traditional American folk music instruments (such as a fiddle, harmonica, tenor banjo, mandolin, saw, and accordion) on their recordings. Occasionally, members of the Haints will swap instruments or abandon his or her primary instrument altogether, instead performing on one of the aforementioned instruments for a song or two. The band has several former members, and depending on how many happen to be present at a performance, surprise guest performers may accompany the Haints onstage. Such impromptu reunion performances are not completely unexpected at their shows.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nThis Bike Is A Pipe Bomb, J.D.

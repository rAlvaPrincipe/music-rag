    "text": "Dragon Ash (ドラゴンアッシュ, Doragon Asshu) is a Japanese rap rock group founded in 1996 by Kenji \"KJ\" Furuya and Makoto Sakurai. They were one of the first groups to popularize hip hop in Japan.  Dragon Ash is a member of Mob Squad, which is an affiliation with the bands Source and Endive. Dragon Ash uses the French fleur-de-lis as their band logo/symbol.\n\n\n== History ==\nDragon Ash started out as a punk rock group. Lead singer and guitarist Kenji Furuya, son of actor Ikko Furuya, met drummer Makoto Sakurai when they were junior high students in a Tokyo suburb, and the two started playing together. Though temporarily sidetracked into following in his father's footsteps, Furuya gave up the few acting gigs that he was getting on TV dramas to concentrate on music in high school. In 1996, they took on bass player Ikuzo Baba, ten years their senior. The group debuted in 1997 with two EPs at the beginning of the year, The Day Dragged On and Public Garden, influenced by Nirvana. By the end of the year and time of their release, Mustang!, the group had progressed to a blend of various pop and rock influences.\nThrough 1998 their popularity increased, and by the time of Buzz Songs, their sound had solidified to rap rock, helped with the mixing skills of DJ Bots, who occasionally appeared on some songs. Two singles – \"Let Yourself Go, Let Myself Go\" and \"Grateful Days,\" the latter featuring hardcore rapper Zeebra and soulstress ACO – sold so well that they topped the Japanese single and album Oricon charts; also simultaneously, usually reserved for pop music.\nTheir fourth single, \"Let Yourself Go, Let Myself Go\", reached number 7 on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart, and eventually climbed to number 4, selling a total of 640,000 copies. The band simultaneously released their fifth and sixth singles, \"Grateful Days\" and \"I Love Hip Hop\", which debuted at number 3 and number 4, respectively. When these two singles debuted, \"Let Yourself Go, Let Myself Go\" had not yet dropped off the top 10 chart, giving Dragon Ash three top 10 singles at the same time.\nThe band finally reached the peak of their success when they released their third album, Viva la Revolution, in July 1999 and it hit number 1 on its debut week. The album has sold in excess of 2,000,000 copies.\nDuring 1999, Dragon Ash had become a four-piece, with DJ Bots essential to the mix. In 2000, Dragon Ash undertook the Total Music Communication Tour, touring Japan with a lineup that included other rising rock acts, such as Missile Girl Scout, Penpals, and Skebou Kings. Meanwhile, Furuya and DJ Bots formed a duo of sorts, writing and producing songs for acts such as Sugar Soul under the name Steady & Co. Likewise, Baba and Sakurai sidelined as a remixing unit called Motor Headphone, popping up on various compilations. The full band released Lily of da Valley in 2001.\nDragon Ash collaborated with the hip hop group Rappagariya on \"Deep Impact\" in 2000. In 2003 the group expanded to include its full current roster of members, bringing in Hiroki, Atsushi, and Dri-V.

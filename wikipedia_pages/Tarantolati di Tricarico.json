    "text": "Tarantolati di Tricarico are a group of Lucanian folk music.\nThe group was founded in 1975 by Antonio Infantino, with early performances in the Rome music club Folkstudio, run by Giancarlo Cesaroni. Their lyrics in  Lucanian dialect showcase the Tricarico tradition: the drums, the holy water font and the wine fiasco. Popular and pagan celebrations with the rhythm of the tamburo highlight denunciations against poverty and daily injustices to the peasant population.\nOver the course of their career, Tarantolati di Tricarico have participated in national and international festivals such as the De Andrè prize in Rome, Rock Against Racism in Brussels in 1978, WOMEX held in Copenhagen and the Jova Beach Party organized in Praia a Mare and Policoro in 2019. Other performances have been held in Brazil with the Rio Samba School, in Uruguay with Beth Carvalho, in Russia, the United States and Romania.\nSome of Tarantolati di Tricarico's songs were featured in the film soundtrack to Mario Monicelli's The Roses of the Desert (\"Le rose del deserto\") and to the multimedia piece Magna Grecia: Il mito delle origini by Emir Kusturica. A hymn was composed for the Matera \"2019 European Culture Capital\" based on a text by the Materan poet Roberto Linzalone and performed at the 2015 Milan Expo.\nThe group is also a non-profit organization, I Tarantolati del Gruppo di Tricarico, formed in 1999.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Founding members ===\nFranco Ferri – surdo and vocals\nRocco Paradiso – cupa cupa and vocals\nMarcello Semisa – percussion\nPino Molinari – percussion\n\n\n=== Collaborators ===\nMaria Anna Nolè – background vocals and dance\nGianluca Sanza – bass and vocals\nViviana Fatigante – vocals\nEnzo Granella – vocals and guitar\nGiorgio Pavan – mandocello and guitars\nPierluigi Delle Noci – drum set\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Antonio Infantino ed il Gruppo di Tricarico ===\n1975 – I Tarantolati (Folkstudio)\n1976 – La Morte Bianca – Tarantata dell'Italsider (Folkstudio)\n\n\n=== Antonio Infantino and Tarantolati di Tricarico ===\n1978 – Follie del Divino Spirito Santo (Fonit Cetra)\n1996 – Tarantella Tarantata (Amiata Records)\n\n\n=== Tarantolati di Tricarico ===\n2000 – Andamenare (Look Studio / CNI)\n2006 – U Squatasce (Look Studio / CNI)\n2008 – Abballam (Look Studio / CNI)\n2015 – Sciam Sciam – Quaranta di Taranta (Icompany)\n2016 – Terra che trema (Look Studio / CNI)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntonio Infantino\nBasilicata\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nOfficial YouTube page\nLast.fm\nTarantoli di Tricarico on AllMusic\nTarantoli di Tricarico on Genius.com"

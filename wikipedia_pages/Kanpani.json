    "text": "Kanpani (関パニ) is a Japanese TV game show where members of the group Kanjani8 tackled different tasks assigned by the unseen president of the company. The show aired every Wednesday on TV Asahi from 01:36 AM to 01:51 AM from 7 October 2009 to 31 March 2010.\n\n\n== The show ==\nTo open each episode, the narrator states that due to the horrible economic situation, a show production team with very low budget seeks help from seven of their ADs, aka the members of Kanjani8. The ADs are to complete the tasks passed down from their president, of the company named KANPANI.\nOn the official website for the show as well as at the beginning of every episode, the message below is also shown:\n\n    KANPANI is the abbreviation of the KANJANI COMPANY, a television production office that specializes in image and music. Everyone of us makes good use of their physical strength, intellect and acting talents to conduct independent inquiry and data gathering. We promptly transmit helpful information and survey results to the society, which you can use even from tomorrow. Moreover, we produce musical program ID, which will meet viewers' needs widely without being caught in a mere entertainment program production. Hereafter, we \"KANPANI\" will produce the new sensed entertainment program that everybody from kids to adults can enjoy, to make you audience happier.\nThe truthfulness behind these words remain unknown, but the lack of a background on the set of the show seems to verify the statement claiming a slow budget.\nThe show then begins by stating the task or challenge of the day, which is said to be given by the unseen president. All members must then participate in achieving the goal. \nSo far, none of the tasks had been completed.\nAfter the game, a fax is received on the set, with a verdict from the president stating the name and possibly reasons of the member(s) receiving the punishment for the team failure.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nKanjani8 (hosts)\n(You Yokoyama | Subaru Shibutani | Shingo Murakami | Ryuhei Maruyama | Shota Yasuda | Ryo Nishikido | Tadayoshi Okura)\n\nNakamiti Mihoko (Narrator)\n\n\n== Broadcasting details ==\n\n\n== Tasks/challenges ==\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe opening, ending, and in-between music segments are created and performed live by Kanjani8.\nBackground music for the show comes from Kanjani8's previously released music numbers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKanpani Official website (Japanese)"

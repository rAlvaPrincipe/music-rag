    "text": "The Danish Radio Big Band (aka DR Big Band), often referred to as the Radioens Big Band is a radio ensemble and big band founded in Copenhagen in 1964 at the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR).\n\n\n== Band history ==\nOriginally called the New Radio Dance Orchestra, in the early years the band was led by Ib Glindemann. But over the next few decades many new faces joined, such as Chris Potter, Thad Jones, Bob Brookmeyer, Jim McNeely, and guest soloists like Miles Davis, Stan Getz, and Joe Henderson.\nThe band is one of the premiere large jazz ensembles in Denmark, the Danish Radio Big Band (aka DR Big Band) is a dynamic ensemble with a sophisticated approach to post-bop jazz and swing. Although a spotlight organization in their own right with a roster of top Danish musicians, they have built a strong reputation for their many collaborations and recordings with world-renowned jazz soloists. Founded as the New Radio Dance Orchestra in 1964 by bandleader Ib Glindemann, the DR Big Band was initially an outgrowth of the then-Danish Broadcasting Corporation Danmarks Radio's desire to represent jazz in the country and over the airwaves. Since 2009, the band has been based out of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation's Copenhagen complex DR Byen, or \"DR City,\" along with several other nationally funded arts ensembles.\nAs a recording outfit, the DR Big Band debuted in 1970 with Brownsville Trolley, which featured the band led by saxophonist/composer Ray Pitts and trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg. However, the band's output increased throughout the decade under the leadership of famed trumpeter Thad Jones, who had relocated to Copenhagen. During this period, they delivered such well-regarded albums as 1978's By Jones, I think we've got it, and 1979's A good time was had by all. There were also numerous live performances during the band's first three decades, including dates with such luminaries as Stan Kenton, Dizzy Gillespie, Clark Terry, Jimmy Heath, Freddie Hubbard, and many more.\nMore albums followed in the '90s and found the band starting to showcase artists like saxophonist and guest conductor Ernie Wilkins (Suite for Jazz Band) and Danish saxophonist Jesper Thilo. They also released albums paying homage to the music of Jones and Duke Ellington. This trend of showcasing an artist and their work continued over the next decade as the band played with such luminaries as Thomas Clausen, Toots Thielemans, Renee Rosnes, Eivor Palsdottir, Jim McNeely, and others.\nIn 2009, they paired with longtime Wynton Marsalis drummer Jeff \"Tain\" Watts for Impaler, followed a year later by Chromazone with guitarist Mike Stern. Similarly, trumpeter Randy Brecker was the focus of 2011's The Jazz Ballad Song Book. Also that year, lauded saxophonist Chris Potter joined the group for Transatlantic. More albums followed, including works with Richard Bona, Vincent Nilsson, and the band's own trumpeter Gerard Presencer (Groove Travels). Vocalist Curtis Stigers collaborated with the ensemble for his 2017 Frank Sinatra salute One More for the Road. That same year, they delivered the live album Charlie Watts Meets the Danish Radio Big Band, which showcased a 2010 performance with the iconic Rolling Stones drummer.\n\n\n== Band ==\nMembers\n\n\n=== Former members ===\n\n\n== Chief conductors ==\nIb Glindemann (1964–1968)\nVarious guest conductors, including Oliver Nelson, Frank Foster, Robert Cornford, Jimmy Heath, Clark Terry, Mary Lou Williams, Michael Gibbs and Mike Westbrook\nRay Pitts (1971–1973)\nPalle Mikkelborg (1976–1977 & 1981–1982)\nThad Jones (1977–1978)\nOle Kock Hansen (1986–1995)\nBob Brookmeyer (1996–1997)\nJim McNeely (1998–2002)\nMiho Hazama (2019– present)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== As leader/co-leader ===\nBrownsville Trolley Line (Sonet, 1970) – rec. 1969. conducted by Ray Pitts and Palle Mikkelborg.\nBy Jones, I think we've got it (Metronome/Atlantic, 1978) – recorded live at Jazzhus Montmartre, Copenhagen. conducted by Thad Jones.\nA good time was had by all (Metronome/Storyville, 1979) – recorded live at Jazzhus Montmartre, Copenhagen in 1978. conducted by Thad Jones.\nCrackdown: First U.K. Tour (Hep, 1988) – recorded live at Glasgow and York in 1987\nNordjazz Big 5 (Odin, 1991) – conducted by Ole Koch Hansen\nSuite for Jazz Band with guest conductor Ernie Wilkins (Hep, 1992) – rec. 1991\nAmbiance with Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen (Dacapo, 1994) – rec. 1993\nA Little Bit of Duke featuring Jesper Thilo (Dacapo, 1995) – rec. 1994. compositions of Duke Ellington.\nDanish Radio Big Band Plays Thad Jones (Dacapo, 1996) – rec. 1994. compositions of Thad Jones.\nThis Train (Dacapo, 1997)\nWays of Seeing (Storyville, 1999) – rec. 1997\nNice Work with Jim McNeely (Dacapo, 2000) – rec. 1998\nThe Power and the Glory: A salute to Louis Armstrong with Jim McNeely featuring Leroy Jones (Storyville, 2001) – compositions of Louis Armstrong\nRenee Rosnes and the Danish Radio Big Band with Renee Rosnes (Blue Note, 2003) – rec. 2001. conducted by Jim McNeely.\nLady Be Good with Etta Cameron (Content/DR/CMC, 2004) – rec. 2003. conducted by Nikolaj Bentzon.\nCuban Flavour (Cope, 2004)\nTrøllabundin with Eivør Pálsdóttir (Cope, 2005) – rec. 2004–05. conducted by Jesper Riis.\nDansk Stereo (Cope, 2005)\nDedication Suite with Jim McNeely (Cape, 2006) – rec. 2002\nThe James Bond Classics featuring Szhirley (EMI/Red Dot, 2008)\nJazz Divas of Scandinavia with Caecilie Norby, Silje Nergaard, Rigmor Gustafsson (Red Dot, 2009)\nCirkus Summarum (EMI/Red Dot, 2009)\nMerry Christmas, Baby with Sinne Eeg, Bobo Moreno (EMI/Red Dot, 2009)\nImpressions of a West Side Story (EMI/Red Dot, 2009)\nThe Music of Jacob Gade (EMI/Red Dot, 2009) – compositions of Jacob Gade\nThe Impaler featuring Jeff \"Tain\" Watts (Red Dot, 2010) – rec. 2009\nThe Phoenix with Vince Mendoza (Red Dot, 2010)\nCirkus Summarum 2010 (EMI/Red Dot, 2010)\nChromazone featuring Mike Stern (Red Dot, 2010)\nPlay Bill Evans with Jim McNeely (Stunt, 2012) – compositions of Bill Evans. rec. 2000.\nThe Danish Radio Jazz Group With Bent Jædig – 1964 - 1966 (Jazzhus Disk, 2012)\nSpirituals (Storyville, 2014) – conducted by Vincent Nilsson\nJazzin' Around Christmas (Storyville, 2016) – conducted by Dennis Mackrel\nAt the Heart of a Selkie with Eivør, Peter Jensen (Tutl, 2016) – also with the Danish National Vocal Ensemble\nGerard Presencer featuring DR Big Band, Groove Travels (Edition, 2016) – rec. 2015\nCharlie Watts Meets The Danish Radio Big Band with Charlie Watts (Impulse!, 2017) – rec. 2010\nThe Beast with Mathias Heise (Giant Sheep Music, 2018)\nLight Through Leaves with Peter Jensen, Morten Büchert (ILK Music, 2021)\nMiho Hazama featuring DR Big Band, Imaginary Visions (Edition, 2021)\nTale of Time with Annisette (South Harbour, 2022) – rec. 2020\n\n\n=== As guest ===\nBengt-Arne Wallin, The Unexpected Symphony (Sonet, 1979) – rec. 1977\nIb Glindemann, Talk of the Town (Olufsen, 1992) – rec. 1988\nGeorgie Fame, Endangered Species (Music Mecca, 1993)\nMarie Bergman, But Beautiful (Stunt, 1994) – conducted by Ole Kock Hansen\nEliane Elias, Impulsive!

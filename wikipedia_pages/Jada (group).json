Jada was signed by Universal Motown Records president Sylvia Rhone in October 2006. Jada won \"Outstanding Pop/R&B Music Act of the Year\" at the 2008 Boston Music Awards. Jada is managed by Laura Poulin Management/ Bristol Entertainment. Through Universal Motown, Jada released their first major label single, \"American Cowboy\" (written and produced by Akon and RedOne) in the spring of 2009. This was followed by their second major label single, \"Break Up Song\" (written and produced by Wayne Wilkins, Andrew Frampton, and Savan Kotecha) in the fall of 2009. Jada's song \"Model That\" was featured on the November 17, 2009, episode of the MTV television show The City. \"American Cowboy\" was featured on the Fox drama House on Monday, April 27, 2009.  They released a song and music video for \"This Party's on Fire\" (written and produced by Rio, video directed by Vassili Shields) on October 4, 2011. Their most recent EP, named Supersonique, was released on January 24, 2011, and included 5 songs with 2 remixes, including \"Supersonique\", \"This Party's on Fire\", \"Mercy Killing\", \"Can't Let Go\", and \"Goodbye\".\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nJada has now disbanded.\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nIn January 2006, Jada worked in New York with Grammy-nominated producer/songwriter Toby Gad (Fergie, Beyonc√©, Natasha Bedingfield). Jada worked with Gad to co-write the ballad, \"Is It Love\". Jada traveled to studios all over the country, from New York City and Atlanta to Miami and Los Angeles, collaborating with such superstars as RedOne, Akon, Danja, Wyclef Jean, Swizz Beatz and J.R. Rotem.  They also worked with Jordan Omley from production/songwriting team The Jam (production team) (Leona Lewis, Jennifer Hudson, Jordin Sparks) yielded \"The Problem with Love\", \"If You Wanna\" (written by Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic)\" and the inspirational \"Hold On\". An alliance with UK team Wayne Wilkins, Andrew Frampton, and Savan Kotecha (Natasha Bedingfield, Carrie Underwood) resulted in the mid tempo \"Break Up Song\" and club track \"Play a Playa\", while New York City hit-makers Sturken & Rodgers (Christina Aguilera, Rihanna) contributed the ballad, \"Shattered\".  Later, \"Can't Let Go\" was co-written by Jada and Ric Poulin. In 2006, the group signed to Universal Motown.\nTheir song \"I'm That Chick\" (produced by JR Rotem) was featured on the Bring It On: In It to Win It mini soundtrack in late 2007. In February 2008, Jada appeared with R&B singer JoJo at the Ultimate Prom event. In 2008, the writing team, The Clutch and producer Danja, wrote and produced a song with Jada called \"Denial\", which they performed live on NECN.\nJada won \"Outstanding Pop/R&B Music Act of the Year\" at the 2008 Boston Music Awards. The Boston Phoenix official dispatch from the 2008 Boston Music Awards said of Jada, \"Being that they're signed to Motown, these local divas had some hype to live up to. And they did; homegirls look hotter in person than in press shots (one even has a little Jess Alba thing going on), and, unlike manufactured hoaxes like Destiny's Child, every last one of them can belt and grind.\"\nIn 2008, Jada worked with producer RedOne (Lady Gaga, Brandy) at Jada's homebase, Bristol Recording Studios in Boston.  The sessions yielded \"Model That\" and the group's debut single, \"American Cowboy\" (co-written and produced by Akon), which was released to iTunes on March 31.  Jada toured many Top 40 radio stations across the country promoting their song and video release of \"American Cowboy\". The video was directed by Ray Kay (Lady Gaga) and released on April 25.  Jada's second single, the mid-tempo \"Break Up Song\", written and produced by Wayne Wilkins, Andrew Frampton, and Savan Kotecha, was released to Top 40 Radio, iTunes and Amazon.com in September 2009.  The same creative team wrote and produced Jada's song \"Model That\", which was featured on the MTV television  show The City on November 17, 2009.

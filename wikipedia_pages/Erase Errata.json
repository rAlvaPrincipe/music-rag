    "text": "Erase Errata was a band from San Francisco, California.\n\n\n== History ==\nErase Errata formed in Oakland, California, in 1999, and quickly earned national attention after the release of their first eponymous 7-inch single, and via tours with electro-riot grrrl band Le Tigre and Japanese noise-rockers Melt Banana.\nThey released their highly acclaimed debut album Other Animals in 2001, followed by At Crystal Palace in 2003, both on the Troubleman Unlimited label.\nAfter founding guitarist Sara Jaffe left Erase Errata in 2004, singer Jenny Hoyston switched to guitar, and the group briefly drafted a vocalist named Archie McKay.  The group eventually settled on a three-piece lineup, with Hoyston handling both guitar and vocal duties, and joined the Kill Rock Stars roster for the 2006 album Nightlife, which was hailed as “a high watermark for political punk music seeking to complicate the function of entertainment and give it an agenda for this century.”\nThe band then released what proved to be their final album, Lost Weekend, on Under the Sun records in 2015. The band broke up amicably after playing two final concerts in Austin, Texas, in October 2015.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nJenny Hoyston - vocals, guitar, trumpet, keyboards\nEllie Erickson - bass\nBianca Sparta - drums\nSara Jaffe - guitar (1999–2004, with sporadic live appearances thereafter)\nArchie McKay - vocals (July–August 2004)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nOther Animals (2001)\nAt Crystal Palace (2003)\nNightlife (2006)\nLost Weekend (2015)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Erase Errata\" (2000) Inconvenient Press\n\"The Structure of Scientific Misconceptions\" (2001) Toyo\n7\" split single with Black Dice (2001) Troubleman\n7\" compilation feat.

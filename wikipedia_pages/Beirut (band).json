    "text": "Beirut is an American band that was originally the solo musical project of Zach Condon. Beirut's music combines elements of indie rock and world music. The band's first performance with the full brass section was in New York, in May 2006, in support of their debut album Gulag Orkestar, though they performed their first show with Condon, Petree, and Collins at the College of Santa Fe earlier that year.\nCondon named the band after Lebanon's capital, because of the city's history of conflict and as a place where cultures collide. Beirut performed in Lebanon for the first time in 2014, at the Byblos International Festival.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nZach Condon was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on February 13, 1986. He grew up in Newport News, Virginia, and Santa Fe. Condon played trumpet in a jazz band as a teenager and cites jazz as a major influence.\nCondon attended Santa Fe High School, until dropping out when he was 17. Work at a cinema showing international films piqued his interest in Fellini arias, Sicilian funeral brass, and Balkan music.\nCondon attended community college for a short period, then traveled to Europe at the age of 17 with his older brother, Ryan. Condon's exploration of world music developed Beirut's melodic sound. Zach's younger brother Ross Condon played in the band Total Slacker.\n\n\n=== Gulag Orkestar ===\nReturning from Europe, Condon enrolled at the University of New Mexico, where he studied Portuguese and photography. Condon recorded most of the material for Gulag Orkestar alone in his bedroom, finishing the album in a studio with Jeremy Barnes (Neutral Milk Hotel, A Hawk and a Hacksaw) and Heather Trost (A Hawk and a Hacksaw), who became early contributors to the band.\nBa Da Bing Records signed Condon on the strength of the recordings. Condon recruited friends to play Gulag Orkestar's first live shows in New York in May 2006.\nBeirut's first music video was for Elephant Gun, directed by Alma Har'el who also directed the band's second video \"Postcards from Italy\". Lon Gisland was the full band's first release in 2007.\nIn a review on Pitchfork, Brandon Stosuy called the album \"an impressive and precocious debut.\"\n\n\n=== The Flying Club Cup ===\nBeirut's second album, The Flying Club Cup, was recorded largely at a makeshift studio in Albuquerque and completed at Arcade Fire's studio in Quebec. The music on the album has a French influence due to Condon's interest in French chanson during its recording. Condon has cited Francophone singers Jacques Brel, Serge Gainsbourg, and Yves Montand as influences. He also expressed interest in French film and culture, claiming this was his original reason for traveling to Europe. The Flying Club Cup was officially released in October 2007. In September 2007 they did a Take-Away Show acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon. The DVD Cheap Magic Inside was shot but quickly sold out; in December 2010, Beirut, Ba Da Bing, and La Blogothèque authorized its dissemination via digital download\nThe Flying Club Cup has a score of 80 on Metacritic, meaning it is received generally favorable reviews.\n\n\n=== March of the Zapotec ===\nOn April 3, 2008, Beirut canceled a previously announced summer European tour. Already in 2006, Beirut canceled the European leg of the tour due in the fall because after two months of the US tour, Condon stated that he was exhausted. Condon explained the cancellations in a post on the official Beirut website, stating that he wanted to put the effort into ensuring that any shows would be \"as good as humanly possible\". In January 2009 the double EP March of the Zapotec/Holland EP was released, containing an official Beirut release based on Condon's recent trip to Oaxaca (March of the Zapotec), and electronic music under the \"Realpeople\" name (Holland).\nOn February 6, 2009 Beirut made their debut television performance in the United States on the Late Show with David Letterman, performing \"A Sunday Smile\".\n\n\n=== The Rip Tide ===\nIn early June 2011, amid touring the United States, Beirut announced that their newest album, The Rip Tide, which had been recorded the previous winter in upstate New York, was to be released on August 30. The band simultaneously released the single  \"East Harlem\" (first recorded on Live at the Music Hall of Williamsburg), with the B-side \"Goshen\". The album was recorded, managed, and released under Condon's own Pompeii Records.\nReviewers and fellow musicians have noted that, unlike the prior albums which drew heavily on foreign music from Mexico, France, the Balkans, etc., this one has shown Beirut with its own, more pop-oriented sound; saying, \"what emerges [on The Rip Tide] is a style that belongs uniquely and distinctly to Beirut, one that has actually been there all along.\" One reviewer noted that \"the Euro influences [of Beirut's previous albums] are still there, but the presiding spirit is old-fashioned American pop.\" This album also differs from Beirut's previous albums in that the music was recorded as a band playing together rather than laying down individual tracks one at a time, though the lyrics were only added by Condon after all the music had been recorded.\n\n\n=== No No No ===\nOn June 1, 2015, Beirut announced their fourth album, No No No, released on September 11, 2015. On the same day, the title track \"No No No\" was released for streaming. The album was recorded following a period of turmoil in Condon's life, facing a divorce and having been admitted into a hospital in Australia for exhaustion following extensive touring. Beirut also announced a tour for the album.\n\n\n=== Gallipoli ===\nOn October 22, 2018, Condon announced Beirut's next album, Gallipoli, released on February 1, 2019. The album is named after the Italian town where Condon wrote the title track. On January 10, 2019, the music video for Beirut's new song \"Landslide\" was released. \nOn February 9, 2019, Beirut appeared on the \"Saturday Sessions\" segment of CBS This Morning's Saturday program, playing selections from \"Gallipoli.\"\nThe inspiration for Gallipoli started with an old Farfisa organ that Condon had shipped to New York from his parents' home in New Mexico. He acquired the organ in high school when a traveling circus left it in the warehouse of his old workplace. The organ had broken keys and functions, but he managed to write most of his first and large parts of his second albums on it.  Condon started writing the first songs of Gallipoli on this organ sometime in late 2016 at his home in Brooklyn. As songwriting progressed to the studio, Gabe Wax (the producer of No No No) was brought in to help usher in the particular sonic qualities of Gallipoli, which consisted of pushing every instrument and sound to its \"near breaking point\" (much as he did years ago with the old, broken Farisa organ), by channeling instruments through broken amplifiers, tape machines and PA systems. Recording commenced in fall 2017, after travels through Europe, at Sudestudio in Guagnano, Italy, with the help of studio owner Stefano Manca. Gallipoli was completed with final vocals, mixing and mastering happening at both Condon's apartment and Vox Ton studios in Berlin, Germany.\n\n\n=== Artifacts ===\nOn October 20, 2021, Beirut announced their next album, Artifacts, to be released January 28, 2022, via the release of the single \"Fisher Island Sound\" on the band's official YouTube channel. The album is a compilation of \"collected EPs, singles, B-sides and early work,\" including a re-release of the Lon Gisland EP. The album was released via Pompeii Records on January 28, 2022.\n\n\n=== Hadsel ===\nOn August 30, 2023, Beirut announced their next album, Hadsel, and released the first single \"So Many Plans\" on the band's official YouTube channel. The album was released via Pompeii Records on November 10, 2023. The album is \"named for the Northern Norwegian island where the performer spent time in 2020\". In a 4/5 star review in The Guardian Hadsel was described by reviewer Dave Simpson as \"a triumphant celebration of life\".\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCondon plays a rotary-valve trumpet and the ukulele as his main instruments. He bought the ukulele as a joke stage prop, but found he liked the sound and was able to play it despite a wrist injury that inhibited him from playing guitar. Condon also plays the piston trumpet, euphonium, mandolin, accordion, various keyboard instruments, and a modified conch shell that appears on The Flying Club Cup.\nLive, Beirut's roster generally consists of:\n\nZach Condon – trumpet/flugelhorn/ukulele/vocals\nNick Petree – drums/percussion/melodica\nPaul Collins – electric bass/upright bass\nKyle Resnick – trumpet\nBen Lanz – trombone/sousaphone/glockenspiel\nAaron Arntz – piano/keyboards\nPast members include:\n\nKristin Ferebee – violin\nJason Poranski – guitar/mandolin/ukulele\nHeather Trost – violin/viola\nJon Natchez – baritone sax/mandolin/glockenspiel/keyboards\nTracy Pratt – trumpet/euphonium/flugelhorn\nGreg Paulus – trumpet\nKelly Pratt – trumpet/French horn/glockenspiel/keyboards\nJared van Fleet – piano\nPerrin Cloutier – accordion/cello\nSharon Van Etten, who contributes vocals to two tracks on The Rip Tide\nThe majority of the members of Beirut have performed live as well as appeared on recorded material.\n\n\n== Side projects ==\n\n\n=== Realpeople ===\nRealpeople is Zach Condon's electronic side-project.

Their eponymous debut album was released on October 12, 2010 on Ba Da Bing records, and has been described as \"a pop version of Beirut\" and freak-folk, with a heavy emphasis on dance beats and sheer energy.\n\n\n=== Pompeii Records ===\nPompeii Records is the record label founded in 2009 by Zach Condon in order to give the band and himself full control over their music. The first recordings released on the label were the band's double EP,  March of the Zapotec/Holland EP.\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\nCondon plays the mandolin, trumpet and ukulele on A Hawk and a Hacksaw's album A Hawk and a Hacksaw and the Hun Hangár Ensemble, and trumpet and ukulele on Alaska in Winter's album Dance Party in the Balkans.

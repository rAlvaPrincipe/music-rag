    "text": "Of Monsters and Men is an Icelandic indie folk/rock band formed in Garðabær in 2010. It consists of lead singer and guitarist Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir, singer and guitarist Ragnar \"Raggi\" Þórhallsson, lead guitarist Brynjar Leifsson, drummer Arnar Rósenkranz Hilmarsson, and bassist Kristján Páll Kristjánsson.\nThe band won the Músíktilraunir in 2010, an annual Battle of the Bands in Iceland. In 2011, Of Monsters and Men released an EP titled Into the Woods. Their 2011 debut album, My Head Is an Animal, reached the No. 1 position in Australia, Iceland, and Ireland, as well as on the US rock and alternative charts, while peaking at No. 6 on the US Billboard 200 album chart, No. 3 in the UK, and top 20 of most European and Canadian charts. Its lead single, \"Little Talks\", was an international success, reaching the top 10 in most music charts in Europe, including No. 1 in Ireland and Iceland, and No. 1 on US Alternative Songs.\nOf Monsters and Men won the 2013 European Border Breakers Awards.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2009–2010: Formation and early work ===\nThe band was formed in 2009, when Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir decided to add additional members to her solo project, Songbird. Of Monsters and Men entered 2010's Músíktilraunir, an annual music competition held in Iceland, as a quartet, with Nanna (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), Brynjar (electric guitar), Raggi (backing vocals, melodica, glockenspiel), and Arnar (backing vocals, melodica, glockenspiel, tambourine). Raggi came up with the band name.\nFollowing Músiktilraunir, the quartet added two more members, Árni (accordion/keys, backing vocals) and Kristján (bass, backing vocals), and continued to tour in Iceland and work on new songs. They were invited to perform at the 2010 Iceland Airwaves festival, and it was there that the Seattle-based radio station KEXP recorded them performing \"Little Talks\", from a living-room session.\n\n\n=== 2011–2013: My Head Is an Animal ===\n\nOf Monsters and Men signed with Record Records in February 2011, for the release of their debut album in Iceland.

At a listening session in February 2015, the band announced that their yet-to-be-named second album would come out later in the year.

It was released on 16 March 2015, along with the tracklist and other details about the upcoming record, titled Beneath the Skin, set to be released on 8 June. The album and single artwork was created by artist Leif Podhajsky.\nIn May 2015, the band issued dates for a tour to promote the record.

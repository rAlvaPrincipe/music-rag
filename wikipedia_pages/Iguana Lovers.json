    "text": "Iguana Lovers is an Argentine rock band that formed in 1990 in west Buenos Aires, Argentina, by Ariel Soriano (guitars and vocals), Ivan Mirabal (guitars)and Javier Accossatto (bass). They are currently playing with Gabriel Diederle (tambourine and machines)  The band continues today as it has since 1990 and released four LP's and nine EP's.\n\n\n== Career overview and sound ==\nThe band took part in the \"sonic movementt popular in Buenos Aires, by shoegaze, bands like The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Stone Roses, Sonic Youth and Ride, and by the first wave of Argentinian post punk bands like Los Pillos. Iguana Lovers' sound was defined by the sound experimentation, sentimental and ethereal vocal melodies, mixed with distorted guitars and creative sounds.\nIguana Lovers have participated in several concerts and festivals invited by artists such as New Order, Ian Brown, Peter Hook, Mark Gardener and Loz Colbert, Inspiral Carpets, The Jesus and Mary Chain and other local and international talent.\n\n\n== History ==\nIguana Lovers released their first album Universe on a small press-run cassette. The band toured the country and South America, also in 1990 they took part of the Sonic Movement.\nIn 1991, with the incorporation of Diego Cid on samplers, an important Buenos Aires DJ of electronic music and acid house, they began to play in different dance clubs. They then recorded Jungla EP, coming out in 1992 and was presented live in Die Schule sponsored by Omar Chaban. The band, which increasingly gained popularity, closed the year with a big concert at the Centro Cultural Recoleta and were credited as the most important new band of the independent Buenos Aires scene.\n\nThey signed with the independent record company, Tripoli Discos, in 1993, and released the single Mar, which had been recorded in 1990 for their first album. In the mid-90s, they spent a few years of not playing, because they were not in agreement with the record producers provided by the record company to record their second album. They decided to leave it unfinished in the studio. In late 1994, after a massive concert in Cemento, they split up over differences in opinion. In 1996 they recorded Sonic Youth track Cotton Crown for the compilation Wave of Kool things (1997). Ariel Soriano meanwhile also recorded with Televidentes band, My Friend Goo for the same compilation. They meet again in 1998, this time without Ariel Soriano, to record The Cure's Fascination Street for the compilation Into The Sea of Cure (1999)\nSince their return in 2001, after a time experimenting with new technologies, they recorded the singles Nuclear Age (2003), Funeral/Cristales, Universo and Brilla (2007), for The Shifty Disco Singles Club, Oxford, Clash (2009), Virgen (2009), Surfer de Padua (2010) and Colonias Espaciales (2013), the EPs Iguana Lovers (2005), Creí (2007), International Mistery Man (2010) and Ilusión (2013) and the LPs Esencial (2008), which is the album of the year, Psicoclash (2011) and Surfing Caos (2014). Also they continued performing live at several festivals and clubs in Argentina including those memorable shows with New Order (last concert with the original line up with Peter Hook) (2006), with Ian Brown of The Stone Roses (2006) and with a solo Peter Hook (2006).

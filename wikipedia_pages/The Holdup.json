Their music incorporates elements of reggae, hip-hop, pop, and indie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation (2006–2007) ===\nThe Holdup formed initially when drummer Danny Flores and guitarist Tyler Scurti added vocalist Mike Garmany in the autumn of 2006. A second lineup was formed by Danny Flores (drums), Tyler Scurti (guitar), and Mike Garmany (lead vocals/guitar) in 2007 after recruiting Kyle Christensen (bass guitar).\nWhen the band began performing their original songs at local venues around San Jose, a fan base developed for their multi-genre music.

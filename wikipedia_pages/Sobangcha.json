Former member Dun-woo left the group in 1990. Sobangcha was one of the earliest Kpop groups and served as a prototype for later groups which were influenced by its style.\nThe group debuted in 1987 with \"Tell Her\".\nIn 1988, after recording the title song of the 2nd album, 《On the Phone》, Lee Sang-won worked for two weeks and then withdrew.\nThey disbanded in 1990 after the best album.\nAfter regrouping as original members in 1994, G Cafe was announced.\nThey completely disbanded in 1996 after the fifth album.\nThey re-formed in 2005 with two members.\nIn 2012, Jeong Won-gwan was re-recruited.

In particular, \"On the Phone Call\", which was included in the second album in 1988 and received great popularity, was made by almost borrowing the composition and progression of the song from \"Diamond Eyes\" released by Boys' Generation in 1986, and even the costumes and dance were taken as it is, showing the show business at the time. You can see the dark side of the Korean music scene, where the nascent Korean music scene was born. The title of the 4th album released in 1995, G Cafe. This song was nominated for first place in a music pro and received a lot of love.\n\n\n== References =="

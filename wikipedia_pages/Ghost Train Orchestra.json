    "text": "Ghost Train Orchestra is a Brooklyn-based jazz and chamber ensemble led by Boston-based musician Brian Carpenter. The band formed in 2006 when an historic theater in Boston commissioned Carpenter as musical director for its 90th year celebration. For the commission, Carpenter transcribed and arranged a set of overlooked music from late 1920s Chicago and Harlem and formed a side project from his regular band Beat Circus to perform it. The following year the group started performing under the name Ghost Train Orchestra.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nThe band first recorded in 2009 at Avatar Studios in Manhattan and released Hothouse Stomp in 2011 on Accurate Records. The album featured Carpenter's rearrangements and often avant-garde treatments of early jazz from the 1920s and 1930s, drawn from recordings by such artists as Tiny Parham, Charlie Johnson, Fess Williams, and McKinney's Cotton Pickers.\nGTO's 2013 album, Book of Rhapsodies, featured chamber-jazz works from the 1930s and '40s culled from found 78s and rediscoveries by music historians and collectors such as Mitchell Kaba and Irwin Chusid. The album included compositions by Raymond Scott, Reginald Foresythe, John Kirby, and Alec Wilder.\nGTO's next album, Hot Town, issued in 2015, contained more arrangements and reimaginings by Carpenter of 1920s and '30s vintage jazz. Book of Rhapsodies Vol. II, issued in 2017, featured more works by Scott, Foresythe, and Wilder.\nIn 2023, GTO collaborated with Kronos Quartet on the album Songs and Symphoniques: The Music of Moondog. In April 2024, GTO performed the album's repertoire with Kronos Quartet live at New York's Town Hall, with guest vocals by David Byrne, Karen Mantler, and others.\n\n\n== Members ==\nNote: Personnel has changed from project to project\n\nBrian Carpenter – trumpet, harmonica, musical director\nCurtis Hasselbring – trombone\nRon Caswell – tuba\nAndy Laster – alto saxophone\nMatt Bauder – tenor saxophone, clarinet\nDennis Lichtman – clarinet\nMazz Swift – violin, vocals\nEmily Bookwalter – viola\nAvi Bortnick – guitar\nBrandon Seabrook – guitar, banjo\nMichael Bates – double bass\nChris Lightcap - double bass, electric bass\nDavid Cossin - marimba, percussion\nRob Garcia – drums\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHothouse Stomp (2011) - Music from late 1920s Chicago and Harlem\nBook of Rhapsodies (2013) - Carpenter's reimagining of chamber jazz from the late 1930s\nHot Town (2015) - More music from late 1920s Chicago and Harlem, with guest Colin Stetson\nBook of Rhapsodies, Vol. II (2017) - More rearrangements of chamber jazz from the late 1930s for orchestra and choir\nSongs and Symphoniques: The Music of Moondog (2023) - Collaboration with Kronos Quartet reimagining the music of Louis Hardin aka Moondog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHomepage of the orchestra"

    "text": "Boytronic is a German music group that plays electropop. It was founded in 1983 by Holger Wobker and Peter Sawatzki in Hamburg, Germany as Kapitän Sehnsucht (Captain Desire). The original Boytronic released two synthpop albums: The Working Model (1983) and The Continental (1985). The record company, claiming rights to the band name, put together a completely different line-up in 1986. It was headed by Hayo Lewerentz (Hayo Panarinfo) (U96/Major Records) and continued to record under the Boytronic name until the mid-1990s. In 2002, Boytronic was revived by Wobker from the original group and Panarinfo from the second incarnation. They released the albums Autotunes, Maxi and remastered editions of The Working Model (Reverse) and The Continental (Replace) with bonus tracks. The albums were released on Hayo Lewerentz label Major Records.\nWobker teamed up with his Beachhead bandmate Hans Johm (Antlers Mulm) and Michael Maria Ziffels for the Dependence (2006) album. On this album the song \"Forever\" from The Continental album, sees its German version as \"Für Immer\".\nThe band had three charting singles in Germany. In a 1986 NME interview, Curtis Mantronik said that he had adopted his pseudonym, and the name Mantronix, from an imported recording by this group.\n\n\n== Group members ==\n\n\n=== 1982–1985 ===\nBryllyant Berger (aka Holger Wobker)\nPeter Sawatzki-Bär\nKlaus Stockhausen\nCharly Schöppner (had his own band as well: \"Electric Theatre\")\nKlaus Dufke\n\n\n=== 1986–1987 ===\nHayo Lewerentz (Hayo Panarinfo)\nBela Lagonda\n\n\n=== 1987–1993 ===\nMark Wade\nAlberto Hauss (aka Bela Lagonda)\nHayo Lewerentz\n\n\n=== 1994–1995 ===\nHayo Panarinfo\nBela Lagonda\n\n\n=== 2002–2005 ===\nHolger Wobker\nHayo Panarinfo\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\nHolger Wobker\nHans Johm (Antlers Mulm)\nMichael Maria Ziffels\n\n\n=== 2017 ===\nHayo Lewerentz\nAlberto Ingo Hauss\nJames Knights\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\nHolger Wobker\nJames Knights\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Boytronic discovery ===\n\n\n==== Albums ====\nThe Working Model (1983)\nThe Continental (1985)\nLove for Sale (1988)\nThe Heart And The Machine (1992)\nAutotunes (2002)\nDependence (November 2006)\nJewel (2017)\nThe Robot Treatment (2019)\n\n\n==== Remix albums ====\nBoyzclub Remixes (1991)\nThe Robot The Robot Treatment (Remix Pack Piece Of Entertainment And Dancing Wild For You) (2020) \n\n\n==== Re-released albums ====\nThe Working Model – Reverse (bonus tracks) (2003)\nThe Continental (The Replace - bonus tracks) (2005)\n\n\n==== Unreleased albums ====\nBlueberry Pancake With Maple Syrup (unreleased) (1986)\nA Feather on the Breath of God (unreleased) (1995)\n\n\n==== Compilations ====\nMaxi (2004)\nThe Original Maxi-Singles Collection (2014) \nThe Drama Compilation \n\n\n==== Singles Boytronic ====\nYou (1983) GER No. 10\nDiamonds And Loving Arms (1984)\nYou (US release) (1984)\nMan In A Uniform (1984)\nHold On (1984)\nLate Night Satellite (1985)\nHurts (1986)\nYou ('86 release) (1986)\nBryllyant (1986)\nI Will Survive (1988)\nTears (1988)\nDon't Let me Down (1988) GER No. 45\nTrigger Track '89 (1989)\nHold On ('91 release) (1991)\nYou ('91 release) (1991)\nPictures Of You (1992)\nMy Baby Lost Her Way (1992)\nSend Me An Angel (1994) GER No. 95\nBlue Velvet (1995)\nLiving Without You 1 (2002)\nLiving Without You 2 (2002)\nTime After Midnight (2017)\nAll You Can Eat (2019)\n\n\n=== As KAMERATA - Holger Wobker, Ralf Martens ===\n\n\n==== Album ====\nLovers & Other Strangers (1988)\n\n\n==== Singles ====\nCharlotte (1987)\nHeroin (1987)\nHorseback (1988)\n\n\n=== As BEACHHEAD- Holger Wobker, Hans Johm ===\nDrowning Tonight (2006)\n\n\n== See also ==\nU96\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nBoytronic discography at Discogs \nBoytronic biography"

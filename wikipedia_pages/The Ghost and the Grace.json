    "text": "The Ghost and The Grace was an American indie folk project for Daniel Anderson. The live band consisted of singer-songwriter Daniel Anderson along with several other rotating musicians from the Bellingham, Washington music scene.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was conceived by Anderson during a tour with Drop Dead, Gorgeous, during which he was overwhelmed by playing with metal and hardcore bands and decided to create an outlet for other genres of music.\nThe debut album, Behold! A Pale Horse, was released on July 6, 2009, through the band's website. The choice to release the record without a label was \"a kind of experiment\" by Anderson so test if an artist could create and distribute an album completely independently .\nThe Ghost and the Grace released the first installment of holiday music on November 26, 2009, entitled Holiday Spirit Vol. 1 on its website, either free of charge or donations towards the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.\nOn June 29, 2010, The Ghost and The Grace announced the title of their new record Rat King on their website. Later in the year Anderson eventually dropped all work on the album in favor of his new project Glowbug.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBehold!

    "text": "Okoumé was a Quebec based folk-rock band from 1995 to 2002. The group was formed in 1995 and originally consisted only of founding members Jonathan Painchaud, Éloi Painchaud, Michael Duguay, Hugo Perreault, and Éric Gosselin.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group formed in 1995 received the first prize in French Canadian radio station CKOI-FM's  \"Le concours Pro-Scène\" (\"Pro-Scene Contest\"), which yielded them one hundred hours in a recording studio. They were also the opening act for noted French Canadian singer-songwriter Kevin Parent.\nTheir eponymous first album was released in 1997. Four tracks from the album (Dis-moi pas ça, La lune pleure, Le bruit des origines, and La mer à boire) placed in weekly Top Ten rankings, with Le bruit des origines ranking at number in CKOI-FM's Top 50 of 1998 and La mer à boire ranking at number 24 the following year. The band went on tour to support these releases.\nOkoumé released their second album, Plan B, in 2000.  The album failed to capture the interest of the public, so the group decided to disband in 2002.\nThe band reformed for a reunion show in 2014, as part of Montreal's  Coup de coeur francophone festival.\n\n\n== Members ==\nMichel Duguay - bass\nÉric Gosselin  - drums, percussion\nFrédéric Lebrasseur - percussion (1995 only)\nÉloi Painchaud - backing vocals, guitar, harmonica, flute\nJonathan Painchaud - lead vocals, acoustic guitar\nPatrice Painchaud - violin, keyboards (occasional appearances only)\nHugo Perreault - backing vocals, guitars, dulcimer, lap steel guitar, mandolin\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Okoumé (1997) ===\n1.

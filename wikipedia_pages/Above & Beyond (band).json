    "text": "Above & Beyond are an electronic music group consisting of English musicians/DJs Jono Grant, Tony McGuinness and Finnish musician/DJ Paavo Siljamäki. Formed in 2000, they are the owners of London-based electronic dance music labels Anjunabeats and Anjunadeep, and also host a weekly radio show titled Group Therapy Radio. \nThe trio has been consistently ranked among DJ Magazine's Top 100 DJs Poll; coming at their highest position of  No. 4 in 2008,  with their most recent position of No. 53 in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation (1999–2000) ===\nGrant and Siljamäki met at the University of Westminster. Having discovered a common mutual interest for electronic music, they decided to collaborate in writing music together. Following Siljamäki's suggestion, they set up the Anjunabeats label in the summer of 1999 with the release of their first single, \"Volume One\", under the alias Anjunabeats. Initially, the Anjunabeats record label was founded as a medium to release their own music. Since the label acquired the same name as their production alias, however, they started to release music under different names, most notably as Dirt Devils and Free State.\nThe original mix of \"Volume One\", packaged with their Tease Dub Mix, received immediate attention in various dance clubs and quickly gained support from DJs such as Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold, Judge Jules, and Paul van Dyk, after Grant and Paavo Siljamäki personally handed a dub plate of the song to Paul Oakenfold in 2000 at Home, the now-defunct London nightclub.\nFollowing the success of \"Volume One\" and a string of singles and remixes under their Free State and Dirt Devils alter egos, the marketing director & manager of Warner Music Group, Tony McGuinness, was alerted to the duo by his brother, Liam McGuinness. Liam had purchased a sample library that Grant had created for Yamaha and got in touch with Jono. Having been commissioned to remix Chakra's \"Home\", Tony McGuinness recruited Grant and Siljamäki to help him complete the remix. When the group was searching for a name to use for their Chakra remix, the inspiration came from a web page belonging to an American motivational trainer coincidentally named Jono Grant. Grant had the poster stuck to his wall. The slogan used by the motivational trainer was \"Above & Beyond\", and they decided to use that as their name. Although the group was relatively unknown at the time, their remix of Chakra's \"Home\" was picked over remixes by Rob Searle and Tilt to be the A-side mix, and, after plays by Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1, it reached number one in the UK club charts.\nIn addition to Above & Beyond's production work, the trio also established the vocal trance group OceanLab with Justine Suissa. Other collaborators in the band's early stages include Andy Moor and vocalists Carrie Skipper, Ashley Tomberlin, Zoë Johnston, and Richard Bedford.\n\n\n=== Early productions and DJ career debut (2001–2005) ===\n\nInterest in Above & Beyond soon emerged from established trance labels and new remixes were requested: the trio remixed Aurora's \"Ordinary World\", Fragma's \"Everytime You Need Me\", Perpetuous Dreamer's \"The Sound of Goodbye\", and Adamski's \"In the City\". These tracks served as the foundation for Above & Beyond's reputation as one of the UK's leading vocal trance remixers.\nIn 2001, Above & Beyond produced a club mix for Madonna's single \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\", and also remixed select tracks by Delerium, Three Drives, and J-pop artist Ayumi Hamasaki.\nIn 2002, Above & Beyond made their DJ debut in Tokyo performing for 8,000 clubbers alongside Ferry Corsten and Tiësto. As their fan base increased, the trio began to make regular appearances at some of the world's largest music festivals and clubs, including Rockness, Glastonbury and Creamfields in the UK and Amnesia in Ibiza, Spain.\nIn 2003, Above & Beyond remixed DJ Tomcraft's \"Loneliness\", Motorcycle's \"As the Rush Comes\", as well as being asked back by Madonna to remix \"Nobody Knows Me\". Other remixes included Britney Spears' single \"Everytime\", Dido's \"Sand in My Shoes\", and Delerium's \"Silence\".\nAbove & Beyond's single \"No One On Earth\", featuring the vocals of Zoë Johnston, soon followed. The Gabriel & Dresden Remix of this song was voted Tune of the Year for 2004 in Armin van Buuren's trance radio show A State of Trance.\nIn 2004, OceanLab's fourth single, \"Satellite\", was released. Known to be one of their break-through tracks in the early days of producing, it reached No. 19 on the UK chart in May 2004.\n\n\n=== Tri-State era (2006–2009) ===\nIn 2006, Above & Beyond released their debut artist album, Tri-State. UK-based DJ Magazine gave the album a five-star review, saying, \"A blend of sleek electronic rhythms, lush filmic textures and old-fashioned song writing. Tri-State is the fulfillment of any dance act's ultimate album aspiration: a padding-free, skilled, diverse long-player. In a word, 'Brilliant.'\"\nSingles from the album include \"Air for Life\", with Andy Moor, which won Best Underground Dance Track at the 2006 Miami Winter Music Conference and was named Tune of the Year for 2005, as voted by the listeners of Armin van Buuren's radio show A State of Trance. \"Alone Tonight\", featuring Richard Bedford, was nominated for best progressive house/trance track at the 22nd International Dance Music Awards held at the 2007 Miami WMC, reaching No. 4 in the Finland National Singles chart and No. 5 in the UK Dance Chart. Above & Beyond performed \"Alone Tonight\" at the Global Gathering 2005 broadcast live on Radio One in the UK. Their single \"Can't Sleep\" was included on A State of Trance's episode 280, which featured at No. 3 on the best 20 tracks of 2006, according to the fans that voted in its polls. The Above & Beyond Club Mix of their track \"Good for Me\", featuring Zoë Johnston, was also voted Tune of the Year in 2006 on Van Buuren's A State of Trance. In 2008, Above & Beyond won Best Underground Dance Track at the IDMA Awards at the Winter Music Conference with their Above & Beyond Club Mix of their single \"Home\".\nOn 31 December 2007, Above & Beyond unofficially hosted their largest show ever on Barra Beach, Rio de Janeiro, where they reportedly played to an estimated one million people.\nIn 2009, Above & Beyond performed at the official launch of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo. The event took place in the Mojave Desert and was hosted by Sir Richard Branson and attended by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The performance was secured after Above & Beyond's Buzz Aldrin-sampling club track \"Buzz\" was picked by Virgin to soundtrack the unveiling of the spaceship.\n\n\n=== Group Therapy era (2010–2014) ===\n\nThe first single to be heard from Above & Beyond's second artist album, Group Therapy, was \"Thing Called Love\", featuring vocals from Richard Bedford. It is featured in the Anjunabeats Volume 8 compilation album released on 19 July 2010. After months of writing, refining, and perfecting, the hugely anticipated album Group Therapy was released to widespread critical acclaim on 6 June 2011. Hitting No. 1 in the iTunes Dance Album charts, the album was also hugely well received by the dance music press. DJ Magazine put the three members of Above & Beyond on the cover of their May issue, describing them as the \"biggest DJ/production collective the UK has ever produced.\" Mixmag hailed the album as \"Artist Album of the Year\". The album contains downtempo moments, such as the classical piano-influenced opening track \"Filmic\" and the reflective \"Only a Few Things\", featuring Zoë Johnston, as well as more uptempo club tracks such as \"Sun & Moon\", \"Thing Called Love\", and \"Prelude\". All songs are written and produced by Above & Beyond, with Richard Bedford and Zoë Johnston providing vocals.\nThe first official radio single from the album, \"Sun & Moon\", featuring vocals from Richard Bedford, became a favorite of BBC Radio 1 personality Vernon Kay and ended up on the station's B-List, an achievement that was also followed by their second radio single, \"Thing Called Love\", which also featured Richard Bedford. \"Thing Called Love\" was also featured during an episode of the MTV drama Teen Wolf. In 2017, Billboard named \"Sun & Moon\" the number-one saddest dance music song of all-time.\n\nIn 2012, Above & Beyond embarked on its Group Therapy World Tour, performing sold-out shows at select venues and clubs across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The group also made their debut in Hawaii, performing at the Kaka’ako Waterfront Park in Honolulu. In August 2012, Above & Beyond appeared on the cover of Mixmag and performed a live set at Mixmag Headquarters along with Mat Zo. The 2-hour set was subsequently released as an exclusive label showcase mix titled United Colours of Anjunabeats.\nIn 2013, Above & Beyond continued to headline and perform at several dance music festivals, including Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, Electric Forest, Tomorrowland and Stereosonic. The group also performed their first-ever acoustic shows at Porchester Hall in London and The Greek Theater in Los Angeles, featuring Zoë Johnston, Alex Vargas and Annie Drury, among other special guests including Skrillex. On 26 October 2013, Above & Beyond celebrated Episode 050 of Group Therapy Radio (their 500th radio show overall) at Alexandra Palace in London with a live 6-hour broadcast.\nOn 18 October 2014, Above & Beyond celebrated Episode 100 of Group Therapy Radio at Madison Square Garden in New York City with a live broadcast. Ilan Bluestone opened the show, followed by Andrew Bayer and Mat Zo, respectively. Above & Beyond then took the stage and performed a 2-hour set. During the set, they debuted new music from their upcoming album We Are All We Need. The previous day, 17 October, Above & Beyond had debuted the new video for the title track of We Are All We Need in Times Square. They narrowly missed arrest when, after inviting fans to come out and view the video, hundreds turned out in droves. Police on horseback were summoned to the location, as traffic was beginning to become blocked.\n\n\n=== Acoustic, We Are All We Need, and Acoustic II (2014–2016) ===\nFollowing acoustic shows in London and Los Angeles, Above & Beyond premiered the concert film Live From Porchester Hall on 24 January 2014 across the world. Then the album, Acoustic, was released on 28 January 2014. Tony McGuinness wrote:\n\n\"The acoustic project is a reconnection with the musicians that we were before we met ... the songs have been on an interesting journey to get here because we tend to write in a fairly acoustic way anyway. We don't just stick a bit of vocal over a dance track – that's not how we work. We try to start with a song and it's usually only later down the line that we take certain elements from that song and progress them into a more dancefloor-friendly version.\"\nA special edition of Acoustic was also released, containing a DVD of the concert film in London, a photographic journal, and signed commentary from all members of the band. A limited press double vinyl edition was later released on 17 March 2014.\nDuring their acoustic shows at Porchester Hall, Above & Beyond announced that their third artist album would be released sometime in 2014. Vocalists Alex Vargas and Justine Suissa have been confirmed as collaborators on new material.\nOn 14 October 2014, Above & Beyond announced their third studio album, We Are All We Need, which was released on 19 January 2015 (20 January 2015 in the US & Canada).\nOn 26 September 2015, the group announced that a second acoustic album, Acoustic II, would be released on 3 June 2016. A world tour with dates across Europe, North America, and Australia was scheduled in support of the new material. The tour featured artists Zoë Johnston, Justine Suissa, Cobi, and Natalie Holmes.\n\n\n=== Common Ground and Flow State (2017–present) ===\nOn 4 August 2017, Above & Beyond released the single \"Tightrope\" featuring Marty Longstaff. Then on 8 September 2017, Above & Beyond released the single \"My Own Hymn\" featuring long-time collaborator Zoë Johnston. On 3 November 2017, the single \"Northern Soul\" was released, becoming the first Above & Beyond single to feature Richard Bedford on vocals since \"Black Room Boy\" in 2013. On 19 January 2018, the trio released the single \"Always\", which is a piano-driven ballad featuring Zoë Johnston. A music video which features the artists performing the single on top of a French Alps mountain was released together on the same day.\nThe album Common Ground was released on 26 January 2018 through Anjunabeats, containing the aforementioned singles \"Tightrope\", \"My Own Hymn\", \"Northern Soul\" and \"Always\".\nOn 15 May 2018, the group released \"Red Rocks\" which was inspired by the Red Rocks Amphitheatre structure in Colorado. Their next single, \"Rocket Science\", was released on 7 September 2018 and was previously debuted in front of 23,000 listeners at their 2017 Gorge Amphitheatre performance. The group wrote in a joint statement that the track began as an experiment trying out a new DAW, which they enjoyed working with.\nIn June 2019, the group announced their fifth album, Flow State, which was released on 19 July 2019, and is an entirely ambient album.\n\n\n== Radio shows ==\nAbove & Beyond produce a weekly show, and have produced several radio shows since 2004, including Anjunabeats Worldwide.

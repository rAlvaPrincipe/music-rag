    "text": "This is an alphabetical list of the basso profondo, bass, bass-baritone and tenor soloists who have performed with the Alexandrov Ensemble (under its various titles) since its establishment in 1928. It is difficult to differentiate between regular and guest soloists, since many have alternated between the one category and the other during their careers, so they are all listed together. Soloists of whom no recordings have yet been found have been listed below as \"other soloists\".\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nUntil April 2009, when this article was created, little or nothing was generally known outside Russia about these fine soloists: as a group, or (in most cases) as individuals. People in the West could read a few of their names on current Alexandrov Ensemble CDs and DVDs, and perhaps hear a few old 78rpm recordings on YouTube, but could not Google in English for their images or musical biographies.  Since April 2009, to a certain extent, they can. Therefore this article is part of the soloists' history.\nIn 2004, Max Loppert said of Georgy Vinogradov: \"How is it possible for any singer of this caliber to have been (outside Russia) this unknown?\". One could say the same of the whole group. Before April 2009, almost all online resources on this subject were in Russian and Japanese, and even these were limited in content, so far as the biographies of most soloists were concerned. The dearth of information in the West could be partly attributable to the language barrier and the Cold War. One could speculate that scandals such as those 1951 rumours surrounding Vinogradov could have pressured the Alexandrov Ensemble to exercise particular discretion regarding publicity of their valuable star turns.\nEven so, there is almost no online information about the tenor Victor Nikitin, who made a beautiful 78 rpm recording of Cold Waves Lapping in the 1940s, and his last traceable recording appears to have been made in 1951, the same year as the rumours of a bar-room brawl and the end of Georgy Vinogradov's career. One can draw no conclusions, but – outside Russia at least – an air of mystery surrounds some of these great singers.\n\n\n=== Status of soloists ===\nApart from guest soloists, there are two ways of contracting a soloist in the Alexandrov Ensemble:\n\nA soloist of the choir is a constant member of the choir and only sometimes has one or two solo performances with certain songs specially selected for their personal vocal capabilities.\nSoloist of the Ensemble is a higher grade, meaning that the singer is a soloist on a constant basis and never – or no longer – takes part in the choir.\n\n\n== A to Z list of soloists ==\n\n\n=== Georgi Abramov ===\nBorn in Moscow 12 April 1903; died in Georgia 1 November 1966 (Russian: Георгий  Абрамов).

The lyric of Nightingale asks the nightingale to be quiet as the soldiers are sleeping; i.e. they have died.  One of his most popular recordings with The Alexandrov Ensemble is Kalinka.\n\n\n=== Pyotr Dmitrievich Bogachev ===\n(Russian: Петр Дмитриевич Богачёв), bass-baritone soloist. Honoured Artist of Russia. With the Alexandrov Ensemble he recorded In the Ocean Gave duet with S. Ivanov (music: B. Korostylev; lyrics: B. Bezhaev), It's a Long Time Since We Were Home duet with S.

In 1944 he graduated from the Gnessin State Musical College, and became a soloist in the Air Force ensemble. It has been suggested in the West that he was overshadowed by E. Belyaev, but Leonid Kharitonov remembers the following:\n\n\"Bukreev didn’t have any specific reaction to Belyaev's success. Actually, he was glad for his colleague. Besides, it would be quite strange to compare them since they were different kinds of tenor – Belyaev was lyric tenor (higher voice) and Bukreev was a lyric and dramatic tenor (deeper voice). Bukreev never performed as a soloist abroad. Belyaev sang only three songs abroad and was mainly famous for the Kalinka song. In Russia they had equal popularity.  Bukreev was teetotal and was a good husband and father to his wife and daughter.\"\nKharitonov only ever sang duets with one person, and that was Bukreev.

His main repertoire was the songs of Soviet composers. From 1942 to 1967 he was a soloist of the All-Union Radio. For 25 years he performed fine duets with the lyric tenor Vladimir Nechaev (1908–1969) whom he had met during World War II.\nWith the Ensemble of the All-Union Radio Committee under Boris Alexandrov he recorded Evening in the Roadstead/Night on the Road duet with P. Mikhailov (recorded 1942).\nThis is a baritone-tenor duet, and the choir includes women sopranos.  He also recorded Nightingale in the 1940s as a baritone-tenor duet with Georgi Pavlovich Vinogradov,\nIt's a Long Time Since We Were Home duet with V. Nechaev.\n\n\n=== E. Burchak ===\n(Russian: Е.Бурчаков), bass-baritone soloist. With the Alexandrov Ensemble he recorded Not a – Do Not Know (music: S. Tulika; lyrics: V.

With the Alexandrov Ensemble he recorded Jet Pilot, Ballad of the Red Army, Loyalty duet (possibly with G. Andryushchenko),\nHail to the Infantry! with V. Shkaptsov (1978) and unknown song.\n\nCritical commentary on a music video featuring Chernykh and Bukreev: They sing The Grey Cuckoo on Soviet Army Chorus and Dance Ensemble This screenshot illustrates the sheer lack of public ego among the tenors of the Ensemble. In the West, a duet or trio of lyric tenors is always something of a competition for audience attention on the part of the singers – but here it is always a matter of humility to the music: blending; complementing; adjusting of the voice for perfect harmony of dynamic and musicality.  The duettists always behave like the army choristers, whom Boris Alexandrov famously described as being so well-disciplined due to regular square-bashing.  This, of course, was a joke as they are clearly as exhaustively rehearsed as any Georg Solti choir. This screenshot shows them not showing off, but simply working.  It helps to illustrate that this army choir was really born of the Kazan Cathedral choir where Alexander Alexandrov learned his trade all those decades ago.  The choir was never a sport of the operatic stage where Boris was trained.\n\n\n=== Ivan Alexandrovich Didenko ===\nIvan Alexandrovich Didenko, soloist of the choir. (Russian: Иван Александрович Диденко); Tenor soloist, (Born 1924 - Died 2008). He joined the Alexandrov Ensemble in 1955 and was active as a soloist until 1982.

Lisyansky), The Birch Tree (1956) Snowflakes (1956) The Hero Chapayev Roamed The Urals, Song of the 27th Division and I have travelled around the entire universe\n\n\n=== Viktor Konstantinovich Dmitriev ===\nViktor Konstantinovich Dmitriev, (Russian: Виктор  Константинович Дмитриев), bass soloist. \nBass singer. Born in 1927. He started out singing with the North Sea Fleet Song and Dance Ensemble, but moved to the Alexandrov Ensemble in October 1958. He was promoted to soloist in 1962 and continued to work until he retired in 1966. Many of his remaining recordings are by Muradeli. In the materials for his 1968 Japan tour (advertisements published in Record Geijutsu and elsewhere), his name is mistakenly listed as \" Vladimir Dmitriev \" (though he is listed correctly on the 1963 recording of Le Chant du Monde in France).\nWith the Alexandrov Ensemble he recorded the beautiful and dramatic Halt, Who Goes There! (music: B. Muradeli; lyrics: E. Dolmatovskaya).\nThe Alarm Bells of Buchenwald in 1963 along with the live concert in 1964. Border Guard Song,  Days of War and I am going\n\n\n=== Arthur Arturovich Eisen ===\n\nArthur Arturovich Eisen (Russian: Артур Артурович Эйзен), bass-baritone soloist. (b. Moscow 8 June 1927; d. Moscow 26 February 2008).

(Russian:Василий Елисеев), tenor with countertenor capability, i.e. with smooth transition to upper range, and good tone and projection throughout. There is a long tradition of countertenors in the Eastern Orthodox Church; this tradition continued during the Soviet era. With the Alexandrov Ensemble he recorded: Listen. On the Kultur video from which the screenshot is taken, Eliseev is incorrectly named as Nicolai A. Abramov.\n\nCritical commentary on a music video featuring Vasily Eliseev\nEliseev sings Listen on the music video Soviet Army Chorus and Dance Ensemble The song, Listen, takes full advantage of Eliseev's countertenor capability.  According to Eliseev's apparent age in the screenshot, he was probably born in the 1920s and spent his early career in World War II: a time of great hardship for the general populace.  Music was a great solace for the troops and the people, and the Alexandrovs felt the need to produce a full range of compositions.  They needed sopranos for their choir and soloists, but were not permitted them.  Eliseev filled a need for a beautiful and highly trained voice, to allow not just extended chords for drama and pathos in the video, but chords to provide a beauty and spiritual dimension in the arrangement of Listen, in which a political prisoner voices his dreams of Outside. Just as the spiritual dimension of the song appears to reach through the music to beyond the studio, so this singer appears to be conscious of a level beyond himself, as seen in the screenshot, and as heard in his ethereal upper register.\n\n\n=== Vladimir Vasilievich Fyodorov ===\n(Russian: Владимир Васильевич Федоров)  The only basso profondo that the Ensemble ever had. \nHe joined the Red Banner Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble in 1938.

It is usually categorised as a folk song as the name of the composer has been lost.  However it is clearly a professional composition of a quality comparative to those of medieval Northern European composers of troubadour songs, such as Dufay and Binchois. This performance is part of the history of the early music revival movement. In the 19th century, rediscovered early music, along with folk music, was usually arranged to be performed in the grand orchestral or Italian operatic style. However, such music had always survived in church music, in one form or another, and people were used to hearing it performed in the style of traditional European church choirs: no vibrato; pure and clear tone; adjusting the voice production to the acoustics of the building.  In church music, the building was always the secondary soundbox for the vocal instrument (the nasal cavity being the first). From the 1950s, early music performance reverted to this ecclesiastical style of singing. So the Alexandrov Ensemble performance of ca.1963 was very modern for its time.  Gres sings like a church choir baritone, with the same appearance of spiritual joy as any oratorio soloist. The screenshot does not capture such a moment, but it does show the sheer effort that the performance required.  His voice is responding to a building-soundbox too; in this case a recording studio.  The Russian practice of the time was to film outdoors and then dub the sound later. Studio dubbing tends to appear artificial today, but on this occasion it is advantageous, as the church choral style does need a building-soundbox. From the 1970s, some early music singers, such as the Martin Best Ensemble, started to reflect what may have been the contemporary late medieval performance-style of troubadour songs: that is, the Arab singing style which can still be heard in Islamic sung prayer. Hence Gres' performance now sounds a little dated, but remains nonetheless one of the finest recorded performances of this song.\n\n\n=== Sergei Vasilievich Ivanov ===\n(Russian: Сергей Васильевич Иванов), tenor soloist. Honoured Artist of Russia. With the Alexandrov Ensemble he recorded In the Ocean Gave duet with P. Bogachev (music: B. Korostylev; lyrics: B. Bezhaev), It's a Long Time Since We Were Home duet with P. Bogachev (music: V.Solovev-Sedoy; lyrics: A. Fatyanov), We, the Army People duet with P. Bogachev (music: G.

Shaferan), Your Soldiers duet with P. Bogachev (music: B. Gamal; lyrics: A. Sofronov), Smuglianka, duet with P. Bogachev (music: A. Novikov; lyrics: Y. Chvedov)\n,\nThe Samovars duet with P. Bogachev (music A. Novikov; lyrics: S. Alimov) (1982/92)\n,\nEndless Sea duet with P. Bogachev, The Hero Walks in the Urals solo (1983), Who Protects the Country duet with P. Bogachev, Afield duet with P. Bogachev (1992), Nut Brown Girl duet with P. Bogachev (1989/92, 2003), Evening on the Roads duet with P. Bochachev 1992, Distant Northern Town trio with S.V.

Bogachev (1984).\n\nCritical commentary on a music video featuring Ivanov and Bogachev (see screenshot left): They sing Smuglianka in the DVD Silva America, The Alexandrov Red Army Choir Orchestra – Live in Paris. This performance displays the modern aspect of the Ensemble: performers who are still very much part of the choir, and who still sing in the traditional soldierly, undramatic style, but who are now free to exchange little smiles with the audience, the conductor and each other, as seen in the screenshot – partly reflecting the light subject-matter of the song, and partly in polite acknowledgement of their worldwide popularity as duettists. These are trained and professional singers, who can still perform a light-hearted song in the same intimate manner as lads in a student bar, and this creates immediate empathy in the audience. This is fine, professional singing with an effect as light as air.  These performers are able to demonstrate very gently the plane on which musicians live while on stage: the kind of musical ecstasy which only happens when a performance goes just right.\n\n\n=== B.

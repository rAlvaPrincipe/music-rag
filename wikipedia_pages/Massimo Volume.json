    "text": "Massimo Volume is an Italian rock group formed in Bologna in 1992. They sing in Italian and the singer is well known for his poetic spoken-word style. Their musical style may be described as being akin to post-rock: their sound is built on guitars and drums, but rhythms are often complex and articulated, while the guitar effects are also used to effect. The structure of their songs avoid completely the verse-chorus form: in its place, their pieces tend to describe an atmosphere or a sound-scape complemented by the spoken words. \nMassimo Volume reached some notoriety in the Italian Independent Music scene in the late 1990s, particularly with the release of critically acclaimed \"Lungo i Bordi\" and \"Club Privé\". The band dismantled in the early 2000s: during this period, their bassist and lyricist, Emidio Clementi, published a series of books. However, the band reunited again in the late 2000s and in 2010 released new material collected in the CD \"Cattive Abitudini\" (translating as \"Bad Habits\"), which has been followed by another CD in 2013 \"Aspettando i Barbari\" (translating as \"Waiting for the Barbarians\"). \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== LP ===\nStanze, Underground Records 1993\nLungo i bordi, Mescal 1995\nDa qui, Mescal 1997\nClub Privé, Mescal, 1999\nCattive Abitudini, La Tempesta 2010\nAspettando i Barbari, La Tempesta 2013\nIl Nuotatore, 42 Records 2019\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nFuoco fatuo in Metal Machine Muzak, 1997\n\n\n=== Soundtracks ===\nAlmost Blue, Cecchi Gori Music 2001\n\n\n=== Singles/Music Videos ===\n1995 - Il Primo Dio\n2010 - Fausto\n2011 - Un Altro Domani\n2013 - La Cena\n\n\n== Line-up ==\nEmidio Clementi: bass, vocals\nEgle Sommacal: guitars\nVittoria Burattini: drums, percussions\n\n\n=== Other members ===\nGabriele Ceci - guitars (1991–1997)\nUmberto Palazzo - guitars, vocals (1991–1992)\nMetello Orsini - guitars (1997–1999)\nMarcella Riccardi - guitars, vocals (1999–2002)\nDario Parisini - guitars (1999–2000)\nStefano Pilia - guitars (2008)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

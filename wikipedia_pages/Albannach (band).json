    "text": "Albannach, Scottish Gaelic for \"Scottish,\" is a band formed in 2005 in Glasgow, Scotland. Their traditional music is heavily percussive, driven by bass drums, bodhráns, and a single bagpipe. Albannach released their first album, the eponymous Albannach, in 2006. Since, the band has independently released four additional studio albums and frequently performs music at Highland games, Scottish festivals, and Celtic cultural events across North America and the United Kingdom. With little exception, Albannach's discography is instrumental, though several vocal songs are included in live shows.\nThe band championed the cause of Scottish independence during the 2014 independence referendum, releasing an EP titled Independence to support the \"yes\" vote. Some songs, such as A'Maighdeann Bharrach (The Maiden of Barra), are sung in Scottish Gaelic.\nThe band has been used as extras in a Discovery Channel documentary retelling of ancient history.\nAfter a 2011 show at the Glasgow Highland Games in Glasgow, Kentucky, band member Jamesie Johnston was stabbed in the midsection and leg by a drunk and belligerent fan, leading to his hospitalization. Johnston recovered, and the assailant was sentenced to 12 years for the first-degree assault.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nJamesie Johnston – bass drum, backing vocals (2005–present)\nDonnie MacNeil – bag pipe, additional drums (2005–present)\nJacquie Holland – lead vocals, bass rhythm drum (2005–present)\nDrew \"DidgeriDrew\" Reid – didgeridoo (2005–present)\nNick Watson – drums (2019–present)\n\n\n=== Former and intermittent members ===\nKyle Gray – drums (2005–2009)\nColin Walker – drums (2009–2018)\nAya Thorne – bodhrán, tambourine (2005–2015)\nDavey \"Ramone\" Morrison – bodhrán, backing baritone vocals (intermittent)\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Discography ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\nAlbannach (2006)\nEye of the Storm (2007)\nThe Sub-Zero Sessions (EP) (2010)\nBareknuckle Pipes & Drums  (2011)\nEvolution (EP) (2016)\nGaelgael (2019)\n\n\n==== Live albums ====\nThe Mighty Nach LIVE (2008)\nRuns In The Blood (2013)\n\n\n=== Video ===\nAlbannach Unleashed: Live At Grandfather Mountain (2006)\nCirca B.C.

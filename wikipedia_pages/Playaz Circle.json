    "text": "Playaz Circle was an American hip hop duo composed of rappers 2 Chainz and Dolla Boy, both of whom originate from College Park, Georgia. They signed with Ludacris' record label, Disturbing tha Peace, an imprint of Def Jam Recordings to release two albums: Supply & Demand (2007) and Flight 360: The Takeoff (2009). The former of which spawned the single \"Duffle Bag Boy\" (featuring Lil Wayne), their only song to enter the Billboard Hot 100; it peaked at number 15 on the chart.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1997–2010: Beginnings and debut album ===\nThe duo was formed in 1997 by childhood friends Tity Boi (later known as 2 Chainz) and Dolla Boy in College Park, Georgia. The duo put all their money together to release their independent album United We Stand, United We Fall. The album included features from Lil Fate, I-20 and others from the Disturbing tha Peace family. They were introduced to Ludacris by Lil Fate and soon became good friends.\nShortly after, Dolla Boy was incarcerated and Tity Boi was shot. As a result, no material was released from the duo until 2007. In January 2010, Playaz Circle filmed a music video for their single \"Big Dawg\" featuring Lil Wayne and Birdman at Studio Space Atlanta.\n\n\n=== 2012–2013: Untitled project and deformation ===\nIn late 2012 or early 2013, their two studio albums were removed from iTunes, most likely because of a copyright claim on the duo's name. In December 2013, 2 Chainz confirmed that he had been recently working with Dolla Boy and that the duo was planning to release another project together, although this has since failed to occur.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPlayaz Circle on MocoSpace\nPlayaz Circle French Biography"

    "text": "The Wonder of You is a compilation album by American singer Elvis Presley (1935â€“77). It was released on October 21, 2016 by RCA Records and Legacy Recordings. The album features archival vocal recordings of Elvis accompanied by new orchestral arrangements by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, recorded at the Abbey Road Studios. It also features a duet with German singer Helene Fischer.\nIt is the follow-up album to If I Can Dream (2015), which was a commercial success, selling 1.6 million copies worldwide. Elvis's ex-wife Priscilla Presley has said of The Wonder of You: \"Elvis always loved the great, operatic vocalists. We often talked about his interest in recording material that allowed him to perform in that space. It's exciting to hear him on these recordings, performing with the world-class Royal Philharmonic Orchestra via the magic of Abbey Road Studios. He would have loved these performances and I'm very happy that we were able to make this dream come true for Elvis and his fans.\"\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe album debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart earning a BPI Silver award in its debut week with sales of 63,500. The following 22 weeks, the last 4  non consecutively,  it registered, inter alia,  weekly  sales of 35,456, 28,590, 29,647, 32,261, 44,446, 54,011, 60,979, 73,461, 35,915, 15,983, 9,575, 3,540, 1,900, 1,300 and 1,000 thus totalling sales of 505,000 units while landing at #2, #3, #5, #5, #3, #4, #4, #3, #3, #4, #7, #17,  #32, #48,  #61, #70, #96,  #65,  #58, #79 and #89  respectively, and earning a BPI Gold and Platinum certification. It is Elvis' 13th UK number-one album, making him the solo artist with most UK number-one albums (and overall only behind The Beatles with 15 number-one albums). Elvis also extended the record for most UK top 10 albums, with The Wonder of You becoming his 52nd top 10 album.

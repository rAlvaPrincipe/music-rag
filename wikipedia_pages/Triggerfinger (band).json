They released their self-titled debut album Triggerfinger in 2004, after previously having released the singles Inner Peace and Camaro from the album. The album was well received by rock fans, with the band's sound being compared to bands such as Queens of the Stone Age, by the younger audience, and Led Zeppelin, by the older rock fans.\nThe album was followed by a live album called Faders Up, which featured several of their previous album's songs as well as a few covers of other bands.

In 2009, What Grabs Ya? was re-issued, with several new songs added to the track list.\n\nThe third studio album, All This Dancin' Around, was released in November 2010. The recordings of this album took place in the Sound City Studios in North Hollywood, California.

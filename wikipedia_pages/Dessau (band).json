The band was founded by John Elliott, who worked with a revolving cast of musicians to create Dessau's music. The bnd released two studio albums, 1989's Exercise in Tension by Carlyle Records and 1995's Dessau by Mausoleum.\n\n\n== History ==\nDessau was founded by composer John Elliott in 1983 out of Nashville. In 1985 he self-released Dessau's debut EP Red Languages. Happy Mood followed the next year and contained \"First Year\" from the band's debut. In 1988 the band released a 12\" single of their cover of Joy Division's \"Isolation\" , which was produced by Paul Barker of Revolting Cocks and Al Jourgensen of Ministry. The band released their debut studio album Exercise in Tension in 1989 by Carlyle Records. The EP Details Sketchy followed in 1995 and became Fifth Colvmn's fastest selling release.\nIn 1995 Dessau released an extended track remix of the song \"Suffer\" for the Fascist Communist Revolutionaries compilation and their self-titled second album for Mausoleum. The band covered Paul Dresser's \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\" and released it on Fifth Colmn's World War Underground compilation in 1996 and again on the 1998 Coolidge 50 compilation. In 1999 the band released a cover of \"Revenge\" by Ministry on Another Prick in the Wall - A Tribute to Ministry - Volume 2 by Invisible Records.

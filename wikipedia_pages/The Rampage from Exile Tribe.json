The Rampage is part of the collective supergroup, Exile Tribe and is composed of sixteen members. The group was formed in 2014 and the members were chosen from Exile's Vocal Battle Audition 4, Exile Performer Battle Audition and Global Japan Challenge auditions. The Rampage made their debut in January 2017 with the release of their first single \"Lightning\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2014–2016: Pre-debut ===\nOn April 11, 2014, Exile Hiro announced on the TV show Sukkiri!! a new group being formed for Exile Tribe.\nOn September 12, 2014, the final sixteen members of The Rampage were recruited from participants of \"Exile Performer Battle Audition\", a competition to be part of EXILE, \"Vocal Battle Audition 4\", a competition for young people who dream of being vocalists, and \"Global Japan Challenge\", a program for young people who dream of performing internationally and form a dance and vocal group. The name of the group, \"The Rampage (run about wildly)\" shows that the group would always dance wildly and passionately on stage. Before debuting, they went on their Musha Shugyo, touring the country for 2 years as part of their training. They performed for free in various places in Japan. Through these performances, they bonded as a group, improved as performers and gained fans.

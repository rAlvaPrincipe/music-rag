    "text": "Pimlico Opera is an opera company and registered charity founded in 1987 by Wasfi Kani.\nThe company aims to use participation in opera to advance personal development – particularly with younger people and to engender a sense of community.\nThe most recent production from Pimlico Opera was Sweet Charity staged in HMP Bronzefield in November 2018. Olivier award-nominated actress Laura Pitt-Pulford played the leading role of Charity Hope Valentine.\n\n\n== History ==\nThough its focus today is solely in prisons and primary schools, Pimlico Opera was known for 19 years (1990-2008) as an Arts Council-funded small-scale touring company. In those years, repertoire included the Da Ponte trilogy, Cenerentola, Falstaff, Pagliacci, Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto, Gianni Schicchi and the company travelled from Berwick-upon-Tweed to Padstow in Cornwall. \nPimlico Opera staged the European première of Shostakovich's musical comedy Cheryomushki at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith on 20 October  1994. A translation was commissioned David Pountney and composer Gerard McBurney to create a reduced orchestration. A documentary was made by the BBC \"Another Bite of the Cherry\".\n\n\n== In prison ==\nPimlico Opera has been staging productions in prisons since 1991. In 1993, BBC Wales filmed the three-month process involved in putting on a show inside a prison. This was made into a documentary called Guys, Dolls and D-Wing that was aired on BBC2.\nPrison projects since 1991:\n1991: HMP Wormwood Scrubs Sweeney Todd\n1992: HMP Wandsworth West Side Story\n1993: HMP Wandsworth Guys & Dolls\n1995: HMP Wandsworth West Side Story\n1996: Mountjoy Prison Dublin  West Side Story \n1997: HMP Bullingdon, Oxfordshire West Side Story\n1999: HMP Downview  Threepenny Opera.\n2001: HMP Winchester Threepenny Opera\n2002: HMP Winchester West Side Story\n2003: HMP Wormwood Scrubs Guys & Dolls\n2004 HMP Ashwell, Leicestershire Assassins\n2005: HMP Coldingley, Surrey Assassins\n2006: HMP Bronzefield Middlesex Chicago\n2007: HMP Wandsworth Les Miserables\n2008: HMP Kingston Sweeney Todd (Project cancelled)\n2009: HMP Wandsworth West Side Story\n2010: HMP Wandsworth Carmen - The Musical\n2011: HMP Send, Surrey Sugar\n2012: HMP Erlestoke, Wiltshire Les Miserables \n2013: HMP Erlestoke, Wiltshire West Side Story\n2014: HMP Bronzefield Sister Act\n2015: HMP ISIS Our House\n2017: HMP High Down Les Miserables\n2018: HMP Bronzefield Sweet Charity\n\n\n== In primary schools ==\nEvery week of the school year, Pimlico Opera gives 2,000 primary children a half hour singing class. Schools are selected in which there is little or no music provision, with KS2 results below the national average and a high percentage of free school meals.\nThe project takes place in Hampshire, Surrey, Durham, Newcastle, and Nottingham.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMaycock, Robert (22 October 1994). \"OPERA / House warming: Cheryomushki - Pimlico Opera\".

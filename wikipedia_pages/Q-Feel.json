    "text": "Q-Feel was a British synthpop group.  They released their self-titled album in 1982, which included their only hit single, \"Dancing in Heaven (Orbital Be-Bop)\". It was an entry in the 1982 A Song for Europe, the UK's pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. It finished sixth (out of eight) behind eventual winners Bardo. The outfit remains a one-hit wonder.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe song \"Dancing in Heaven (Orbital Be-Bop)\" was featured in the 1985 dance film, Girls Just Want to Have Fun, and the opening sequence of the 2007 retro comedy, Kickin' It Old Skool. Due to its presence in Girls Just Want to Have Fun, the song gained significant exposure in Los Angeles, where Top 40 radio station 102.7 KIIS-FM championed the record, making it one of their most-played songs at the time of the film's release. \n\n\n== After break-up ==\nGroup frontman Martin Page went on to achieve success as a songwriter and solo artist. He has frequently collaborated with fellow Q-Feel alumnus Brian Fairweather on songwriting and performing with other musicians. Page's debut solo album, 1994's In the House of Stone and Light featured contributions from Fairweather and fellow former Q-Feel bandmate, Trevor Thornton.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMartin Page – bass, vocals\nBrian Fairweather – guitar, vocals\nTrevor Thornton – drums\nChris Richardson – keyboards, background vocals\n\n\n=== Studio personnel ===\nNigel Green - recording engineer\nMike Shipley - recording engineer\nPeter Harris - drum programming\nMatt Wallis - assistant engineer\nJohn Kongos - Fairlight CMI synthesizer programming\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nQ-Feel (1982), Jive\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Doctor on the Radio\" (1981)\n\"Dancing in Heaven (Orbital Be-Bop)\" (1982)\n\"Crosstalk\" (1982) (promo only)\n\"Heroes Never Die\" (1984)\n\"Dancing in Heaven (Orbital Be-Bop)\" (1989) (reissue)\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nQ-Feel discography at Discogs \nQ-Feel at IMDb"

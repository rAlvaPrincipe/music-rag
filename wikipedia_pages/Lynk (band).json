Past members include Jae Curtis and 2008 Australian Idol competitor Tom Jay Williams. The band currently reside in Adelaide, South Australia.  They are best known as winners of the Nova FM Fresh Discovery and MTV (Australia and New Zealand) Brand New  competitions.\n\n\n== Music career ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early years ===\nAt Sunset formed in January 2012 in Adelaide, when university friends Harrison Kantarias and Jae Curtis got together and started playing covers at their local pubs.  During a rehearsal session, Harrison's brother Andrew joined in which led to the curation of At Sunset.  The band began by performing covers and posting them to YouTube, which received significant social media attention, particularly for their cover of One Direction's One Thing.  They also amassed over a million views for their cover of Justin Bieber's As Long As You Love Me.\nWhen later asked the reasons for the name \"At Sunset\", Harrison Kantarias noted 'At Sunset' was decided upon because: \"the name is a metaphor for our feeling towards music. We like to be upbeat, positive and really just enjoying life. Playing music, setting suns, beaches, pools, girls in bikinis... it doesn't get better than that, does it?\"\nIn 2012, At Sunset released their first EP, 'Back in Time'. The EP was released digitally, with physical copies only being sold at live shows.\n\n\n=== 2014-2016: Departure of Curtis and final releases as At Sunset ===\nOn 24 February 2014, Curtis announced via his YouTube channel that he was leaving the band.

This win was followed by a mentoring session with Ed Sheeran and a recording deal with Warner Music Australasia for their debut single Every Little Thing, which was released on 10 April 2015.\nLater in 2015, At Sunset were nominated for MTV (Australia and New Zealand)'s Brand New competition.  After receiving more than 200,000 votes, At Sunset were announced the winner at an MTV special event at The Metro Theatre on 22 September 2015, ahead of runner up Conrad Sewell.\nOn 22 January 2016, At Sunset released their single Kiss Me.\n\n\n=== 2016: Name change and formation of LYNK ===\nOn 30 June 2016, At Sunset announced on their social media accounts that they were disbanding, and LYNK was formed. Harrison and Andrew have continued together in this band with their younger brother Matthew Kantarias, however Tom has veered onto a solo pathway and is currently writing songs.\nOn 16 November 2016, LYNK released the first cover with the new name on their YouTube channel, a cover/mashup of 'Closer' by The Chainsmokers and Troye Sivan's 'Youth'.\n\n\n=== 2017-present: Best Cover Ever series and first release as Lynk ===\nIn November 2017, Lynk appeared on the YouTube series Best Cover Ever.

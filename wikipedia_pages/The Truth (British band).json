    "text": "The Truth are a British rock band, active from 1982 to 1989. They reformed in 2012 for occasional live performances.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe group was formed by Dennis Greaves, formerly of Nine Below Zero, and Mick Lister in early 1982. They went through several line-up changes, but Greaves and Lister remained members throughout the group's run. They released several singles before their first album, Playground,  was issued in 1985.  The 1987 release Weapons of Love marked a stylistic change, and was their most commercially successful release in the United States. The title track was a hit single in the U.S., reaching No. 7 on the rock chart and No. 65 on the Billboard Hot 100. Several songs from the album were also used in the 1987 cult sci-fi film The Hidden. After 1989's Jump, they disbanded.\nIn 2012, Greaves reformed The Truth and played at London's Borderline on 26 October 2012.

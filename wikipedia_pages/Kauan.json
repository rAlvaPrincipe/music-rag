    "text": "Kauan is an atmospheric doom metal/post-rock band from Chelyabinsk, Russia, formed in 2005.\nKauan's name stems from the Finnish language, meaning for a long time, and many of the band's lyrics are in Finnish. The band moved to Finland in 2022 and is based in Helsinki.\n\n\n== History ==\nKauan was formed by Anton Belov (formerly of Helengard) in February 2005. At the beginning, their sound was a blend of folk metal, black metal and doom metal.\nIn September 2006, Lyubov Mushnikova joined the band on violin. Guitarist Alexander Borovikh joined prior to the recording of their debut album, Lumikuuro, released 4 August 2007 by BadMoodMan Music.\nBorovikh left the band prior to the recording of their second album, Tietäjän laulu, which was released by BadMoodMan Music on 30 November 2008. The album incorporated ambient and post-rock elements.\nKauan released their third album, Aava tuulen maa, on 18 November 2009 on Firebox Records/BadMoodMan Music. By that point, the band's genre had evolved to a melancholic mixture of atmospheric neofolk and post-rock.\nIn 2010, Belov and his wife, vocalist Alina \"Witch_A\" Belova (formerly of Inferno and Semargl), released a full-length album on Firebox Records with his other project Helengard.\nOn 26 June 2011, Kauan's fourth album, Kuu.., was released by Avantgarde Music. The album featured a strong post-rock/ambient sound with elements of doom metal. Mushnikova left the band later in 2011.\nBelov assembled a full band lineup in 2013, including Belova as keyboardist as well as bassist Alex Vynogradoff (also of Vin De Mia Trix), viola player Anatoly Gavrylov and drummer Anton Skrynnik (ex-Dimicandum). This lineup performed on Kauan's fifth album, Pirut, released by Blood Music on 15 December 2013. That same year, the band self-released a digital compilation box set, Private Release, reissued in part in 2014 as Muistumia by Blood Music.\nThe next Kauan studio album, Sorni Nai, was streamed on 15 October 2015, and released on 20 October. A concept album consisting of one continuous song sectioned as seven tracks, it explored the mysterious 1959 Dyatlov Pass incident.\nThe band's seventh studio album, Kaiho, was released 22 September 2017. It featured lyrics by Finnish folk singer Marja Mattlar.\nKauan's eighth studio album, Ice Fleet, was released on 9 April 2021.\nBetween 2021 and 2022, Kauan released three live albums Sorni Nai live, Pirut live and Lumikuuro live. All three have been recorded in the band's live performance in Kyiv, Ukraine in 2017.\nKauan released ATM Revised on 24 February 2023. The album is a reimagination of Aava tuulen maa, fully remixed and remastered with the original sample based drums and bass guitar replaced by real instruments.\nKauan relocated to Finland in 2021 and announced a new lineup in 2024, with bassist Niko Salminen, drummer Kristian Merilahti and violist Helena Dumell.\n\n\n== Other projects ==\nIn 2016, Belov announced that he had also joined as a member of Vynogradoff's project A Noend of Mine.\nAnton Belov had an interview with Ruard Veltmaat of Progwereld in August 2020.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nAnton Belov – composer, vocals (2005–present), guitar, keyboards, programming (2005–2013)\nAlina Belova – keyboards, backing vocals (2013–present)\nHelena Dumell - viola (2024-present)\nNiko Salminen - bass guitar (2024–present)\nKristian Merilahti - drums (2024–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nAlexander Borovikh – guitar, backing vocals (2007)\nLyubov Mushnikova – violin (2006–2011)\nAlex Vynogradoff – bass guitar, backing vocals (2013–2024)\nAnton Skrynnik – drums (2013–2024)\nAnatoly Gavrylov – viola (2013–2024)\n\n\n=== Session members ===\nIgor Andrievskiy - violin\nMaxim Rymar - cello\nVladimir Babutin - cello\nArtur Andriasyan - keyboards, backing vocals\nAstaroth Merc - lead guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nLumikuuro (2007, BadMoodMan Music)\nTietäjän laulu (2008, BadMoodMan Music)\nAava tuulen maa (2009, Firebox Records/BadMoodMan Music)\nKuu..

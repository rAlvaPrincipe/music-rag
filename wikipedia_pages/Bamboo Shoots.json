    "text": "Bamboo Shoots is an American four-piece musical group based out of Brooklyn, New York, and suburban New Jersey.  They are known for their dueling, two-person rhythm section and their South Asian identity and influence.  Their debut album released on September 29, 2009, on Epic Records.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nBamboo Shoots played their first show at Pianos in New York City in 2004, however most of the members were friends prior to being in the band.  Avir and Karl met as young children through the Zoroastrian community in Southern New Jersey (Karl’s parents and Avir’s mother are of Parsi heritage).  When Avir was 12, he got a guitar and within two years Karl got a guitar and the two began playing music together.  They began writing songs together soon after.\nAvir met Shiv while spending the night at a mutual friend’s dorm in New York University.  Shiv, a student in the Stern School of Business, had already heard some songs Avir had made and the two became friends.  Avir, Karl and Shiv began playing house parties and writing informally under the moniker Bojangles.  Ankur’s brother was a friend of Avir and introduced Ankur to the group at an early practice.  Ankur reportedly began playing a dhol over their songs and became a band member that day.\n\n\n=== mtvU Contest ===\nIn late 2006 Bamboo Shoots casually signed up for the mtvU Best Music on Campus contest.

Within a few months they were voted into the top 15, then the top 5.  Friends and fans from all over the world helped propel the band forward with their votes.

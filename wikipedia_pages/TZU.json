    "text": "TZU (pronounced \"Tee Zed Yoo\") were an Australian hip hop group, formed in 1999 by Joelistics, Yeroc, Seed MC and Paso Bionic. They used instruments in live performances, giving their shows a rock-infused feeling. Duzy What joined in 2005. TZU released four studio albums, Position Correction (2004), Smiling at Strangers (2005), Computer Love (2008, which peaked in the ARIA Charts top 30) and Millions of Moments (2012), before disbanding in 2013.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1999-2004: Formation, Um... Just A Liddlbidova Mic Check, Position Correction ===\nTZU formed in 1999 in Melbourne, initially as a side project. The group's lineup stayed the same until their disbandment; MCs Joel Ma (p.k.a. Joelistics) and Phillip \"Pip\" Norman (p.k.a. Seed MC and later known as Count Bounce) [ex-Pan], who also played guitar and bass; Corey McGregor (p.k.a. Yeroc) on drums and samplers, and Shehab Tariq (p.k.a. Pasobionic) on turntables. According to Seed MC, the group started out as an almagation of two groups; Pan and Curse ov Dialect. Pan, the group he was a part of, were a \"drum-and-bass/funk/reggae mash-up\" band, while Curse ov Dialect (who Pasobionic was a part of) were an \"oddball experimental hip hop group with a penchant for throwing meat at the audience.\"\nAccording to Joelistics, the group's name is taken from the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu, which was suggested by Lee Hartney of the Smith Street Band. Styled as TZU and originally pronounced \"Tzu\", the pronunciation of the band's name was changed to \"Tee Zed You\" early on in their career to add an \"element of mystery.\" Their debut six-track extended play (EP), Um... Just A Liddlbidova Mic Check (2001), was recorded in a portable studio in the back of a truck parked near Hobart. Local Noise's Tony Mitchell described it as \"tentative.\" After the EP's release, they were signed to Liberation Music, who they would release all their future material under.\nTZU released their debut album, Position Correction, on 19 February 2004. The album was co-produced by Seed and Yeroc and peaked just outside the ARIA Charts Top 100 in March. Greg Lawrence of WHAMMO described how the quartet, \"[are] a bunch of true technicians who successfully transmit their love for beats and lyrics. The double-pronged vocal attack is more exact than the scalpel of a master surgeon, the subterranean bass growls and snappy beats are premium.\" Tony Mitchell felt \"[it] covers a wide range of moods, styles and tempos, and represents another new direction in Australian hip-hop coming from an idiosyncratic Melbourne push which is making an important impact on local indigenisations of the genre.\"\n\n\n=== 2005 - 2009: Smiling / Snarling At Strangers, Computer Love ===\nIn 2005 keyboard player, Dustin McLean (p.k.a. Duzy What) was added to the group's line-up. TZU issued their second studio album, Smiling at Strangers, which was produced by Magoo (Regurgitator, Butterfingers). It reached the ARIA Albums Chart top 100 in late September. Mitchell noticed, \"[they] can successfully combine rock and hip hop... through a desire to experiment with and stretch the often restrictive parameters of MCing and Djing.\" Simon Jones of Soulshine compared it to their debut album, \"[they] have taken a more instrument-based approach in the studio, leaving behind the beats and samples of their debut Position Correction and replacing them with guitars, piano, drums and the occasional horn line.\" In February 2006 the album was short-listed for the inaugural Australian Music Prize for releases in 2005.\nIn February-March 2006, they won Yahoo! Music's \"Who's Next\" monthly music public-voted poll. In November of that year they re-released Smiling at Strangers as a limited edition 2×CD, Snarling at Strangers, which, along with the original album's fourteen tracks, included a second five-track disc, Snarl, and three music videos. The additional, previously unreleased tracks were described by Tristan of There Is no Roseability as, \"a harsh critique of current politics/society. It's not as militaristic or angry as The Herd's material, but it's harsh nonetheless. It still has the genius wit and timelessness of Australian hip-hop.\"\nIn 2008, the band released their third studio album, Computer Love. Rolling Stone Australia said \"Melbourne group TZU just can't stop upping the ante ... They meld classic eighties electro with the more traditional funk keeping the emphasis on authenticity and class throughout.\" Inpress said \"Computer Love is full of old school synth's, masterful sampling and live instrumentation - a maverick in its field and release that will set a new standard for the Australian music landscape.\" \nRichard Kingsmill, Musical Director of Australian radio station Triple J, stated in regard to the band's 2008 J Award nomination for Computer Love, \"They open their album saying \"TZU still feelin' awesome\". I couldn't agree more. They keep growing as an act and expanding on their influences. This album has so much life and they're doing all this themselves. No mentors, producers or anyone getting in the way. Pure talent.\"\nA remix album, titled Cover Up Motel, was released the following year in 2009, which featured remixes of songs from Computer Love. The title of the album is an anagram of Computer Love.\n\n\n=== 2010–2013: Millions of Moments, disbandment ===\nIn 2012, after a period of inactivity, TZU released their fourth and final album Millions of Moments. The album is a concept album about a woman named Persephone who test-trials a mind-altering drug called Chronos which takes her through the minds of various people in different points in time. The concept stemmed from Joelistics' travels in Asia, as he explains in an interview with Beat Magazine:\n\n“I was constantly in front of screens [...] laptops and phones and being outside the environment I was in. Like being in Mongolia on a train and still being in front of my laptop! Chronos became this idea of being addicted to experiences that aren’t yours – the idea of Chronos is that you’re inside the consciousness of someone else in a different time period, so you’re not actually an active participant of that person’s experience … you’re just a passenger to what’s happening to them.”\nSonically, the album takes a detour from hip-hop to opt for a darker, more experimential electronic pop sound. In the same interview with Beat Magazine, Joelistics also delves into the reasoning behind this:\n\n“It wasn’t that we didn’t want to make a hip hop record, as much as it was that we just followed our noses into the sound of the record. It wasn’t like trying to alienate ourselves from our past or anything like that – it was simply… I reckon the reason this album particularly is very un-hip hop, at the heart of it, is that there’s always been this side of the band where we get together and do all the out-takes from our old albums in these slow, sort of instrumental jams. And in every album, there’s probably three or four slow, psychedelic songs that never got released; unfinished, quite electronic and a bit nerdy! When we came together for those first few weeks [of recording], that was the side that – you know, if there wasn’t going to be any outcome from this, let’s do what we’ve always wanted to do. ‘Set up at your station with your synths and your samplers and let’s jam!’ That was the spirit of it, and that’s what led us to not do a hip hop record; we’ve really got to indulge that side of us.”\nTo promote the album, they went on tour.  The following year, the band had quietly called it quits on making music together. Joelistics and Count Bounce went on to pursue solo careers, while Paso Bionic pursued a career in design.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCredits:\n\nJoel Ma p.k.a.

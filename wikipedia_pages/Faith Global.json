The band didn't last long, so Shears went to Cowboys International and Guy formed another band, but continued to maintain contacts. Later Survival Records (label founded by the duo Drinking Electricity) offered them money to work in the studio.\nIn Survival, recorded and released an EP called Earth Report in 1982 and the album The Same Mistakes in 1983.

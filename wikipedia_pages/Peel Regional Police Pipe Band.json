    "text": "The Peel Regional Police Pipe Band is a Canadian pipe band organization based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in 1976.\nThe band's Pipe Major is John Cairns; the lead drummer is Cameron Mckail; and the mid-section leader is Reagan Jones\nIn 2002, the band accompanied Paul McCartney during his song \"Mull of Kintyre\" at a concert at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Peel dominated the grade 1 field, finishing as North American Champions and PPBSO Champion Supreme in each of those years. However, as a result of police restructuring in the fall of 2014, the band was no longer able to utilize highly qualified long-distance players.  This severely impacted the band’s performance standard and relegated the band to, or near, the bottom of grade 1 standings in Ontario, as well as at the World Pipe Band Championships.\nAs a result, in the fall of 2017, the band was downgraded to grade 2 by the RSPBA. The band leadership immediately embraced this decision and saw it as an opportunity to restructure the organization, to develop new local players, and to establish a multi-level teaching program.  \nIn 2018, in order to develop prospective players, a new Developmental Program was added to the organization. \nSince then, the grade 2 band has finished as North American Champions and PPBSO Champion Supreme winners in 3 of the 4 years that competitions were held (due to COVID). \nThe band has close to 100 members in multiple levels within the organization\n\nThe senior level (the grade 2 band) has more than 40 members, with over 90% of the members now being local\nThere are also 3 training levels within the band’s developmental program (very much like a farm-team in a sports organization) that train prospective players:\na teaching program for new players\na grade 5 competitive band\na grade 4 competitive band\n\nThe majority of members are volunteers, who travel to practice every week from all over Ontario - with the average band member driving 90 minutes each way just to get to practice.\nThe band continues to exist thanks to the ongoing support of the Peel Regional Police and Chief Nishan Duraiappah.\n\nEach year the band participates in a number of events on behalf of the Peel Regional Police which include:\n\nOntario Police Memorial at Queens Park and the National Peace Officer’s Memorial on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.\nRecruit graduation ceremonies\nAwards and promotion ceremonies\nCommunity events\n\n\n== Pipe Majors ==\nMichael Grey (1995-1999)\nJohn Elliott (1993-1994, 2000-2006)\nGlenn Brown (2007-2008)\nJohn Cairns (2009–present)\n\n\n== Lead Drummers ==\nDrew Duthart (2000)\nDoug Stronach (2001-2003)\nCraig Stewart (2004-2007)\nGraham Brown (2008-2012)\nGraham Kirkwood (2013-2016)\nHarvey Dawson (2016–2023)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nWaulking the Beat (1997)\nFever (2011)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe band competing at 2006 Kincardine Highland Games"

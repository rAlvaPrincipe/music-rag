    "text": "McKenzie and Condon's Chicagoans was an American jazz band from Chicago, led by banjo player Eddie Condon and sponsored by singer and comb player Red McKenzie. Their four recordings in December 1927 were important influences on early Chicago style jazz.\nThe group got together in 1962 for a reunion, to record the album Chicago and All That Jazz. Pee Wee Russell replaced Frank Teschemacher, who had died in 1932, on the clarinet, and Bob Haggart filled in for the retired bassist Jim Lanigan. Trombonist Jack Teagarden joined the group for the sessions.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nEddie Condon – banjo\nBud Freeman – tenor saxophone\nGene Krupa – drums\nJim Lanigan – bass\nJimmy McPartland – cornet\nMezz Mezzrow – cymbals\nFrank Teschemacher – clarinet\nJoe Sullivan – piano\n\n\n== Notes =="

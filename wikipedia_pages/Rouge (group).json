After five qualifying rounds, eight girls were selected for the final stage that and the judges selected Aline Wirley, Fantine Thó, Karin Hils, Li Martins (at the time known as Patrícia Lissa) and Luciana Andrade. The name chosen for the group was Rouge \"because it has five letters and also because in French it means red, a color associated with sensuality [...] and it's pop!\".\n\n\n=== 2002–03: Commercial breakthrough with Rouge and C'est La Vie ===\n\nThe band released their debut album, Rouge, on August 19, 2002, produced by Rick Bonadio. The label bet heavily on the band and distributed around 150,000 copies of the album in the stores already in first consignment. On the same day, lead single \"Não Dá para Resistir\" was released, becoming a hit on the singles charts in Brazil and Argentina. Riding a wave of publicity and hype, the group's second single \"Ragatanga\", featured by Las Ketchup, instantly entered the top position on the Brazilian charts. The song accumulated 11 weeks at number one in Brazil. After five months, the album had sold 1 million copies and was eventually certified double platinum by the Pro-Música Brasil (PMB). Rouge sold over 2 million copies and was the second biggest-selling Brazilian album of 2002. The remix album titled Rouge Remixes was released alongside the video album O Sonho de Ser Uma Popstar.\nOn May 4, 2003, the Rouge released their second album, C'est La Vie.

The recording became second Rouge's video album, A Festa dos Seus Sonhos, released on December 22.\n\n\n=== 2004–06:  Blá Blá Blá, Mil e Uma Noites and disbandment ===\nOn February 11, 2004, Andrade announced her departure from the Rouge through press conference. The singer first cited that she was suffering from exhaustion and disillusionment. Rumours of a power struggle with Thó circulated in the press. She revealed, in an interview years later, that her departure was due to mobbing committed by manager and low pay. The other members said that her departure had a positive effect because this made them reevaluate their careers. Rouge announced that they would return to the studios after the end of Carnival in 2004, where they would slow down activities to focus on producing their third studio album. On May 26, 2004, the group released Blá Blá Blá, which contains a more mature side of pop music. From the album, four singles were taken: the title track and \"Sem Você\" reached the top five on the Brazilian Charts. With a total of about 150,000 copies sold however, it failed to achieve the success of its two best-selling predecessors, still going gold.

In August 2006, this actually happened and they announced they were going their separate ways, concentrating on their individual solo careers.\n\n\n=== 2012–16: Comeback attempt ===\nIn late 2012, rumours about a return restarted on social networks, specially Twitter, as Bonadio posted the hashtag #VoltaRouge (en: Come Back Rouge). Some meetings of the girls were noticed and published through the web. Officially, a return of the band was confirmed by Bonadio and the girls itself, although Andrade refused to join the band members, saying that she needed to be truthful with herself and her decision. Shes also said: \"They are Rouge, the girls that stayed. They are the soul of the group, so they are the ones who must come back\".\nA tour commemorating 10 years of creation of the group was confirmed for 2013, in Brazil. Along with it, a new Reality Show for Multishow, Fabrica de Estrelas broadcast was announced for Bonadio to select girls for a new girlgroup.

Karin and Fantine wrote the Portuguese version of the original song and released \"Tudo Outra Vez\" (en: All again).\nDespite all efforts, though, bureaucracy got in their way as they were not the legal owners of the name and brand Rouge, this being owned by their previous recording label. Bonadio and the girls decided on quitting the plans for a return as well as the release of single \"Tudo É Rouge\", and an apologizing letter for the fans was released through social media.\n\n\n=== 2017–2019: Reunion, tour and second disbandment ===\n\nIn August 2017 the 15th anniversary of the Rouge was intensely celebrated by the fans and all the former members. On September 13 was announced the return of the group with the original line-up. On 14 day, tickets were put up for sale and sold out in a minute. But as there were problems with some purchases, it was still possible to get some tickets. After three hours, the organization of the event announced that the five thousand tickets had been exhausted and an extra show was scheduled for the following day. A new extra show was scheduled for December 2, and was sold out the same day. In October 2017, it was confirmed that Rouge had returned definitively.\n\nThe group's comeback first single, \"Bailando\" was released January 2018.

Initially, the group starred commercials for Mother's Day and Christmas by Marisa's retail clothing stores and even with autographed stickers of the members being distributed through Marisa stores in Brazil. On September 9, 2003 the toy company Baby Brink released the dolls of five group members. In 2004 the Rouge also closed with a contract with Arcor, a company that released chewing gum, confectionery and Easter egg, all with the image of the members. More than seven types of products were produced.\nIn 2003 Editora Abril released the Rouge's sticker album, with 180 figurines for fans of the group to collect. The same year the Grendene released a Sandal with group logo. In 2011 Tilibra released a line of Rouge's notebooks, with a different color for each notebook.\n\n\n== Public image and impact ==\n\nDuring their career, Rouge became one of Brazil's record-breaking acts, with more than 6 million albums sold, being the best-selling girl group in Brazil and Latin America. One of the group's albums also appears in the list of the best selling albums in the history of the Brazilian music industry – the debut album of the group, certificated double platinum. Described as the \"Brazilian Spice Girls\", some vehicles credited the group for being part of Brazilian pop; Some critics called them \"laboratory rats\" and \"pop cinderellas.\"\nEduardo Coelho of ‘’Fatos Desconhecidos’’ website revered the reality show Popstars for revealing the group, writing that \"even with the pros and cons of the format, something that is undeniable with regards to reality shows on national soil is that they at least created, shaped and produced a true phenomenon called: Rouge, in the year 2002\". The writer also praised the group's most successful song \"Ragatanga\", claiming it impossible to forget and saying its choreography is epic. Cristiano Freitas, from the website A Escotilha, defined the contribution of the group to Brazilian pop as a \"major phenomenon of the genre ever revealed in Brazil.\" Diário do Nordeste credited the group for giving “face to pure Brazilian pop music, bringing the “girl band” concept to Brazil, popularized especially by the Spice Girls. Journalist Diego Bargas from the site Folha compared Rouge even further to the Spice Girls, stating that both have many similarities. Like Rouge, the British quintet experienced the meteoric success still young; at their career momentum, they both suffered the departure of a member. Both groups had little time in total activity, but they have kept many fans.”\nSeveral artists cited Rouge as an influence in some aspect in their careers; among them are the Brazilian singers Anitta, Pabllo Vittar, Gloria Groove, the girl group Girls, and the actors Maisa Silva, Tiago Abravanel, and Fernanda Souza.\n\n\n== Member timeline ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nRouge (2002)\nC'est La Vie (2003)\nBlá Blá Blá (2004)\nMil e Uma Noites (2005)\nLes 5inq (2019)\n\n\n== Concert tours ==\nHeadlining\n\nPopstar Tour (2002—03)\nC'est La Vie Tour (2003—04)\nBlá Blá Blá Tour (2004)\nMil e Uma Noites Tour (2005)\n15 Anos Tour (2018)\nCo-headlining\n\nPlaneta Pop: Rouge & Br'oz Tour (2004)\nPromotional tours\n\nChá Rouge Tour (2017–22)\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of best-selling girl groups\nList of girl groups\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nRouge Website Archived 2017-11-08 at the Wayback Machine\nRouge on Instagram"

They were signed by Shoeshine Records in Glasgow, and their July 2002 debut album Soon It Will Come Time to Face the World Outside was released to critical acclaim, including 4-Star reviews in Uncut, Mojo, Q Magazine and The Irish Times. The album was selected for the 2009 Hot Press magazine \"250 Greatest Irish Albums Of All Time\" list.\nDuring this period, the band played live extensively, including supporting acts such as Teenage Fanclub, Calexico and Howe Gelb, as well as headline shows around Ireland and a UK tour with label-mates The Beauty Shop and Major Matt Mason USA. Boa Morte released their second album The Dial Waltz in 2009 on their Kicking a Can label.\nBoa Morte began recording their third album, \"Before There Was Air\", in September 2018 for the London-based Gare Du Nord label.

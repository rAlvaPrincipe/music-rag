    "text": "Cephas & Wiggins was an American acoustic blues duo, composed of the guitarist John Cephas (September 4, 1930 – March 4, 2009) and the harmonica player Phil Wiggins (May 8, 1954 – May 7, 2024) They were known for playing Piedmont blues.\n\n\n== History ==\nBoth musicians were born in Washington D.C. Cephas, who was 24 years older than Wiggins, grew up in Bowling Green, Virginia. They first met at a jam session at the Smithsonian's Festival of American Folklife in 1976 and played together in Wilbert \"Big Chief\" Ellis's band. When Ellis died, they decided to continue as a duo.\nIn 1980, Cephas & Wiggins were recorded by the German archivists Siegfried Christmann and Axel Küstner. These recordings, their first as a duo, were released the following year as a part of the Living Country Blues USA series on the German label L+R. They also appeared around Washington, D.C., with the Travelling Blues Workshop, which included John Jackson, Archie Edwards, Flora Molton, and Mother Scott.\nTheir first U.S. release, the album Dog Days of August, was issued by  Flying Fish Records in 1986. Two more albums followed from Flying Fish. After they left the label, they released one album for the New York–based Chesky Records and four albums for Alligator Records. They released the album Richmond Blues on Folkways Records in 2008.\nUntil the late 1980s, Cephas made his primary living as a carpenter at the D.C. National Armory, playing music on the side. In the 1990s, he became a professional musician, sometimes earning money by teaching classes and workshops.\nAs a duo, they toured extensively, primarily courtesy of the sponsorship of the United States Department of State. They performed together across the USA, as well as in Africa, Asia, South and Central America, and the Soviet Union.\nCephas was a recipient of a 1989 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. In 2017, Wiggins received a National Heritage Fellowship as well. Wiggins received the State of Maryland Heritage Award in 2021.\nCephas died of pulmonary fibrosis on March 4, 2009, at age 78. He is buried at Quantico National Cemetery in Virginia. Wiggins died of multiple organ cancers at his home in Takoma Park, Maryland, on May 7, 2024, at the age of 69.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1987 Blues Music Awards, Entertainer of the Year Award winners\n1988 Washington DC Mayor's Arts Award for Cephas\n1989 National Heritage Fellowship for Cephas\n1990 Blues Music Awards, Traditional Blues Album (Guitar Man) winners\nBetween 1995 and 2007, eleven Blues Music Award/W.C.

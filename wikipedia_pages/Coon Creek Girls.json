    "text": "The Coon Creek Girls were an all-female \"string band\" in the Appalachian style of folk music (a precursor of country music) which began in the mid-1930s. Created (and named) by John Lair for his Renfro Valley Barn Dance show, the band originally consisted of sisters Lily May and Rosie Ledford (from Powell County, Kentucky) along with Esther \"Violet\" Koehler (from Indiana), Evelyn \"Daisy\" Lange (from Ohio) and Norma Madge Mullins (from Renfro Valley, Kentucky).\nOn June 8, 1939, the Coon Creek Girls performed at President Franklin D. Roosevelts White House. The Coon Creek Girls were chosen by First Lady Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt to represent the music of the Ohio Valley by playing 3 songs at the White House. (Insert Citation)  King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were also in the audience of the White House of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. There were numerous musical acts, including Lawrence Tibbett, Marian Anderson, and Kate Smith. Also included was a troupe of Bascom Lunsford's square dancers, whom the Coon Creek Girls played backup music for during their performance. The Coon Creek Girls performed “How Many Biscuits Can You Eat?”, “Get Along Midd Cindy”, and “The Soldier and the Lady”. The girls were asked not to wear costumes to the White House, therefore they made their own dresses, matching the color of their dresses with their respective flower names. (Insert Citation) While they were rehearsing at the White House, they fiddled with a gentleman who called himself “Cactus Jack,” though it turned out to be Vice President John (Jack) Nance Garner. (insert citation) Both the royal family and the Roosevelts were front row for the performance. All were visibly enjoying the music except the King. Lily May wrote that she, “Caught him patting his foot even so little, and I knew we had him.” (Insert Citation) After the show was over, the Coon Creek Girls recorded their White House performance in a studio in Washington DC. The recording was meant to be a memento for the King and Queen of England to take home with them to commemorate their first visit to the White House. \nIn 1979, John Lair reinvented the band using the name the New Coon Creek Girls, a combo which remained popular for several decades, despite numerous changes in line-up. Among the former members are Pamela Gadd and Pam Perry, who later became members of the country band Wild Rose.\nIn 2013, the original touring group of the New Coon Creek Girls from 1985 to 1987 (Vicki Simmons, Pam Perry Combs, Wanda Barnett, and Pam Gadd) made the decision to reunite in order to fund speech therapy music camp for Simmons who underwent surgery for an aneurysm in 2008. As of 2014, Simmons has made an amazing recovery, and the band was still performing various reunion concerts.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFrom the Internet Archive (www.archive.org):\n\nFlowers Blooming In The Wildwood\n\n\"This item is no longer available.

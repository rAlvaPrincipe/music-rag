    "text": "Forgemasters was a British electronic music act composed of Robert Gordon, Winston Hazel and Sean Maher. Their single \"Track with No Name\" was the first release by Warp Records and would help define the sound of Warp and bleep techno.\n\n\n== History ==\nRobert Gordon, Sean Maher and Winston Hazel were colleagues in the FON record shop and studio in Sheffield. Gordon was an engineer at FON Studio and co-founder of Warp Records. The name Forgemasters was taken from a local heavy engineering firm, Sheffield Forgemasters.\nTheir single \"Track with No Name\" was the first release by Warp Records. It was of a techno subgenre, the primarily Sheffield based bleep techno, and written in four hours one evening at Gordon's home studio. Dave Simpson, writing in Fact in 2012, described it as \"driven by an eerie pulse, a sound which would soon be called a 'bleep' and become the distinctive signature of hardcore northern techno and, for its first two years, the sound of Warp.\" Matt Anniss, writing for Resident Advisor in 2014, called it \"one of the defining records of the era\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n\"Track with No Name\" (Warp, 1989) – released in association with Outer Rhythm\nThe Black Steel E.P.

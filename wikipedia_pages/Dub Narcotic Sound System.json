    "text": "Dub Narcotic Sound System (D.N.S.S.) is an Olympia, Washington based indie-funk musical group founded by Calvin Johnson, signed to K Records.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe band was named after Calvin Johnson's basement recording studio, Dub Narcotic. The band and its members were all based in Olympia, Washington when they were active in the band.  Dub Narcotic Sound System has toured in the United States, Japan, Canada and Europe with bands such as Built to Spill, Fugazi, and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe Register-Guard described the band in 1999 as an \"electronica and hip-hop tinged indie combo\". The newspaper also criticised Johnson's vocals, citing them as \"so low and gravelly, it can, at times, be unbearable\". In relation to a 1996 concert at a roller skating rink with Lois Maffeo, they described the music as \"dull to dance to, but skates can glide along to it fine\".\nThe Michigan Daily described their album Degenerate Introduction as \"an open, airy fusion of punk, funk, dub, indie rock and hip-hop with a lo-fi hue\". However, the newspaper criticised Johnson's vocals, saying they were \"polarizing and force[s] you to become annoyed as he drowns out the empty beats\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe following studio recordings by D.N.S.S. were released on K Records:\n\nIndustrial Breakdown (EP; 1995)\nRidin' Shotgun (EP; 1995)\nBoot Party  (1996)\nBone Dry (EP; 1997)\nOut Of Your Mind (1998)\nSideways Soul: Dub Narcotic Sound System meets the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in a Dancehall Style (1999)\nHandclappin' (EP; 2003)\nDegenerate Introduction (2004)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDub Narcotic Sound System at AllMusic"

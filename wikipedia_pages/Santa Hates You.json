    "text": "Santa Hates You was a German/Italian band formed in 2007. The two band members were Italian vocalist Jinxy and the frontman of Project Pitchfork, Peter Spilles, credited as PS. Both Jinxy and Spilles shared a passion for dark music, rebellious humour and macabre arts.\n\n\n== History ==\nOne of the stranger aspects of the band was their habit to exclusively work at night. The band was influenced by late 19th century and early 20th century art and literature as well as movements such as Symbolism, Surrealism and the Decadent Movement. This passion for different perspectives and psychological approaches became a foundational element in their creative process.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nJinxy: lyricist, vocalist, growler/singer, creative concept ideator (2007–2016)\nPeter \"PS\" Spilles: composer, producer, arranger, synths, vocals (2007–2016)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\nOfficial YouTube channel\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "You Yokoyama (横山 裕, Yokoyama Yū, born May 9, 1981) is a Japanese idol and singer, member of Super Eight (previously known as Kanjani Eight), which is under the management of Johnny & Associates. His image color in the group is black.\n\n\n== Career ==\nYokoyama entered Johnny's on Christmas 1996 where he met fellow members Subaru Shibutani and Shingo Murakami. The reason he entered Johnny's is because his mother briefly saw his classmate on TV and said, \"My kid is better looking.\" Rare among Johnny's talent, Yokoyama has been given a stage name. This has been said due to the difficult kanji of his real name, Kimitaka Yokoyama (横山 侯隆, Yokoyama Kimitaka). It is believed that \"You\" has been chosen by Johnny Kitagawa as it is easy to say. Although he has a stage name, nobody actually refers to him as \"You\", not even Johnny who is famous for referring to other people as \"You\".\nWhen appearing in variety shows and radio, Yokoyama and Murakami are the two most talkative members. He has even been called a comedian due to his talking style. However, off screen, Yokoyama is very shy. He rarely speaks whilst in the dressing room, as he is too busy playing games.\nRecently, Yokoyama has been appearing in quite a few dramas such as The Quiz Show 2 and Hidarime Tantei EYE.\nYokoyama's mother died at age 50 on May 16, 2010, at 11:51 pm. She collapsed while shopping, and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. Sources say that it might have been a heart attack. The funeral was held on May 18, which all the members of Kanjani8 attended.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nSolo songs\n\n\"Confusion\"\n\"Fantastic Music!\"\n\"Wonder Boy\"\n\"413man\" (Lyrics by Yokoyama)\n\"Trickster\"\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Drama ===\n\n\n=== Movie ===\n\n\n== Stage ==\nKyo to Kyo (April – November 1998)\nMask (December 1998)\nTōa Hiren (October 2001, June – July 2002)\nAoki-san Ie no Okusan (February 2002)\nTakizawa Enbu Jō (March 2006)\nDream Boys ( 2006)\nBluemoon (May 2015)\n上を下へのジレッタ (May 2017)\n北齋漫畫 (Hokusai Sketch Book) (June - July 2019)\n\n\n== Radio ==\n1994–2002: Furumoto Shinnosuke Chapara Suka Woo! – Chapara Fight Thursdays – Yokoyama You & Murakami Shingo no Warau Daisōsa Sen (JOQR 1134)\n2002–2003: Super Star Qr (JOQR 1134)\n2003–2013: Kanjani Eight – Yokoyama You & Murakami Shingo no Recomen!

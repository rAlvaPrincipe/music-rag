    "text": "Chronics are an Italian power pop and punk band, known for playing power pop with a garage rock attitude, and often drawing comparisons to The Saints (band) and The Real Kids. In 1999 they released their debut single on Rip Off Records (a cult record label in the 90′s along with In the Red Records and Sympathy For The Record Industry), along with two full-length albums and two best of records. After several years idle, Chronics returned in 2014 by releasing a split single on Asian Man Records with Mike Watt and the Secondmen. In 2015 they release two more split 7-inch, another split single with Mike Watt (Minutemen (band), The Stooges) and a split single with Barrence Whitfield & the Savages.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nIt's too late, LP, Nitro, Belgium 2002\nSuggested for Mature Audiences, LP/cd, Nitro, Belgium 2004\nDo you love the sun?, LP, Puke’n’vomit Records, USA 2022; CD, Spaghetty Town Records, USA 2023\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nFirst time, best time, 7” Rip Off Records, USA 1999\n\n\n=== Splits ===\nFrom Ciro's to Starwood, Mike Watt and the Secondmen/Chronics, Split 7-inch, Asian Man Records, USA 2014\nBack In The Microwave, Mike Watt and the Secondmen/Chronics, Split 7-inch, Org Music, USA 2015\nZig Zag Wanderer/I've Got Levitation, Barrence Whitfield And The Savages/Chronics, Split 7-inch, Easy Action Records, UK 2015\n\n\n=== Best Of ===\nLate, lit-up & lewd (best of), cd, Hate, Italy 2003\nOn Tape It Sounds Different (best of), cassette, USA Mooster, 2013\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nAll This And More, cd, Fridge Records, 2000\nBurnin' Material – Call The Firemen!! cassette, AlphaMonic, 2003\nLocals Only CD compilation – La Skaletta Rock Club\nWild Sound From The Past Dimension, Go Down records, 2008\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\nStefano Toma – guitars, vocals (1996–today)\nMarco Turci – drums (2004-today)\nMichele Rizzoli - bass, vocals (2019-today)\nGiuliano Guerrini - guitars, vocals (2022-today)\nStefano Felcini – bass, vocals (2013-today)\nRoberto Fabbri – bass, vocals (2000–2009)\nDavide Scibetta – drums (1996–2004)\nGabriele Balducci – bass, vocals (1996–2000)\n\n\n== References ==\nAndrea Tinti – Enciclopedia del rock bolognese (Punto E Virgola 2001)\nOderso Rubini – Largo all'avanguardia, Milano, Sonic Press, 2012\nMaximumrocknroll, issue 238/Mar '03, Interview\n\n\n== External links ==\nInterview on Rumore\nInterview on Razorcake\nChronics on Grunnenrocks\nChronics on Facebook\nChronics releases\nRip Off Records releases\nAsian Man Records"

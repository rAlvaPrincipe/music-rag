    "text": "Sick Individuals (stylized in all caps) are a Dutch electronic dance music act consisting of Rinze \"Ray\" Hofstee (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈrɪnzə ˈɦɔfsteː]; born 15 March 1988) and Joep \"Jim\" Smeele (Dutch pronunciation: [jup ˈsmeːlə]; born 3 November 1990). The two met in Hilversum (2008) while studying Music Composition. Jim and Ray had been composing for television commercials until their mutual fascination for both classical and modern music inspired their business partnership in 2010, when Sick Individuals was born.\nEarly in their careers, groups including Daft Punk, Bingo Players and the Swedish House Mafia influenced the duo. \nThey have also produced with Axwell on the song \"I Am\", and with Dannic on \"Blueprint\" (both reached number one on Beatport) as well as remixing songs by Rihanna, Avicii, Icona Pop, Tiësto, Flo Rida and David Guetta. Their remix of Icona Pop's \"I Love It\" received a high level of support and recognition in the dance music industry.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nThe Chainsmokers - Kills You Slowly\nBeverly - I Need Your Love\nRita Ora - Your Song\nKev - Moments\nMoby - Porcelain\nDazepark - Rift\nMadonna - Bitch I'm Madonna\nAvicii – Addicted To You\nFlo Rida – How I Feel\nJerome Isma-Ae – Hold That Sucker Down\nTimeflies – I Choose U\nRihanna and David Guetta – Right Now\nSavoy – We Are The Sun\nRoberto Da Costa featuring Daphne Koo – Excited\nDave Aude featuring Irina – One Last Kiss\nHook N Sling and Nervo – Reason\nSomeday – You're in my Head\nIcona Pop – I Love It\nQulinez – Troll\nKorr A – Firecracka\nLost Witness – Our Suns Rising\nNelly Furtado – Spirit Indestructible\nKevin Scott – Junp All Night\nMarco V – GOHF\nNelly Furtado – Big Hoops\nNire Alldai – Hella Bad\nConor Mayard – Vegas Girl\nJenny Andrews – Unhappy Ending\nDJ Pauly D – Night of My Life\nAlex Sayz and Nadia Ali – Free To Go\nJustin Bieber featuring Far East Movement – Live My Life\nVictoria Aitken – Weekend Lover\nDJ Jean – Every Single Day\nTiesto – Bleckentrommel\nHoxton Whores, MelleeFresh – Let's Get Dirty\nNu Soul Family – This Is for My People\nGo Back to the Zoo – Hey DJ\nKato – Celebrate Life\nLaurent Simeca – On Fire\nFreestylers – Cracks\nSteve Edwards, Louis Botella and Joe Smooth – Promised Land\nFlo Rida – Good Feeling\nNatalia Kills featuring Will.I.am – Free\nJosh The Funky 1 – Love The World\nTuccillo and Patty Pravo – La Bambola\nIrad Brant – We Must Go On\nHousequake – Give A Little Love\nDark Matters featuring Jessie Morgan – Miracles\nFranky Rizardo – Flute Test\nCarlos Silva featuring Nelson Freitas and Eddy Parker – Mystery\nDJ Raymundo – Come On\nMelvin Reese – All Day All Night\nGraffiti6 – Stare in to The Sun\nNicky Romero – Growl\nSoltrenz Soundstage, Kelvin Scott – Jump All Night\nNSF – It's Whatever You Want\nMelleefresh vs. Deadmau5 – BRH\nMelvin Reese featuring Sunnery James and Ryan Marciano – Lift U Up\nMayra Veronica – Mama Mia\nIrina – One Last Kiss\nLeah Labelle – Lolita\nVox Halo featuring LaDolla – Criminal\nAsher Monroe – Here With You\nDanny Avila – Breaking Your Fall\nDimitri Vangelis and Wyman featuring Jonny Rose – Pieces of Light\n\n\n== Websites ==\nOfficial website\n\n\n== References =="

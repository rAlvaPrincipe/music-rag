    "text": "Raptori was a Finnish rap group, formed in 1989 in Hyvinkää. They were pioneers of Finnish rap music.\nRaptori were aggressive and humoristic at once, often using counter-intuitive rhymes. During the last years of the 1990s dozens of new Finnish rap groups appeared but Raptori was among the first. Raptori's first album, Moe!, was highly successful, selling over 80 000 copies and yielding a number one single (on the Finnish chart) \"Oi Beibi\". After their second album Raptori broke up (or at least left the scene) they came back in 2000 and released their third album. The band made yet another comeback in 2010 and released a new compilation album Sekoelma which included one new song and two remixes of old songs.\nIn the mid-1990s, Ismo Tapio Heikkilä and Juho Peltomaa formed a band called Allekirjoittanut with Tommi Lindell. They have released one album, Generation Å.  A fellow Raptori member, Tero Tapio Kaikkonen, also appeared on that release.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJuho Samuli Peltomaa (JuFo III)\nIsmo Tapio Heikkilä (Izmo)\nTero Tapio Kaikkonen (Kaivo)\n\n\n== Production staff ==\nManne Railo (Mitro), Producer\n\n\n== Releases ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nMoe!

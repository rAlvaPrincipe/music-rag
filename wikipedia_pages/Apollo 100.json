    "text": "Apollo 100 was a British instrumental group that had a U.S. Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hit with the Bachâ€“inspired single \"Joy\" in 1972.\n\n\n== History ==\nApollo 100 was founded by arranger and multi-instrumentalist Tom Parker, who was known for his arrangements from the Young Blood catalogue, such as the Top 20 American hit \"Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep\" and a number of Don Fardon's recordings. Parker had played keyboards, clarinet, saxophone, trumpet, trombone and a number of other instruments from an early age, and entered the music industry as a session musician by the 1960s. In the intervening time, he associated with a number of groups, including The Mark Leeman 5, Jimmy James and the Vagabonds and Eric Burdon with the New Animals.\nParker formed Apollo 100 in the latter part of 1971 with fellow session musicians drummer Clem Cattini, guitarist Vic Flick, guitarist Zed Jenkins, percussionist Jim Lawless, and bassist Brian Odgers. In December 1971, they released their first single, \"Joy\", an electrified arrangement by Clive Scott of Bach's \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\". The single rose to number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. None of their subsequent efforts was as successful, and they broke up in 1973.\nParker went on to form the New London Chorale.\n\n\n== Soundtrack appearances ==\n\"Joy\" has been featured on the soundtracks of the films Boogie Nights, One Day in September and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, as well as the television series The Man Who Fell to Earth. While not featured on the Battle of the Sexes soundtrack, the song is heard during a scene in the film and is cited in the end credits.\n\n\n== Charting discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

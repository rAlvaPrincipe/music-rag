The group debuted on April 19, 2011, with the extended play (EP) Seven Springs of Apink. Apink currently consists of five members: Chorong, Bomi, Eunji, Namjoo, and Hayoung. Originally a septet, Yookyung left in 2013 due to educational pursuits and Naeun left to persue her acting career in 2022.\nSince their debut, Apink has won awards at shows such as the Golden Disc Awards, the Seoul Music Awards and the Mnet Asian Music Awards. Their first music program win was on M Countdown on January 5, 2012, for \"My My\" from their second EP Snow Pink. To date, Apink has released nine Korean EPs, five Korean studio albums, and three Japanese studio albums.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut ===\nIn February 2011, A Cube Entertainment announced the first trainee for new girl group Apink was Son Na-eun, who featured in Beast's \"Soom\" (숨; \"Breath\"), \"Beautiful\" and \"Niga Jeil Joha\" (니가 제일 좋아; \"I Like You the Best\") music videos in late 2010. Park Cho-rong, who appeared at the end of Beast's \"Shock\" Japanese music video, joined next, as the group's leader. A Cube announced Oh Ha-young as the third member. In March, Jeong Eun-ji was introduced as the fourth member on A Cube's Twitter account through a video of her singing a rendition of Jennifer Hudson's \"Love You I Do\". Hong Yoo-kyung was similarly announced through an online video where she was playing the piano. The last two members, Yoon Bo-mi and Kim Nam-joo, were introduced through the group's reality show, Apink News.\nPrior to the group's debut, the documentary Apink News aired on the Korean cable channel Trend E. The show chronicled the launch process of Apink. The episodes were hosted by various celebrities, including G.NA, Mario, MBLAQ's Seung Ho and G.O, Beast, 4Minute, 2AM's Jinwoon, and Secret's Sunhwa and Hyoseong. The week before Apink's official debut, they released their first television commercial for Ceylon Tea.\n\n\n=== 2011: Debut, rising success and further releases ===\n\nThe group released their debut EP, Seven Springs of Apink, and the music video for its lead single, \"Mollayo\" (몰라요; \"I Don't Know\"), on April 19, 2011.

The song peaked at number six on Gaon's weekly chart. Their fourth EP, Pink Blossom, and the music video for its title track, \"Mr. Chu\", by Duble Sidekick, were released on March 31. The song peaked at number two on Billboard's K-Pop Hot 100.

During the showcase, leader Cho-rong stated that Pink Revolution would incorporate a new sense of Apink's growth and maturity since debut, while Eun-ji explained that Apink will begin to focus on making complex and beautiful music, rather than tracks that \"are simply fun and catchy.\" Apink promoted \"Only One\" and Pink Revolution for nearly a month, and the album has since sold 50,000+ copies in South Korea. In November, Apink began their Pink Aurora Asia Tour, performing at numerous destinations throughout eastern Asia including Taiwan and Singapore.

On July 2, Apink released their seventh mini-album One & Six. The title track, \"I'm So Sick\" (Korean: 1도 없어), was used to promote the album along with B-track \"Alright\". Once again, Apink worked with frequent collaborator Black Eyed Pilseung for the title track, who had previously produced \"Only One\". With this comeback, Apink took on a different direction conceptually, with a bolder image and a more sophisticated sound. \"I'm So Sick\" topped several music charts in South Korea after its release. The album itself topped the Gaon chart and led Apink to reach their highest-ever position on Billboard's World Albums chart at number 11. The success of the song and album further led to Apink making their debut on Billboard's Social 50 chart, opening at number 39. Billboard chose the title track as one of the 20 Best K-Pop Songs of 2018, noting that \"it felt a bit meta -- as the six-member girl group swapped out their girlish image for something far more compelling.\". In August, Apink embarked on another Asia tour, visiting Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Singapore, Tokyo and Taipei. On December 1, Apink received the Top 10 Artists award at the 2018 Melon Music Awards for their song \"I'm So Sick\".\n\nApink held their fifth Korean concert Pink Collection: Red and White in Seoul on January 5 and 6.

On January 7, Apink released their eighth mini-album Percent, along with the single \"%%(Eung Eung)\", composed by frequent collaborator Black Eyed Pilseung and Jeon Goon. The single, which continued the new direction taken by the group with \"I'm So Sick\", topped several music charts in South Korea after its release and peaked at number 17 on the Gaon digital chart, while the album reached number three on the Korean chart and number 14 on the Billboard World Albums chart. To promote the new album, Apink performed \"%%(Eung Eung)\" on various music shows, along with B-side track \"Hug Me\", for a period of two weeks beginning on January 9. To celebrate their 8th anniversary, Apink released the digital single \"Everybody Ready?\" dedicated to fans on April 19.\nOn March 13, 2020, Play M Entertainment announced that Apink would be making a comeback some time in April. On April 13, Apink released their ninth mini-album Look, as well as the single, \"Dumhdurum\". \"Dumhdurum\" was composed and written by Black Eyed Pilseung and Jeon Goon, who worked on their previous songs \"I'm So Sick\" and \"%%(Eung Eung)\". Upon release, the song topped four major realtime charts in South Korea and became their first song to reach number one on Melon in 5 years, since \"Remember\". To promote the new album, Apink performed \"Dumhdurum\" on various music shows, along with B-side tracks \"Be Myself\", \"Love is Blind\" and \"Moment\" for a period of two weeks beginning on April 17. \"Look\" debuted at number two on the Gaon Album Chart while \"Dumhdurum\" peaked at number two on the Digital Chart, giving the group their ninth top 10 single. \"Dumhdurum\" was also ranked second on Billboard's list of the top K-pop songs of 2020.\n\n\n=== 2021–present: 10th anniversary, Naeun's departure, new sub-unit and contract renewals ===\n\nTo celebrate their 10th anniversary, Apink released the new digital single \"Thank You\" on April 19, 2021. On April 29, 2021, Play M Entertainment announced that member Naeun decided to not renew her contract with the company, while the other five members renewed with the agency. Despite the change of agency, the company assured fans that Apink would remain a six-member group. In December, IST Entertainment announced that Apink would make their comeback in February 2022.  On February 14, 2022, Apink released their fourth studio album Horn, as well as the lead single \"Dilemma\".\nOn April 8, 2022, it was reported that Naeun would be withdrawing from the group due to difficulty balancing work as both an actress and idol. This was later confirmed by IST Entertainment via the group's fancafe. On April 19, Apink released a new digital single titled \"I Want You To Be Happy\" to celebrate their 11th anniversary. In June, IST Entertainment announced that Chorong and Bomi will be forming Apink's new sub-unit called \"ChoBom\", and will be releasing their first single album Copycat on July 12.\nOn March 14, 2023, confirmed the release of Apink's 10th mini album SELF, which was released on April 5. On April 28, IST Entertainment announced that all the members, except Eunji, did not renew their contracts with the company but team activities will be maintained. On that same day, it was also announced that Chorong, Bomi, Namjoo and Hayoung signed with Choi Creative Lab.\n\n\n== Image and musical style ==\n\nApink's image and music style are often compared to first-generation idol girl groups S.E.S. and Fin.K.L. Apink has an innocent and girlish image, unusual among girl groups' sexy concepts. In 2012, youngest member Hayoung stated, \"Other girl groups these days tend to highlight their dancing skills and sexy looks, but our concept was an innocent and pure image. I think that's why the audience felt comfortable with us\". However, releases like 2014's \"Luv\" and 2015's \"Remember\" showed a more mature and sensitive side to the group while still retaining their trademark innocence.\nApink's music generally fits within the bubblegum pop genre, with signature cheery lyrics. Jeff Benjamin of Billboard commented that \"My My\" recalled early 2000s bubblegum pop, \"NoNoNo\" was influenced by 1980s synth-pop and \"Luv\" recalls 1990s hip-hop while blending it with ballad melancholy, a fall-themed song of lost love. \"Mr. Chu\", released in spring 2014, continues Apink's trademark bubblegum series which is 'very Apink'. Meanwhile, title track \"Remember\" is a 'cheery synth-pop tune that reminisces about a love during the summertime,' and 'features a quick rhythm and vintage sound to beat the summer heat,'. Their 2016 title track, \"Only One\" is described as mature, blending in mid tempo R&B and dance-pop with subtle hip-hop beats while song like \"Boom Pow Love\" shows a far more urban-pop, energetic vibe with pulsing beats compared to their previous hits.\nWith the release of 2018's \"I'm So Sick\", Apink showed a shift in their style of music, moving towards a more mature and sophisticated sound. The track, with its use of autotune, synth and house beats, and its lyrical content of having 'not even one' bit of feeling left for an ex, makes \"I'm So Sick\" a much bolder track than what Apink is known to put out. 2019's \"%%(Eung Eung)\" does much of the same. Its use of 'fizzy synths, snapping beats, and slapping percussion as the members sing about the type of person one should love' makes \"%%(Eung Eung)\" another song that is a departure from much of Apink's earlier work.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAdapted from their Naver profile:\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Ambassadorship ==\n2021 COEX Food Week Ambassador (2021)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Concerts and tours ==\n\nKorean Tours\n\nPink Paradise (2015)\nPink Island (2015)\nPink Party (2016)\nPink Space (2018)\nPink Collection: Red and White (2019)\nWelcome to Pink World (2020)\nPink Eve: 10 Years (2021)\nJapan Tours\n\nApink 1st Live Tour – Pink Season (2015)\nApink 2nd Live Tour – Pink Summer (2016)\nApink 3rd Live Tour – 3 Years (2017)\nApink Japan Live Pink Collection (2019)\nAsia Tours \n\nApink Secret Garden in Singapore – Vizit Korea (2013)\nPink Paradise Asia Tour (2015)\nApink Pink Memory Day In Singapore Mini Concert & Fan Meeting (2016)\nPink Aurora Asia Tour (2016–2017)\nPink Up Asia Tour (2017)\nOne & Six Asia Tour (2018)\nPink Drive (2023)\nAmerican Tours\n\nPink Memory: Apink North America Tour (2016)\nOnline Stage\n\nPink of the Year (2020)\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\nApink started with a documentary program titled Apink News, which aired on the cable channel TrendE for three seasons (2011–2012).

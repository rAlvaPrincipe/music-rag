    "text": "Slovenly were an American post-punk band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1981. After the group disbanded, Tom Watson joined Red Krayola for their self-titled album and has continued to record with them.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe members of Slovenly had all attended Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach. Steve Anderson, Scott Ziegler and drummer Bruce Lossen were in a band called the Convalescence. When the bass player left, Watson joined and the band name was changed to Toxic Shock.\nAfter graduation, they continued playing music and the initial version of Slovenly was formed. Eventually, Bruce left the band and was replaced by ex-Saccharine Trust drummer Rob Holzman.\nThe band played their first gig as Toxic Shock with Minutemen and Saccharine Trust which led to an invitation from the Urinals to contribute a track to the Keats Rides A Harley compilation album by Happy Squid Records. The band changed their name to Slovenly and continued to gig with Minutemen which led to releasing their first albums on Mike Watt's New Alliance Records label.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nAfter the Original Style (1984, New Alliance)\nThinking of Empire (1986, SST)\nRiposte (1987, SST)\nWe Shoot for the Moon (1989, SST)\nHighway to Hanno's (1992, SST)\nEPs\nEven So (1984, New Alliance)\nPlug (1986, New Alliance)\nDrive It Home, Abbernathy (1991, Ajax)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSlovenly at AllMusic\nSlovenly discography at Discogs"

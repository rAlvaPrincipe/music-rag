    "text": "Video Game Orchestra (VGO) is a Boston-based project that performs its own \"rockestral\" arrangements of video game music with a rock band, vocals, and orchestra. The project was created by Shota Nakama, a Boston-based producer from Okinawa, Japan. Comparative to the other existing major video game concert acts, which mostly focus on the pure orchestral performances, the rock band element is the core essence of the VGO. Their concerts are presented as a rock show with entertaining audience engagement and improvised solos.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and debut ===\nVideo Game Orchestra was founded by Shota Nakama, a graduate from Berklee College of Music and The Boston Conservatory, in May 2008.\nVGO became comprised by a group of Boston-based professional musicians, assembled by Shota himself. His own intentions with the group was to deliver something very different and fresh to the world. VGO's debut concert, A Night of Symphonic Video Game Music, was held at Gordon Chapel in Old South Church in Boston on July 2, 2008.  The orchestra, or rather a small ensemble of 28 musicians including Shota himself playing the guitar, performed the music from popular titles such as Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana, and Metal Gear Solid. Their second concert was held at Church of the Covenant of Boston on November 2, 2008, which also saw the addition of a full rock band and choir.\n\n\n=== The ensemble ===\nVideo Games Orchestra comprises a group of musicians, both young and established talents from local communities, as well as talents from around the world.

In attendance were four of America's most prolific video game composers, Jack Wall, Gerard Marino, Duncan Watt, and Keith Zizza with Wall conducting his own compositions with the VGO. It received heavy promotion and the orchestra was featured on NECN News, Boston Globe, and numerous other papers, radio stations, and websites around the world.\nOn May 7, 2009, Independent Game Conference hosted VGO as its closing event and was held at Fenway Center in Boston.  This concert featured the VGO chamber group outfit for the first time in a very intimate acoustic setting.\nThe group was asked to perform at Anime Boston as the opening act for the main musical guest, Kalafina and Yuki Kajiura.

    "text": "Melt-Banana is a Japanese noise rock band that is known for playing extremely fast noise rock and hardcore punk mixed with experimental, electronica and pop-based song structures. Since forming in 1992 the band has released ten albums and toured worldwide extensively.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1991, while attending Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Yasuko Onuki started a band called Mizu and, after a short period rehearsing with another guitarist, recruited Ichiro Agata to play guitar in the band. Mizu's original drummer and bass player quit six months after Agata joined, leaving Yasuko to handle the bass and vocal duties until she found bassist Rika. They briefly performed shows around Tokyo without a drummer. Sudoh Toshiaki then joined as the new drummer in November 1992, and they changed their name to Melt-Banana.\nIn May 1993, Melt-Banana played a show opening for KK Null of Zeni Geva fame, who was impressed enough to immediately offer them a deal with his label, and would later introduce them to Mark Fischer of Skin Graft Records and Steve Albini.\nIn 1996, sick Zip Everywhere was nominated for MTV UK's best video. In the same year the band completed their first European tour.\nIn 1997, they created their own recording company, A-Zap (formerly Iguana Coax), and re-issued most of their early albums. Around this time, drummer Sudoh Toshiaki quit. Oshima Watchma became the new official drummer in February 1998.\nThe band recorded its first Peel Session in September 1999. Onuki thought John Peel looked like Santa Claus; Agata has said that when finishing a new song, he still thinks of Peel and what he would think of it if he listened. Peel described the session as \"Simply one of the most extraordinary performances I have ever seen and ever heard ... just mesmerizing, absolutely astonishing.\" The broadcast exposed the band to new audiences in the United Kingdom and beyond.\nWatchma left the band in 2000, and since then the band has had different drummers on their tours and albums.\nIn 2007, Melt-Banana recorded the song \"Hair-Cat (Cause the Wolf Is a Cat!)\" for Perfect Hair Forever on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim lineup.\nThe studio album Fetch, released September 2013, saw the band transition to a duo. The decision not to use a live drummer led on to the decision not to have a live bass player. Using a computer for the rhythm allowed more freedom in the arrangement. Hamamoto's help was not needed for the new duo format. Additionally, throughout the band's career Agata and Onuki had been the main songwriters.\nIn late 2019, during an interview conducted on tour, with Louder magazine, the band stated they would record a new album. A new studio album titled \"3+5\" was announced on May 23, 2024 and released on August 23, 2024.\n\n\n== Style ==\n\nMelt-Banana's music is typically described as noise rock, with roots in punk, grindcore, electro-pop and electronic music. The band has shied away from any classification, saying they \"don't write music according to genre\", and has described their music as \"like a chimera\". Melt-Banana has cited The Sex Pistols, Einstürzende Neubauten, Masonna, Violent Onsen Geisha, Aphex Twin and Atari Teenage Riot as influences, as well as the compilation album No New York. Agata also gets inspiration from the feelings of excitement, triumph and peril he experiences when playing video games, and interpreting that musically. He believes that influences from outside music, including video games, help them see from fresh angles and keep them from writing \"the same kind of music again and again\". Games he has cited as an inspiration include Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, Ecco the Dolphin, Demon's Souls and Shadow of the Colossus.\nOnuki's distinctive vocal style has been described as \"loud, piercing and unexpectedly authoritative\". Asked about her influences, Onuki explained: \"there is no tradition and no influence besides maybe Lydia Lunch and the Teenage Jerks. She opened a new book for me. It was so unique and distinctive, you could tell by listening to the voice who is singing – that what I wanted to achieve with my own voice too.\"\nAlthough the band is Japanese, their lyrics are written in English. Onuki originally sung in Japanese, but quickly changed to English, believing that it was better suited to her style of singing. Because English is not her native language, Onuki often has to look words up in dictionaries, which also allows her to find words that sound interesting to her. In writing a song, Onuki typically starts with particular words and then works backwards, the content of which comes from what she \"see[s] and feel[s] in [her] usual life\".\nAgata is noted for his distinct style of guitar playing that involves heavy use of effects and pedals.\nThe band is known for playing an \"eclectic\" selection of cover songs, both live and on studio recordings. Melt-Banana was inspired to do so after touring with Mr. Bungle and seeing them perform several cover songs, and thinking it would be fun for both the audience and the band themselves. Songs that Melt-Banana has covered include \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" (The Beach Boys), \"Neat Neat Neat\" (The Damned) and \"Paint It Black\" (The Rolling Stones). In choosing the songs, Melt-Banana simply \"play songs that [they] like.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nYasuko Onuki – vocals (1992–present)\nIchiro Agata – guitars, effects (1992–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\n\n\n==== Bass ====\nFrom 2013 onward the band does not have a bass player.\n\nRika Hamamoto (1992–2013)\n\n\n==== Drums ====\nMelt-Banana does not currently have an official drummer.

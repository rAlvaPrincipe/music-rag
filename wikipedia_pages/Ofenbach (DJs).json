Their gold-certified song \"Be Mine\" charted on the Billboard Dance/Mix Show Airplay reached number 35. After releasing songs like \"Around the Fire\" and \"You Don't Know Me\", they gained support from artists such as Robin Schulz and Tiësto. They are also known for remixing songs from Bob Sinclar, Hyphen Hyphen, and James Bay.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe duo met at school at an early age. When they were 13 years old, Lo's father told them that one of the best experiences of his life was being part of a band. This inspired them to form their first musical group in which they performed rock music. They cite some of their influences as Supertramp, The Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin.\nThe name Ofenbach was selected after the duo found a score by French composer Jacques Offenbach at their home.\nOfenbach released their single \"Be Mine\" alongside an official remix package via Warner Music France/Big Beat, which featured remixes from Agrume, Antiyu, and Stone Van Brooken. The song peaked at number one in Russia and Poland.\nAnd also, they have performed at 2018 UEFA Europa League Final opening ceremony in Lyon\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n\n2014\n\nMiriam Makeba – \"Pata Pata\" ((Ofenbach Remix)\nAndreas Moe – \"Under the Sun\" (Ofenbach Remix)\nJames Bay – \"Hold Back the River\" (Ofenbach Remix)\n2015\n\nLily & Madeleine – \"Come to Me\" (Ofenbach Remix)\n2016\n\nShem Thomas – \"We Just Need a Little\" (Ofenbach Remix)\n2017\n\nJames Blunt – \"Love Me Better\" (Ofenbach Remix)\nPortugal.

    "text": "Tommy Lefroy is an indie rock duo based in London, England, consisting of Canadian singer Tessa Mouzourakis and American singer Wynter Bethel. They received a Juno Award nomination in the Breakthrough Group of the Year category at the 2023 ceremony.\nThe duo first met in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S., in 2017, where both were trying to establish themselves as professional songwriters. They began working together in 2018 after Bethel was exposed to Mouzourakis's online cover of \"Ketchum, ID\" by boygenius. The name \"Tommy Lefroy\" is a reference to Thomas Langlois Lefroy, an Irish politician who is thought to be an inspiration for the character of Mr. Darcy in Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice.\nAfter collaborating on songwriting and learning record production, they began releasing singles in 2021, breaking through to wider success when their single \"The Cause\" became popular on TikTok.\nThey released their debut EP Flight Risk in November 2021. They signed to Pheromone Recordings in 2022, and put out the non-album single \"Dog Eat Dog\" as their first release for the label.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nEPs\nFlight Risk (2021)\nRivals (2023)\nborn blue (2024)\n\n\n== References =="

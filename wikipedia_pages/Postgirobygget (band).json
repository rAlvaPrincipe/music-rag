They never really intended to play as a \"proper\" band with their own songs, but their live playings created such a passionate fan base that they kept going. As they eventually needed more material to play, the band started playing songs featured on vocalist Arne Hurlén's demo CDs. Realising they had become the \"real\" band they never intended, the band soon renamed themselves Postgirobygget.\nThey recorded their first album in 1996 with the title Melis.\n\n\n== Line-up ==\nArne Hurlén - guitarist and vocals (1996-)\nNicolai Hauan - bass and chorus (2009-)\nNils Petter Time - guitarist and chorus (1996-)\nØyvind Kolset - keyboards and harmonica (1996-)\nPer Sarin Madsen - Drums, percussion and chorus (1999-)\nGunnar Westgaard - bass and chorus (1996–2008)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nPostirobygget.no\nPostgirobyget's Twitter\n\n\n== References =="

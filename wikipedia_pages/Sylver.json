    "text": "Sylver is a Belgian Eurodance and pop group, originally consisting of lead vocalist Silvy De Bie (born 4 January 1981), DJ and producer Regi Penxten (born 4 March 1976), and keyboardist/songwriter Wout Van Dessel (born 19 October 1974). They were active from 2000 until 2014, when De Bie decided to focus on her solo career, but they returned in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2000–02: Career beginnings and \"Chances\" ===\n\nThe band was formed in 2000 as \"Liquid feat. Silvy\" and released the single \"Turn the Tide\" in France and Belgium. The single was released in the rest of Europe in 2001 under the band's new name, \"Sylver.\" In Germany, the single quickly rose to number 8 in the charts, and within eight weeks reached number 2 (behind Atomic Kitten's \"Whole Again\"), staying in the top 10 for 12 weeks. The debut album \"Chances\" followed a month later, debuting at number 16 and spending 49 weeks in the top 100, making it Sylver's most successful studio album to date. Follow-up singles \"Forever In Love\", \"In Your Eyes,\" and \"Forgiven\" also charted successfully. In 2001, \"Skin\" was released exclusively in Belgium, while in 2002, \"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\" was released as the sixth and final single, only in Spain, where it peaked at number 5.\n\n\n=== 2003–05: \"Little Things\" and \"Nighttime Calls\" ===\nIn 2003, the second album Little Things was released with similar success, peaking at number 7 on the Belgian album charts. It featured the hit singles \"Livin' My Life\" and \"Why Worry.\" Other singles from the album included the double A-side \"Shallow Water\"/\"Confused,\" and the fourth and final single \"Wild Horses,\" which was released in Belgium and Germany in 2003, though with limited success. On 2 November 2004, the third studio album Nighttime Calls was released. It became Sylver's least successful studio album to date, peaking at only number 23 on the Belgian album charts. The album's first single, \"Love is an Angel,\" entered the Belgian top 10 immediately upon its release on 20 September. In 2005, the follow-up singles \"Make It\" and \"Take Me Back\" were released, achieving moderate success in Belgium and Germany, respectively.\n\n\n=== 2006–07: \"Crossroads\" and \"The Hit Collection\" ===\nThe fourth studio album, Crossroads, was released in May 2006. The major hit was \"Lay All Your Love On Me,\" a cover of ABBA, marking Sylver's first-ever cover version single release, which peaked at number 5 on the Belgian singles chart. From this point onward, in addition to using the synthesizer and drum machine, Sylver incorporated guitar, piano, and various percussion instruments, resulting in a more mature pop sound. Follow-up singles \"One Night Stand\" and \"Why\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively. In 2007, the band's first compilation album, \"Best Of – The Hit Collection 2001–2007,\" was released, featuring \"The One\" as its sole single, which peaked at number 4 on the Belgian singles chart.\n\n\n=== 2008–09: \"Sacrifice\" and Addition of John Miles Jr. ===\nIn 2008, the singles \"One World, One Dream\" and \"Rise Again\" were released. In 2009, Sylver added English guitarist John Miles Jr. as their third band member. He had previously been part of the popular Belgian group Milk Inc.. As a trio, they released three more songs: \"I Hate You Now,\" a cover of Mike Oldfield's \"Foreign Affair,\" and \"Music,\" which was originally by John Miles Jr.'s father, John Miles, and also featured John Miles as a guest artist. Sylver's fifth studio album, Sacrifice, was released on 8 May 2009 exclusively in Belgium, where it peaked at number 3 on the album charts. The album won the band the TMF award for \"Best Domestic Album\" in 2009.\n\n\n=== 2010–12: \"Decade\" and Single Releases ===\nIn 2010, Sylver released their second compilation album, \"Decade – The Very Best Of Sylver,\" to celebrate their 10th anniversary, with \"It's My Life\" being the only single from the album. The album peaked at number 1 on the Belgian album charts, becoming Sylver's most successful album in Belgium, while the single achieved a top 20 spot on the Belgian singles chart. In addition to their anniversary, Sylver released a new version of their debut single, \"Turn the Tide.\" In 2011 and 2012, the singles \"Stop Feeling Sorry\" and \"City Of Angels\" were released as standalone singles. These two songs mark the final releases featuring original lead vocalist Silvy De Bie (aka Seeley's Girl), who would leave the band the following year after thirteen years.\n\n\n=== 2014: Departure of De Bie and Hiatus ===\nThe group's original lead vocalist, Silvy De Bie, left the band in early 2014, leaving the band without a vocalist and facing an uncertain future, which led the band to go on a temporary hiatus.\n\n\n=== 2016 Return ===\nIn the spring of 2016, the band officially announced their reunion and began writing new material. In 2017, they released the single \"Turn Your Love Around\".  \nIn October 2019, Sylver released the single \"I Won't Wait\" and announced their \"Sylver Lining Tour 2020,\" featuring a full live band to celebrate their 20-year anniversary. The tour was set to kick off at Concertzaal Casino in Sint-Niklaas, Belgium on 20 March 2020.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website"

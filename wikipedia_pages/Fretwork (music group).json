In 2023 the members were listed on the website as Emily Ashton, Emilia Benjamin, Richard Boothby, Joanna Levine, Jonathan Rees and Sam Stadlen. Among those who have performed with the group are the singers Catherine Bott, James Bowman and Michael Chance, the instrumentalists Paul Nicholson and Christopher Wilson, and the Red Byrd vocal ensemble.\nThe group has published a number of editions of music for consort of viols, and also a book by David Pinto on the consort and dance music of William Lawes.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\n\n1997: French Grand Prix du Disque for Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares by John Dowland\n2009: Gramophone Award for 'Purcell: Complete Fantazias' (by Henry Purcell) on Harmonia Mundi\n2016: Royal Philharmonic Society 'Chamber Music & Song' Award\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nIn Nomine, 1987\nHeart's Ease, 1988\nArmada, 1988\nCries and Fancies by Orlando Gibbons, 1989\nNight's Black Bird by John Dowland and William Byrd, 1989\nGoe nightly cares by John Dowland and William Byrd, 1990\nLachrimae by John Dowland, 1990\nFor ye Violls by William Lawes, 1991\nMusic for Viols, 1992\nA Play of Passion, 1992\nThe English Viol, 1994 (compilation album)\nWilliam Byrd: The Complete Consort Music by William Byrd, 1994\nHenry Purcell: The Fantazias and In Nomines by Henry Purcell, 1995\nConcord is conquer'd by William Lawes, 1995\nMatthew Locke: Consort of Fower Parts by Matthew Locke, 1996\nThe Mirrour and Wonder of his Age by John Jenkins, 1996\nSit Fast, 1997\nCelestiall Witchcraft, 1999\nMissa 'Mater Christi sanctissima' by John Taverner, 2000\nThe Hidden Face by John Tavener and John Taverner, 2001\nHarmonice Musices Odhecaton compiled by Ottaviano Petrucci, 2001\nThe Art of Fugue by J.S.

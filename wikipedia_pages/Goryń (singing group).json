    "text": "Goryń is a Belarusian singing group.\n\n\n== History ==\nGoryń was formed in 2008 by members of the Students' Ethnographic Association. The group has a diverse knowledge of music and had performed more than 20 times as of late 2014. \nWhile touring rural parts of Belarus, Goryń chose to perform without arrangements and incorporated specific features of regional dialect and singing styles in their performances. Their repertoire consists of songs from the Paleśsie region as well as from Central and Northern Belarus. The group attempts to preserve traditional culture in various urban environments, through the revival of regional festivals.\n\n\n== Origin of the group's name ==\nThe word goryń was used in Belarus at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries to describe the red cotton embroidery threads often sold by Jews and Gypsies in Belarusian villages.  The word comes from the German garn, which means \"yarn\". \n\nThe word \"goryń\", \"garyna\" or \"gorynka\" is still used in some parts of Belarus and the red woven threads have become symbolic and meaningful in national Belarusian costume alongside its musical associations.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Da padaj, Boža, klučy...

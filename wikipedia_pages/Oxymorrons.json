    "text": "Oxymorrons are an American rap rock band from Queens, New York, consisting of vocalist Demi \"Deee\"  and brother Kami \"KI\" drummer Matty Mayz and vocalist/guitarist/bassist Jafe Paulino.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOxymorrons began as a collaboration between Queens-bred brothers, Kami (K.I.) and Demi (Deee), who joined forces to create a hip hop and rock fusion act. After years spent playing and touring with other groups, the brothers decided it was time to set the New York scene ablaze with their sonic creations. The lineup expanded with the addition of staple drummer Matty Mayz, whose blistering talent alongside Vocalist/bassist/guitarist Jafe Paulino has become an intricate part of the bands live show. The genre-blending masterminds use their musical platform to speak for, and to, the rejected. Their message of embracing ones individuality resonates with their fellow underdogs.\nThey have played in many festivals including SXSW, Firefly, and AfroPunk, while they have made partnerships with artists including Ludacris, Juicy J, Bruno Mars, and Rihanna.\nThe band released \"Brunch\" as the first single from their next project on February 2, 2018. VIBE dubbed them \"The Mash Out Posse\" for their clash of hip-hop, rock, funk and alternative sounds.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nDave \"D\" Bellevue - Vocals\nAshmy \"KI\" Bellevue - Vocals\nMatty Mayz - Drums\nJafe Paulino - Vocals/Bass/Guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\nMohawks and Durags (June 2021)\nComplex But Basic (October 2016)\nMelanin Punk (October 20, 2023)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

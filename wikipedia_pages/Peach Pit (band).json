    "text": "Peach Pit is a Canadian indie pop band formed in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2016. The band consists of singer and rhythm guitarist Neil Smith, lead guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy, bassist Peter Wilton, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi. Lately they have been joined by multi-instrumentalist Dougal Bain McLean on synth, guitar, and fiddle. They describe their own music as \"chewed bubblegum pop\", whereas critics have described their sound as sad pop, and surf rock and is characterized by a soft spoken vocal style and guitar-driven rock melodies. The band's music videos are produced by videographer Lester Lyons-Hookham. The band sported the same clothes for every live performance during their \"Being So Normal\" album phase after buying them for their first music video shoot.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group formed when high school friends, Neil Smith and Chris Vanderkooy, decided to collaborate on a musical project in 2014. Peter Wilton and Mikey Pascuzzi joined them on bass and drums. In June 2016, the band released its debut EP, Sweet FA. They quickly began work on their follow up release and debut LP, Being So Normal. It was released in September 2017 on the Vancouver indie label Kingfisher Bluez.'\nVocalist/rhythm guitarist Neil Smith was formerly part of the folk band Dogwood and Dahlia. Smith and bassist Peter Wilton formerly worked as Amazon delivery drivers, guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy worked at a local Vancouver brewery, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi worked as a carpenter. Following the success of their debut album, the band quit their jobs to go on their first tour of North America, Europe and Asia from 2017 to 2018. Peach Pit embarked on several tours, both nationally and internationally, to promote their music and connect with fans. They have performed at renowned festivals such as SXSW and Osheaga, and have shared the stage with notable acts like Mac DeMarco and Dayglow. They have been touring steadily ever since the release of their debut album.\nPeach Pit performed at Bonnaroo, Shaky Knees Music Festival, CBC Music Festival, and Capitol Hill Block Party in 2019 and opened for Two Door Cinema Club in a tour of the U.S. and Canada in 2019. In April of 2020, the band released their highly anticipated sophomore album, \"You and Your Friends.\" This album showcased a more mature sound while retaining their trademark laid-back charm. Tracks like \"Feelin' Low (F*ckboy Blues)\" and \"Shampoo Bottles\" received significant radio airplay and gained popularity on streaming platforms. Their third studio album, From 2 to 3, was released on March 4, 2022. They have performed in Chicago, Illinois for Lollapalooza in August 2023.

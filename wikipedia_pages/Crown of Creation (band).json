    "text": "Crown of Creation is a band from Hanover, Germany. The band developed its own musical style: pop music with strong trance influences.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCrown of Creation was founded in 1985. The band’s name was inspired by the album Crown of Creation by Jefferson Airplane.\nThe band began in Großmoor (part of the municipality of Adelheidsdorf) and moved to Hanover in 1987. After numerous line-up changes and many recordings, the band went into the studio of Rick J. Jordan (Scooter) in 1993 with Nicole Sukar and recorded, with the help of the record producer Herman Frank (Victory), their first CD Real Life. Following that release in 1994, Olaf Oppermann was the band's guitarist.\nIn 1994 and 1995, the band was in the French département of Seine-et-Marne, near Paris, on tour. In 1998, the band dissolved. Eleven years later, Crown of Creation came together again in 2009, with a new singer, Anne Crönert.\nIn 2010, the CD EP Darkness in your Life was produced and, in conjunction with the Dance Factory from Lachendorf, a video was developed. In May 2010, over several weeks, a series ran with the story of Crown of Creation in the Wathlinger Bote and the Wathlinger Echo, which presented the facts and news from the past 25 years. \nFor Christmas 2010, the band gave their hometown of Hanover the song \"At Christmas Time\".\nThe children’s choir of the primary school of Adelheidsdorf performed with the band in August 2011 in a studio in Hanover to sing the chorus of \"Child's Eyes\" with three German-language passages. In 2012, Crown of Creation contributed a new and unreleased song to the charity compilation Made in Ce(lle) in support of the children's hospice work and even worked with the lead in the production and marketing of the sampler.\nIn 2013, the CD maxi With the Rhythm in my Mind was released. On this occasion, the video production company emovion produced the video of the main title and another one of the songs, \"Child’s Eyes\". \nOn August 18, 2015, Hofa GmbH label released the best of album Best of Crown of Creation 1985–2015, a double CD with songs from the original albums, unreleased tracks, special mixes and live recordings.\nIn 2024, the CD maxi Everlasting Love was released, a fine song in the Crown of Creation catalog, showcasing the distinctive voice of Lara-Malin Blazek. \n\n\n== Band members ==\nMatthias \"Matze\" Blazek (synthesizer)\nThomas Czacharowski (synthesizer)\n\n\n== Former members ==\nMichaela Rutsch (voice – 1986)\nBobby / Anja Wieneke (voice – until 1987)\nSabine Mertens (voice 1987–1988 and 1990)\nMustafa \"Mussi\" Akkuzu (guitar 1987–1988)\nFrank Pokrandt (voice 1988)\nClaudia Rohde (voice 1988–1989)\nAndreas Harms (guitar 1988–1989)\nThomas Richter (bass 1988–1989)\nDirk Schmalz (guitar 1989)\nAngela Thies (voice 1990)\nMartin Zwiener (synthesizer 1992)\nNicole Sukar (voice 1992–1994)\nNicole Knauer (voice 1993–1998)\nOlaf \"Oppi\" Oppermann (guitar 1994–2010)\nAnne Crönert (voice 2009–2013)\nAdrian Lesch (synthesizer 1994–2015)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1994: Real Life (ContraPunkt)\n1998: Crown of Creation meets Friends (self published)\n2001: Paulinchen (with Memory)\n2003: Berenstark 10 (with When Time is lost)\n2004: Berenstark 11 (with Friends)\n2010: Abstürzende Brieftauben – TANZEN (with When Time is lost)\n2010: CD EP Darkness in your Life\n2011: W.I.R. präsentiert: Celle's Greatest (with Regrets)\n2012: Celle's Integrationsprojekt präsentiert: Made in Ce (with Run away and the unpublished Vampires in the Moonlight), sampler dedicated to the Children’s hospice in the Landkreis Celle\n2013: CD maxi With the Rhythm in my Mind\n2015: Best of Crown of Creation – 30 Jahre Bandgeschichte 1985–2015\n2019: CD maxi Tebe pojem\n2024: CD maxi Everlasting Love\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMatthias Blazek (2006).

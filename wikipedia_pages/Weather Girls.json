    "text": "Weather Girls is a group of Japanese idols from Taiwan. Originally, the group is formed in 2010 and acted as weather forecasters on television and the internet for Taiwan and the United States. After attracting attention in Japan, seven of its members, one for each day of the week, are selected to debut as an idol group in Japan in 2012. They are the first Taiwanese girl group to come to Japan.\nIn Japan, the group is under Pony Canyon and is managed by Ritz Productions. Jeff Miyahara is the producer of the group. After its debut, the group had continuously performed in all regions of the country. Its members had also starred in dramas, hosted television shows, and sung television theme songs. The group had released six Japanese singles, one Japanese album, and other work.\nIn 2013, the group also debuted as a musical group in Taiwan. The group issued a Mandarin album in the following year. In its homeland, the group is under FEMC and is managed by L Motion Entertainment. Its producer is Bryan Chen (陳國華).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2010–12: weathercasters ===\nDesiring to produce a daily program featuring charming Taiwanese girls, Next TV Broadcasting Limited originated an idea of creating a daily weather forecast program to be distributed through television and the internet, with a group of cute young girls doing cosplay and dancing whilst reporting forecasts.\nOn 1 August 2010, Next TV formed a group of seven girls called \"Weather Girls\". The number of the members is later increased to fourteen and eventually thirty-four. The duties of the girls were to report weather forecasts or, in fact, to \"keep eyes glued on TV sets\", but not to serve as meteorologists. Each day of the week is hosted by a different girl who would introduce herself, dance in costume and deliver a short message to viewers in an adorable manner during the report.\nThe program theme is changed every month. For example, in the graduation theme, the weather reports were filmed at Shih Chien University and the girls dressed up in Japanese school uniforms and spoke in Japanese. The themes of Chinese New Year, company internship, environmentalism, flight attendants, ninja, and tokusatsu had also been used. Furthermore, the costumes, music, and visuals were changed in each theme.\nAs the forecasts were for Taiwan and the United States, the girls spoke in English, Mandarin and Japanese. Lester Shih (奚岳隆), creator of the program, said the Japanese versions were not originally intended for Japanese audience, but merely an expression of Japanese style of cuteness. On television, the forecasts were broadcast daily during the afternoon, evening, and late news.\nRegarding the idea of producing the program, Shih said:\n\nThe weather report was just a means for us to get a daily program together, with the opportunity to show off different girls each day. Currently, we only report on the weather in Taiwan and America, but in the near future we want to add the Japanese weather so we can increase our audience, and maybe even add Thailand and other places around the world.\nSunday Girl NueNue, one of the members later selected to form an idol group in Japan, stated: \"We all learn about it a bit in school [...], though I still don't know too much about weather forecasting.\" According to her, the idea of Next TV was to \"make weather fun\" since \"weather reports are usually dull because it's just someone telling you that it's going to be sunny or it's going to rain, etc.\"\nThe program became highly popular, especially in Japan where it was introduced by many Japanese programs in April 2012. The program was terminated and the group was dissolved after some of its members became an idol group in Japan.\n\n\n=== 2012: debut as idol group in Japan ===\n\n\n==== Debut in Japan ====\nAfter having appeared on Japanese programs in April 2012, the group attracted much attention in Japan. Seven of its members, most skilled in singing and dancing, were then chosen to debut in Japan as an idol group which is also titled \"Weather Girls\". They are the first Taiwanese girl group to come to Japan.\nOn 8 August 2012, the news of Weather Girls debut was officially announced. In Japan, the group was under Pony Canyon and was represented by Ritz Productions. Jeff Miyahara was the producer of the group. At a press conference, a Pony Canyon representative said:\n\nWeather Girls [...] have been born out of Taiwanese culture where so many creators have been influenced by Japanese culture, like games and anime. On top of that, a performance that involves dancing while announcing the weather is fresh and interesting, so the girls have individuality.\nFriday Girl Mini stated: \"I have been fond of Japan since my childhood days and I have been wishing I could live there someday. I have also been longing to become a singer. Being able to fulfill these dreams of mine is such a wonderful feeling.\" Saturday Girl Yumi, leader of the group, added that she and her fellow members wished to appear on the annual music show Kōhaku Uta Gassen (紅白歌合戦) and to become weather forecasters in Japan as well.\nOn 10 August 2012, the group held its debut performance at the A-Nation festival.\nFor their Japanese career, the seven girls were required to take Japanese courses, in addition to dance lessons and performance rehearsals. Their language studies were broadcast on television once a week. Since 23 September 2012, they had also been fixed guests on the show @TV Akihabara (@TV秋葉原) which aired every Sunday and aimed to educate viewers on different forms of Japanese culture.\n\n\n==== First single, \"Koi no Tenki Yohō\" ====\nIn September 2012, the first single of the group, \"Koi no Tenki Yohō\", was announced. On 30 September 2012, the music video of the title track was officially released. The music video published on YouTube had attracted more than one million views.\nOn 17 October 2012, the single was physically released in two editions, regular and limited. The CDs in both editions contain the title track, and a B-side, \"Loving Pass – Koi no Password\", as well as the instrumental versions thereof. The limited edition was also accompanied by a special DVD containing the music video and a video of the girls introducing themselves.\n\n\n=== 2013: first Japanese album and debut in Taiwan ===\n\nIn 2013, Weather Girls saw additional developments in Japan. The group released three singles and one full-length album. The group also enjoyed opportunities to regularly appear on television, as it launched its first television show and first television drama. In addition, the girls decided to take a tough national examination to become licensed weather forecasters in Japan and took the whole year to prepare themselves for it. At the end of the year, the group also debuted in its homeland Taiwan and Wednesday Girl Dara had her own contract terminated, thereby leaving the group.\n\n\n==== Second and third singles, \"Koi wa Tokimeki Chūihō\" and \"Koi no Love – Sunshine\" ====\nOn 25 December 2012, the second single of the group, \"Koi wa Tokimeki Chūihō\", was announced.

The examination has been held biannually since 1994, reportedly with a five percent pass rate.\nFor the sake of the examination, the group took meteorological classes where a licensed weather forecaster gave lectures and fans were allowed to be present. These classes were called Absolutely Pass! (絶対合格！). On 25 January 2014, the group took the examination. On 9 May 2014, the last class took place at Pony Canyon Headquarters in Tokyo.\n\n\n==== First Japanese album, Weather Girls ====\nOn 17 May 2013, the first album of the group, called Weather Girls, was announced. On 3 July 2013, it was physically issued. The eponymous album contains six new songs and four hit songs from the previous singles. The songs vary from dance-pop to ballad.\nWith the theme of clouds, the concept art of the album was described as follows: \"Weather Girls, wearing fluffy marshmallow clouds, come to Japan riding on 'bomb anticyclone'\". The cloud outfits, the concept costumes for this album, were again designed by Junko Isogai from the fashion house Dexi.\nFrom its debut to the end of July 2013, the group had made a total of one hundred and one public performances. On 11 August 2013, the group performed at the A-Nation festival once again.\n\n\n==== Fourth single, \"Hey Boy – Weishenme?\", as well as first TV show and drama ====\nOn 19 August 2013, it was announced that the fourth single of the group, titled \"Hey Boy – Weishenme?\", would be released in autumn 2013.The release date was later announced to be 20 November 2013.\nThe title track served as the ending theme of Attack Shimasukedo Nani Ka?, a new television show hosted by the group.

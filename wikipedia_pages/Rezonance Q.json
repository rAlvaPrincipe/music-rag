The following year, a new version was released by Angel City featuring Lara McAllen which reached No. 7 in the charts. BCD Project also released a remix of Rainy Davis' \"Sweetheart\" which reached No. 163 in the charts in 2003. This was later re-recorded and released by Rezonance Q on All Around the World in 2004.\nThe group has also remixed several songs by other artists such as \"Rhythm Is a Dancer\" by Snap!, \"The Boys of Summer\" by DJ Sammy, \"Pretty Green Eyes\" by Ultrabeat, \"Sunrise\" by Angel City and \"All Together Now\" by The Farm.

    "text": "The Bucks were a band who played music based largely on Irish folk, touring briefly and recording and releasing one album for WEA Records in 1994.  While remaining obscure, the band was formed by well-known Irish musicians Ron Kavana and Terry Woods (of The Pogues, Sweeney's Men and Steeleye Span). Paddy Keenan played pipes.  James McNally (Storm, Pogues, Afro-Celt Sound System) was also a member, as were several members of Kavana's primary group, The Alias Band (Miriam Kavana, Fran Byrne).\nDespite positive reviews of both the album and the live shows, the band broke up after failing to attract enough attention.  Kavana lays the blame on WEA for not promoting the album or band.  He also maintains he “never got a penny” for the album.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Dancin' To The Ceili Band (album) ===\n\nReleased in 1994 Warner Music – WEA\n\nDancin' To The Ceili Band (R.

    "text": "Hissanol were a two-piece experimental indie rock band based in both Amsterdam, the Netherlands and Victoria, British Columbia, Canada active between 1994 and 1998.  The band was a studio-only project from former NoMeansNo guitarist Andy Kerr and Scott Henderson of Shovlhed, Swell Prod., the Showbusiness Giants, and other groups.\nSince its two members lived on separate continents, the band collaborated via air mail, building upon each other's songs on multi-track recording equipment.  Each member played a number of instruments and sang.  The group released two full-length albums on Alternative Tentacles.\nBoth musicians remain active; Kerr is currently playing in Two Pin Din.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n4th and Back CD/LP (1995, Alternative Tentacles)\nThe Making of Him CD/LP (1998, Alternative Tentacles)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHissanol at Alternative Tentacles\nAlternative Tentacles web page"

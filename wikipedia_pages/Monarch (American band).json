On April 2, 2015, they announced they will be releasing a new single entitled \"Snow White\". The video for the single was filmed on April 4.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nBand's music has been dubbed \"melodic-driven indie pop\", Monarch is often compared to bands like Elbow, Sigur Ros, Keane, and Denali. Monarch's songs are inspired by an independent approach to a melodic pop sound, including elements of urban grooves and hints of cinematic themes. Strawn adds, \"We usually start with a key line, mumble in a few melodies and let our imaginations get the best of us.\" Lead vocalist has also explained that the band is still in development of their sound, but their love for half time, heavy synth bass and big melodies will never change.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent Members\n\nBrennan Strawn – vocals (2002–present)\nBrent Kutzle – keyboards, bass guitar, cello (2010–present)\nBrian Willet – keyboards (2010–present)\nJoel Plotnik – drums (2010–present)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

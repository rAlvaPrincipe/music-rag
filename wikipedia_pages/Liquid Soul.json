    "text": "Liquid Soul is an American jazz, hip-hop, funk, freestyle fusion ensemble, formed in 1993 from Chicago, Illinois, which helped pioneer the acid jazz movement in the United States in the 1990s. Coined \"Beyond Acid Jazz\" by founder Mars Williams who played with The Psychedelic Furs and previously with The Waitresses and Billy Idol, the group was co-founded by guitarist Tommy Klein, from the Spies Who Surf, and Chicago DJ Jesse De La Peña. The band's 2000 album Here's the Deal was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Contemporary Jazz Album category.\n\n\n== History ==\nTheir first regular venue was at Chicago's Elbo Room, where their quickly-growing popularity led to the release of their self-titled, debut album Liquid Soul by Ark 21 Records. A well-popularized appearance at Dennis Rodman's birthday party added to their notoriety. They were the main feature at Double Door in Wicker Park for almost four years (Feb. 1996 to Dec. 1999). Subsequent tours took them across the United States and Canada, plus performances in Germany, Turkey and Japan. They have opened for Sting and Isaac Hayes, played at Bill Clinton's second Inaugural Parade and 21st Century Ball, and were the first acid jazz band to play at the Newport Jazz Festival. They also appeared twice at the South By Southwest Music Festival where the Austin American-Statesman referred to them as \"the single hottest showcase of the festival.\" They have recorded four more CDs: Make Some Noise (produced by Ark 21 Records in 1998), Grammy-nominated Here's the Deal (produced by Shanachie Records in 2000), Evolution (produced by Shanachie in 2002) and most recently One-Two Punch (produced by major label Telarc in 2006).\n\n\n== Notable performances and venues ==\nMetro Chicago Music for Mars Tribute, Chicago, Nov 25 2023\nDouble Door Liquid Soul 20th Anniversary Show, Chicago, Jan 20 2013\nNiwot Jazz on 2nd Avenue, Niwot, CO Aug 19 2012\nDouble Door Liquid Soul 15th Anniversary Show, Chicago, Jan 18 2009\nSting opening shows (Central Park, New York City; Blockbuster Pavilion, Charlotte, NC; Alltel Pavilion, Raleigh, NC), Sept. 2000\nChicago Jazz Festival, Sept. 2000\nJazz Wind 2000 Festival in Furano, Japan, Aug. 2000\nNewport Jazz Festival in Madarao, Japan, Aug. 2000\nSioux Falls Jazz and Blues Festival, July 2000\nRavinia Festival with Isaac Hayes, July 2000\nCancun Jazz Festival, Mexico (May 2000)\nMusic Midtown Festival, Atlanta, Ga.

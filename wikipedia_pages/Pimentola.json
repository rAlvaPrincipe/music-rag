    "text": "Pimentola (literally, \"Region of Darkness\") is an electronic orchestral/industrial project from Finland. Originally formed in 1996 by Lempo and Turja, it has since become the solo project of Lempo. Early dark/black metal influences have been dropped and experimental, industrial, neoclassical, orchestral, ethnic and tribal sounds have been added. In 2006 Pimentola was signed to the highly influential Swedish label Cold Meat Industry, which released the CD Misantropolis in 2007.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nTuoni Pauloo Tiukoin Sitein (CDr, 2004)\nTuoni Pauloo Tiukoin Sitein (CDr, Mini, 2004)\nMM-MMV (CD, 2005)\nPimentola (7\", 2005)\nPimentola / Dead Man's Hill (CDr, 2005)\nMM-MMV (Cass, 2006)\nMisantropolis (CD, 2007)\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n=== Official ===\nOfficial Pimentola website\nCold Meat Industry Website\n\n\n==== Misc ====\nPimentola at Discogs"

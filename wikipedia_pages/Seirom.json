    "text": "Seirom is a dark ambient musical project started by Dutch multi-instrumentalist and composer Maurice de Jong, otherwise known as Mories. It was founded in 2011 and marked a stark contrast to de Jong's previous work, embracing a more ethereal sound.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Seirom project was conceived in 2011 after composer Maurice de Jong had reached a creative exhaustive point with his other active projects. \"I started to feel burned out. I think all the negativity (in my music making) kind of had an impact on me. I needed to do something positive.\" He independently released Eremitic on June 6, 2011. 1973 was released on November 9, 2012 and featured a lighter more positive tone compared to Seirom's debut. On May 1, 2014 the third full-length album And the Light Swallowed Everything was released and received positively, with Kez Whelan of Terrorizer describing the music as \"hauntingly, harrowingly, luminously beautiful.\" Seirom's fourth album I Was So Sad was released on July 8, 2016.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nEremitic (2011)\n1973 (2012)\nAnd the Light Swallowed Everything (2014)\nI Was So Sad (2016)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSeirom on Facebook\nSeirom at Bandcamp\nSeirom discography at Discogs\nSeirom discography at MusicBrainz"

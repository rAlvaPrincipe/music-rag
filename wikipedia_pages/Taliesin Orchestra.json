    "text": "The Taliesin Orchestra (alternately known as Taliesin) is an American musical group, generally classified as new-age music. that specializes in remaking famous songs into orchestra-style melodies.\nThe band's first album, Orinoco Flow: The Music of Enya, was a collection of songs originally created and sung by Enya; it was released in 1996.  Since then the band has recorded several other albums, some of them being further Enya remakes, but also including albums of songs by George Winston and Jim Brickman. Originally on Anthem (1997) and again on Rock Rhapsody (2008) the band covered such famous songs such as Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick In The Wall\", Eric Clapton's \"Layla\" and the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\".\nThe Taliesin Orchestra is led by keyboardist Trammell Starks and features the voice, vocal arranging, vocal production, and in some cases songwriting of Felicia Farerre (aka Felicia Sorensen).  Charles Sayre acts as conductor, producer and arranger.\nOrinoco Flow topped the Billboard Top Indie Classical Albums list in May 1998. In the year-end-list of 1997, Orinoco Flow was ranked 8th in Billboards' list of Classical Crossover Albums, and the Taliesin Orchestra in joint 7th among Classical Crossover Artists.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Enya tributes ===\n1996 Orinoco Flow: The Music of Enya\n1998 Maiden of Mysteries: Music of Enya\n2002 Thread of Time: The Best of the Music of Enya\n2005 Sail Away: The Music of Enya\n2006 An Instrumental Tribute to the Hits of Enya\n2009 Tribute to the Hits of Enya\n\n\n=== Other ===\n1997 Forbidden Forest: Impressions of George Winston\n1997 Anthem\n2002 Sacred\n2004 Valentine: The Music of Jim Brickman\n2005 Top of the World: A Tribute to the Carpenters\n2008 Rock Rhapsody\n2008 \"Bella's Lullaby (Piano Version) For 'Twilight'\"\n\n\n== Notes =="

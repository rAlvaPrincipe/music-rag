The music is characterized by some as \"escapist\" in the usage of space, chords and ethnic overtones.  The chord structure has an absences of \"thirds\" and is similar to other African Diaspora and African classical music by its “drum and bass” dominance. Not all the music fits into the smooth jazz canon, as some of it is more in the film score world. Their first album was released in 1999.  The original members of the group were Owen 'Alik Shahadah (Piano/keyboards), Natasha Odlum-Shahadah (voice), David Hadley (Bass), Brian McCooke (drums).

    "text": "City High were an American R&B/hip hop trio consisting of Ryan Toby, Robbie Pardlo, and Claudette Ortiz. The group's sole studio album City High (2001), was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Their biggest hit, the Wyclef Jean-produced single \"What Would You Do?\", was an MTV staple, and earned them a nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. Their 2001 single \"Caramel\" featuring rapper Eve peaked within the top twenty on the US Billboard Hot 100. City High disbanded shortly after.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2001, City High released \"What Would You Do?\" from their self-titled album. Their follow-up single was \"Caramel\", with a remix featuring rapper Eve. The final single from the group's debut and only album was \"City High Anthem\".\nPrior to the creation of City High, bandmates Claudette Ortiz and Robbie Pardlo dated throughout their high school years. After meeting and performing for Wyclef Jean, they were signed to his Booga Basement recording label. As Wooga Booga already had a duo, they invited Ryan Toby and became the City High trio instead. Following her breakup with Pardlo, Ortiz went on to date Toby. Ortiz and Toby married in 2004, but later divorced in 2007.\nAbout the disbandment, Toby said: \"We did a second album, it wasn't as good as the first album, it was a little rushed. There was some turmoil in the group, the vibe and chemistry was off. We decided to walk away.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References =="

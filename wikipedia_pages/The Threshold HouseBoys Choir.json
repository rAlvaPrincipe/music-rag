    "text": "The Threshold HouseBoys Choir was a musical guise for Peter Christopherson, announced in 2005 as a follow-up endeavor to his former group Coil. Despite the name, it was a solo project which relied heavily on computer-generated vocals, of which he was formally credited as the \"director\". The name was derived from a play on words, combining the terms houseboy, house of boys, boys' choir and Threshold House. THBC was stationed in Bangkok, Thailand.\nOne of its last performances was held in 2008 at the historic Ambrosio Cinema in Turin, Italy. Christopherson (featuring David Tibet, Othon Mataragas and Ernesto Tomasini) performed a new live soundtrack to Derek Jarman's film The Angelic Conversation (the original score for the film was created in the 1980s by Coil).\nThe last performance of The Threshold HouseBoys Choir was on 14 June 2009, at Conway Hall, London as part of the Equinox Festival.\n\n\n== Releases ==\nForm Grows Rampant CD + DVD, released on 19 April 2007\nThe Threshold HouseBoys Choir Amulet Edition 4 x 3\" CD-R set, released on 22 November 2008\n\n\n== Contributions on compilations ==\n...It Just Is compilation CD released on 23 December 2005.

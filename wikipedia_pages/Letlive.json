In 2003, the band's debut EP Exhaustion, Salt Water, and Everything in Between was released on at One Records. After a line-up change (with only Butler and Sharp remaining), their first album Speak Like You Talk was released in 2005, also on at One Records. Bassist Ryan Jay Johnson joined the band before the release, but did not perform on the album. In 2007 Ben Sharp left the band and the band was plagued by subsequent line-up changes and a scrapped album.\n\n\n=== Fake History (2009–2013) ===\nAfter establishing a first stable lineup with guitarists Jean Nascimento and Ryan Johnson, and drummer Anthony Rivera accompanying Butler and Johnson, letlive. toured extensively throughout the US and Canada and gained momentum. The band signed with Tragic Hero Records in 2009 and released their second album titled Fake History the next year. The band continued touring and after signing with Epitaph Records in February 2011, undertook a brief European tour. They were signed to Epitaph after Bring Me the Horizon frontman Oliver Sykes contacted label owner Brett Gurewitz after watching them perform at a single gig in 2008.\nEpitaph re-released Fake History in April 2011 with three additional tracks, including two B-sides and one new song produced by Brett Gurewitz. The re-release has been the subject of several favorable reviews from AllMusic, Alternative Press, the BBC and Rock Sound. Starting in June 2011, the band undertook more extensive touring, including appearances at Download Festival and Leeds Festival, supporting Enter Shikari and Your Demise on their mainland European tour, and, in the United States, supporting Underoath and August Burns Red.

The Blackest Beautiful was released on July 9, 2013 to positive critical reception. The writing process surfaced many creative tensions amongst the band members, about which Butler stated, \"We set the bar high and everything needed to be approved by everybody else. Eventually we had to become very transparent with each other and just say 'look, I just don't like this' or 'this isn't working for me.'\". In an interview with Fuse, released on July 16, it was confirmed that Loniel Robinson, their touring drummer, as well as drum tech for Of Mice & Men, would become a permanent member. The album debuted in the United States at number 74 on the Billboard 200 and number six on Hard Rock Albums, selling nearly five thousand copies. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 62. A music video for the song \"Younger\" was released on September 26, 2013. On January 23, letlive. revealed that they would be releasing \"renditions\" of songs from The Blackest Beautiful, featuring various artists on remade versions of the songs. The first \"rendition\" released was a new version of \"27 Club\", featuring Keith Buckley of Every Time I Die. On April 23, their second \"rendition\" released was a new version of \"The Dope Beat\", featuring Dan \"Soupy\" Campbell of The Wonder Years.\n\nOn February 10, 2015, Jean Nascimento left the band for unknown reasons. In light of his departure, Kenji Chan, former live guitarist for Bruno Mars and former member of Ryan and Jeff's previous band, Best Interest, acted as the band's touring guitarist.\nOn September 25, 2015, the band posted a tweet confirming that they had completed their fourth album and that it would be released in 2016. On the same day, they also confirmed that further additions to their 'Renditions' project/album would be put on hold to focus on new music. On November 3, 2015, in a Revolver Magazine online article, letlive. disclosed that their fourth studio album would be entitled If I'm the Devil....\n\n\n=== Split (2017) ===\nOn April 28, 2017, the band announced that after 15 years together as a band, \"there will be no further activity for the foreseeable future\".\nIn June and July 2017, Butler, former The Chariot guitarist Stephen \"Stevis\" Harrison, and Night Verses drummer Aric Improta began teasing a new project called The Fever 333 (later shortened to Fever 333). The band performed their first show together out of the back of U-Haul truck in the parking lot of Randy's Donuts in Inglewood, California.\n\n\n=== Fake History 10th anniversary (2020) ===\nOn April 13, 2020, the band started using their Instagram account again and teased fans with a 10th anniversary release of Fake History complete with unreleased songs and demos.[1]\n\n\n=== The Blackest Beautiful 11th anniversary and farewell tour (2024-2025) ===\nOn April 17, 2024, the band posted an announcement of the remix and remaster of The Blackest Beautiful and announced they will be performing a farewell tour in 2025. \"To our friends that we never got to say goodbye to: we'll see you next year to do so,\" the statement read. \"We'd like suitable spaces around the world for proper farewells.\" In October 2024, the band announced the first show of their farewell tour as part of the 2025 When We Were Young line-up.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nletlive.'s musical style has been described as post-hardcore as well as experimental rock, art punk and metalcore. Remfry Dedman, writing for The Independent, described letlive.'s sound as \"harnessing the severe, frenetic power of Black Flag and marrying it to the melodic, infectious soul of Michael Jackson\" In a 2011 interview with Rock Sound, frontman Jason Butler stated that they \"want to show people American punk rock soul is very much well and alive\". Typical aspects of the band's music include Butler's emotive vocal delivery, duelling guitars and introspective lyrics that cover topics such as infidelity, culture, greed and corruption.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\nSpeak Like You Talk (2005)\nFake History (2010)\nThe Blackest Beautiful (2013)\nIf I'm the Devil...

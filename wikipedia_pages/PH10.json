Most notably, pH10 was honored as the First Place winner of Jive Magazine's International Songwriting Competition 2005  for the track \"Tell Me Why\" - a collaboration with hip hop vocalist Pete Miser. pH10's latest recording, \"Well Connected\" has been called in a Jive Magazine review \" the nastiest, noisiest, scariest, loudest and by far the heaviest...\"\n\n\n== Biography ==\npH10 was started by founding members Recone F. Helmut and Clark ov Saturn after they split from industrial rock band, LD-50. Their debut release, \"Recone Helmut vs. Clark ov Saturn\" was one of the Denver Westword's \"20 best recordings to come out of Denver in 1998\".\nShortly thereafter, Helmut and Saturn signed with Mutant Sound System/ Trumystic Records, toured with Dr. Israel and the Trumystic Sound System throughout Europe, and then relocated to Brooklyn, NY. Saturn eventually split and started working in minimal techno group Socks and Sandals with Nicolas Sauser. Helmut continued to produce albums with vocalist Pete Miser and his new partner, SyBO. pH10 returned to Colorado in 2005.\n\n\n== Current members ==\nRecone F.

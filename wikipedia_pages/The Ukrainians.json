    "text": "The Ukrainians are a British band, which plays traditional Ukrainian music, heavily influenced by western post-punk.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe Ukrainians were formed in 1990 by Wedding Present guitarist Peter Solowka, with singer/violinist Len Liggins and mandolin player Roman Remeynes, after all three had played on the Wedding Present's Ukrainian John Peel Sessions recordings (Ukrainski Vistupi v Johna Peela, released 1989).  Following the success of that release, the trio began composing and recording in Ukrainian as a separate band.\nIn 1991, their first EP, Oi Divchino, was awarded Single of the Week by British music weekly, NME.   Notably, the video for this release was filmed in pre-revolution Kyiv making them the first western band to produce a video entirely in Eastern Europe.\nIn the same year, Solowka left the Wedding Present, later claiming that he had been kicked out, the success of the Ukrainian project making him the scapegoat for the band's lack of mainstream success.\nSince 1991, the band has released seven studio albums as well as various live albums and EPs, all without chart success in the UK. They continue to tour regularly, especially in Poland and England.  They celebrated 20 years of the band in 2011 with a tour of British Ukrainian clubs.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nBesides Solowka, Liggins and Remeynes, band members have included:\n\nDave Lee - drums\nWoody - drums, percussion\nChris Harrop - bass guitar\nPaul 'Dino' Briggs - bass guitar\nAllan Martin - bass guitar\nAlan Dawson- Bass guitar\nJames Howe - bass guitar\nStepan \"Ludwig\" Pasicznyk - accordion, backing vocals, guitar\nSteve Tymruk - accordion, melodion, backing vocals\nPaul Weatherhead - electric mandolin, sopilka, theremin\nMichael L.B.

    "text": "The Fire of the Carolinas, the marching band at Elon University, is a contemporary ensemble that performs at all Phoenix home football games, select away football games, and at various University events throughout the fall. All Elon students are eligible for membership within the band which includes winds, percussion, color guard, feature twirler, and dance team. FOTC members are from almost every area of study on campus, with over 30 different majors represented each year.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first reference to Elon College's (now Elon University) band marching onto the field to perform halftime shows is in Elon's 1938 yearbook. It was organized by student Landon Walker and had 22 members under Drum Major Harold Hilburn. The marching band lasted until 1982 and shut down due to disinterest. Bill DeJournett, band director at Colorado State University, was hired to resurrect Elon's band.  The current director of the band is Dr. Jonathan Poquette, who also serves as the school's wind ensemble director.\n\n\n=== Directors ===\nLandon Davis Walker (1938)\nCharles R.

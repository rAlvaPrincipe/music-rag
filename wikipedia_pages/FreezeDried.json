    "text": "FreezeDried was a polka band from Chicago that performed Polish push-style polkas. They mixed polkas with other music styles such as Latin music, zydeco, gospel music, dixieland music and rock music. Their efforts have inspired other traditional polka bands to be more creative in their approach to new material, musical arrangements and showmanship.\nIn 2006, FreezeDried added a female vocal trio known as \"The Icicles\", singing in a motown and soul style.\nFreezeDried members are Ted Okrzesik Jr., John Krawisz, John Okrzesik Sr., Dan Okrzesik Sr., A.J. Okrzesik, and Andrew Okrzesik. The record label of FreezeDried is Chrome Pierogi Recording and is an Indie label. Since 1998, they have performed at venues such as the Taste of Chicago, Minnesota State Fair, WGN radio and  numerous town summer fests.\nThe band broke up in 2020.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBodacious Ditties     2019\nDegenerationGap     2009\nFear of Rubber Cushions     2006\nDeliberate Confusion     2003\nArtistically Challenged;     2000\n\n\n== References =="

The current roster includes Scott Starns (vocals, guitar), Jason Deal (guitar), Annatomik (bass) and Mike Mosteller (drums, samples).\n\n\n== Band history ==\nThe core of Thirteen Stars was formed in 1998 when singer Scott Starns and former guitarist Anthony DeWolfe met bassist Annatomik and drummer John London through an ad in a local Oklahoma City newspaper. The band immediately started doing local gigs and gathered a solid fanbase.\nIn 1999, after only a few months together, the band self-financed their first album titled The Nova Project, which was produced by Trent Bell. Soon after the band had graduated to bigger gigs and tours in the southwest and midwest region, opening for acts such as The All-American Rejects, Blue October and Maroon 5.\nIn 2002 the band released a collection of demos titled Songs from the Musicbox and continued regionally touring. In 2005 the band released These Places, their first national release.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent Members\n\nScott Starns\nJason Deal\nAnnatomik\nMike Mosteller\nPast Members\n\nJohn London\nAnthony DeWolfe\nSean Miller\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Nova Project (1999)\nSongs from the Musicbox (2002)\nThese Places (2005)\n\n\n== External links ==\nThirteen Stars Official Site\nThirteen Stars on Myspace\nReview of \"These Places\""

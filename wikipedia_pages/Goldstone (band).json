Aimie and Helen met whilst with the Dirty Dancing theatre show and formed the group through their love of pop music.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2018: Eurovision: You Decide ===\nGoldstone were 2018 contestants in Eurovision: You Decide, in a bid to represent the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. This was the result of three months of auditions at the BBC's London headquarters, which whittled the contestants down to six finalists.\nThey performed their pop song, \"I Feel The Love\" by Eric Lumiere, Joakim Buddee, Laura White and Roel Rats but in the end they lost to SuRie. Despite this, the band members were upbeat and positive about the experience performing at the event.\n\n\n=== 2018: Voice of Astana winners ===\nGoldstone were 2018 winners of The Voice of Astana, held in Kazakhstan.\n\n\n== Other endeavours ==\nIn 2017, Atkinson played Katherine Howard in the Original West End cast of SIX the musical in 2019 and would go on to form a seven piece girl group called SVN in 2021 with six other members of this cast: Millie O'Connell, Natalie May Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Jarn√©ia Richard-Noel, Maiya Quansah-Breed, and their original dance captain, Grace Mouat.

    "text": "port-royal (intentionally written without capitalization and with the \"-\" between \"port\" and \"royal\") is a Genoa, Italy-based electronica and post-rock band formed in the year 2000 by Attilio Bruzzone (Guitar, Keyboards) and Ettore Di Roberto (Piano, Keyboards). Soon after they were joined by Ettore's brother Michele Di Roberto (Drums), Emilio Pozzolini (Keyboards, Sampling), and Giulio Corona (Bass). The band's music emphasizes instrumentals over lyrics; a style resembling other instrumentally focused bands, such as Mogwai and M83.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn July 2000, childhood friends Attilio (who is also a philosopher, Ph.D, and co-founder of the band Diamat, which released 2 albums via n5MD) and Ettore from Genoa, Italy, decided to form a band during a party. Their first practice session is Ettore's bedroom which had a piano and an acoustic guitar with a TASCAM 4 Track cassette recorder. In September, Ettore's younger brother and fellow drum player Michele joins the band and finds a name for the project. More sessions (guitar-synth/piano-drums) take place in the so-called \"Saletta\", nothing but a basement in the old Genovese city-center. Songs are written and some will be the melodic basis of future tracks, others will be forgotten. In February 2001, the band's line up is completed with the arrival of Emilio Pozzolini, a friend and schoolmate. All 4 port-royal members come from the very same high school, «Liceo Classico Statale \"C. Colombo\"». Throughout the years, the band would experience a shift in band members (never affecting the main members though), but the music would always preserve the same rigorous attitude and unique style, granted by experimenting a lot and mixing together various genres without never being swallowed up in one single direction/genre.\nIn the last 10 years, port-royal experienced an extensive live activity together with the production of all their major works: they have been playing in all Europe, former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia and the United States.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nAttilio Bruzzone (Guitar, Keyboards, Programming, Bass and sometimes Vocals) 2000–Present\nEttore Di Roberto (Piano, Keyboards, Programming and sometimes Vocals) 2000–Present\nEmilio Pozzolini (Samplers, Programming) 2001–Present\n\n\n=== Past members ===\nMichele Di Roberto (Drums) 2000-2005\nGiulio Corona (Programming) 2003-2008\nSieva Diamantakos (Visuals, Videos) 2007–2014\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== LPs ===\nFlares (Resonant Recordings 2005)\nAfraid To Dance (Resonant Recordings 2007)\nFlared Up - Remixes (Resonant Recordings 2008)\nMagnitogorsk - split LP with Absent Without Leave, 4 tracks each artist (Sound In Silence 2008)\nDying In Time (n5MD, debruit&desilence, Sleeping Star, Isound Labels, Klik Records 2009)\n2000-2010: The Golden Age Of Consumerism (n5MD 2011)\nWhere Are You Now (n5MD 2015)\nYou Ware Nowhere - Remixes (n5MD 2016)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nKraken EP (Marsiglia Records 2002)\nHonved EP (Chat Blanc Records 2007)\nAnya: Sehnsucht EP (Chat Blanc Records 2008)\nBalding Generation (Losing Hair as We Lose Hope) (n5MD 2009)\nAfterglow EP w/ Millimetrik (Sang D'Encre Factory 2010)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nBias Illumination Over Diffracted Hearts (2003)\nMilk In My Cup (Green Fog 2004)\nLosing Today (Not On Label 2005)\nThe Wire Tapper (Not On Label 2005)\nFirst Past and the Post (Not On Label 2005)\nZenatron (De Vega De Ferrari 2006)\nThese Waves (Sound In Silence Records 2006)\nLet's Talk About Muerte Pop (Muerte Pop 2007)\nI Am You Are Me - Millimetrik Remixes & Unreleased (Chat Blanc Records 2007)\nChat Blanc 3rd Anniversary Compilation (Chat Blanc Records 2007)\nFestival Elektroni[k] Septième Édition (Not On Label 2007)\nLittle Darla Has A Treat For You Vol. 25 - Endless Summer 2007-08 (Darla 2007)\nLost Days, Open Skies And Streaming Tides - Manual Rarities & Remixes (Darla 2007)\nTreatment Effects (Chew-Z 2007)\nMerry6mas 2007 (Make Mine Music 2007)\nWe Believe Vol. 2 (9.12 Records 2007)\nPostRockNotes.com Compilation (Not On Label 2008)\nAlternative Trippin Vol. 2 (Chaos Management - Emi Poland 2008)\nNorthwest Passage's New Era - Millimetrik Album (Make Mine Music 2008)\nTympanik Audio's Emerging Organisms vol. 4 (Tympanik Audio 2011)\nDark Side of Pop (Cowshed Records 2012)\nAMBIELOGUE - Chapter I (Pinmusik 2013)\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\nFelix da Housecat - (\"We All Wanna Be Prince\") (2009)\nLadytron - (\"Tomorrow\") (2010) and (Velocifero (Remixed and Rare)\") (2010)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nBand Facebook\nBand YouTube channel\nBand Last.fm\nBand MySpace\nOndarock biography and reviews (italian only)\n\"Dark Side of Pop\" compilation"

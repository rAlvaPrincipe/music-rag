They were active in the 1980s in Dallas, Texas & NYC.\nBoth groups recorded an upbeat dance music cover of The Temptations' \"(I Know) I'm Losing You\" in 1983 which contained the original version of the song and an instrumental version by Uptown. Not The Uptown Girls.   The track achieved popularity at Dallas' famed Starck nightclub due to play by DJ Rick Squillante and became a standard in many U.S. nightclubs, reaching the No. 80 spot on Billboard's Hot 100 in 1987.  In 1989, it was re-recorded by The Uptown Girls with side A containing the Ultimix version and 89 Remix and Side B contained the Bonus Beats and Serious Sirens Mix.\nIn 1987, recording under the name of Uptown Girls feat.

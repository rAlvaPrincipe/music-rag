    "text": "Atwater-Donnelly is an American folk music group from Rhode Island consisting of Aubrey Atwater, Elwood Donnelly, and occasionally other musicians and dancers. They have toured throughout the United States and internationally, playing guitar, banjo, Appalachian dulcimer, tin whistle, limberjack, and other instruments. In recent years, they have also performed as The Atwater-Donnelly Trio, with Cathy Clasper-Torch.\nAtwater and Donnelly met as volunteers at the Stone Soup Coffeehouse in Rhode Island in early 1987, and started playing together a few months later. They specialize in traditional American folk music and Celtic folk music, but write and play their own songs as well. Their performances have been featured on All Songs Considered and Fiona Ritchie's The Thistle & Shamrock on public radio. Atwater regularly runs workshops at places like the John C. Campbell Folk School, as well as performing and teaching  clogging and flat-footing dance, derived mainly from dance steps learned in Appalachia and the southeast U.S.\n\nThey were one of the earlier musical groups to be on the web, after one of their fans worked with Atwater to put a site up in 1995.\nThey have released 14 albums, several books of poetry, and three songbooks.\nAtwater was selected to serve as Artist-in-residence at the Grand Canyon National Park in Mayâ€“June 2011.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Atwater-Donnelly ===\nLabor and Love (1988)\nCulled from the Garden (1991)\nLike the Willow Tree (1994)\nWhere the Wild Birds Do Whistle (1997)\nAnd Then I'm Going Home: Atwater-Donnelly Live (2001)\nThe Blackest Crow (2004)\nWhen Winter Calls (2005)\nThe Halfway Ground (2007) (with Cathy Clasper-Torch, Heidi Cerrigione, John Cerrigione, Uriah Donnelly, and Kevin Doyle)\nThe Weaver's Bonny (2009) (with Cathy Clasper-Torch, John and Heidi Cerrigione, Uriah Donnelly, and Kevin Doyle)\nEach Other's Story (2011) (with Cathy Clasper-Torch, John and Heidi Cerrigione, Kevin Doyle, Paul Dube, Morgan Santos, and Alex Krepkikh)\nThe World Is Old Tonight (2016) (with Cathy Clasper-Torch, John Cerrigione, Uriah Donnelly, Kevin Doyle, and Torrin Ryan)\nThe Boat You Row (2022) (with Cathy Clasper-Torch, Erin Lobb Mason, and Torrin Ryan)\n\n\n=== Atwater solo ===\nSimple Sentences (1992)\nDaily Growing: Aubrey Atwater Live in the Classroom (1999)\n\n\n=== DVD ===\nGoing Up Home: The Passion of Atwater-Donnelly (2007)\nThis documentary was written and directed by Aubrey and Elwood's youngest son, Uriah.

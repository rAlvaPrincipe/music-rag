    "text": "Lettuce is a funk band originating from Boston, Massachusetts in 1992. Its members include guitarist Adam \"Shmeeans\" Smirnoff, Nigel Hall (keyboards, Hammond B-3 organ, piano, vocals), Adam Deitch (drums/percussion), Erick \"Jesus\" Coomes (bass), Ryan Zoidis (saxophone) and Eric \"Benny\" Bloom (trumpet).\n\n\n== History ==\nLettuce began in the summer of 1992, when all of its members attended a music program at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts as teenagers. Brought together by the influence of various funk bands including Herbie Hancock, Earth, Wind and Fire, and Tower of Power, the band jammed throughout that summer before going their separate ways.\nIn the fall of 1994, the band reconvened as undergrads at Berklee and attempted to play at various Boston jazz clubs, walking in and asking the club owners and other musicians if they would \"let us play\", giving birth to the name Lettuce. Michael Butler played keyboards with the band early on and then Jeff Bhasker took on the role. When he left, Neal Evans joined.\nMainly from word of mouth, Lettuce developed strong followings in New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, and Tokyo. They released their first CD, Outta Here, in 2002, followed by their Live in Tokyo album recorded at the Blue Note in 2003.\nIn 2008, Lettuce released their second album, entitled Rage!. Drawing heavily from many of the leaders of the 1970s funk movement, Rage! features covers of Curtis Mayfield's \"Move on Up\" and Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band's \"Express Yourself\".\nIn 2011, Lettuce played on the Royal Family Ball tour with their brother band, Soulive, and was accompanied at select shows by Rashawn Ross of the Dave Matthews Band. During this tour, they began playing new songs that would be featured on the band's next album, Fly!, in 2012.\nMany of Lettuce's members have had success in other areas of the music industry. Krasno and Evans are members of the jazz/organ trio Soulive. Zoidis is a former and founding member of the Rustic Overtones. Coomes is a session bass player and has toured with Britney Spears and The Game. Deitch is a producer who also plays with Break Science, and he has worked with John Scofield and Wyclef Jean. Smirnoff has toured with Lady Gaga and Robert Randolph & the Family Band. In addition to playing with Lettuce, Ross has been a full-time member of the Dave Matthews Band since 2010.\nLettuce played with the Soul Rebels Brass Band on Jam Cruise 2013. The band's album Crush was released in November 2015 and reached number one on the U.S. Jazz Albums chart.\nIn 2020, Lettuce's album Elevate was nominated for a Grammy for Instrumental Album of the Year.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nErick \"E.D.\" Coomes – bass guitar (1992–present)\nAdam Deitch – drums, percussion (1992–present)\nAdam \"Shmeeans\" Smirnoff – guitar (1992–present)\nRyan Zoidis – alto sax, baritone saxophone, tenor saxophone (1992–present)\nNigel Hall – vocals, Hammond B-3 organ, Clavinet, piano (2006–present)\nEric \"Benny\" Bloom – trumpet (2011–present)\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nSam Kininger – alto saxophone, tenor saxophone (1992–2010)\nEric Krasno – guitar (1992–2015)\nJeff Bhasker – keyboards, organ (1994–2002)\nNeal Evans – Hammond B-3 organ, Clavinet, piano (2002–2017)\nRashawn Ross – trumpet (2003–2011)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nInternet Archive's Lettuce live music collection"

    "text": "The King's Own Calgary Regiment Band is the regimental band of The King's Own Calgary Regiment based at Mewata Armouries in Calgary, Alberta. It is currently one of two Primary Reserve bands in 41 Canadian Brigade Group and is the de facto military bands for the southern Alberta area. The regimental band is an composed of volunteer members, all of whom have completed the Basic Military Qualification (BMQ) and many of whom have studied and trained at the Canadian Forces School of Music at CFB Borden.\nThe band has the following ensembles:\n\nWind Ensemble\nBrass Ensemble\nFanfare Team\nPercussion Ensemble\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was established in 1910, it served as the official band of the 103rd Regiment (Calgary Rifles), which was part of the Non-Permanent Active Militia. It originally consisted of members of the Calgary Fire Department and the Calgary Citizens Band. Following the outbreak of the First World War, many musicians of the band volunteered for service with 50th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, where they continued to serves as musicians, as well as medical personnel, stretcher bearers and stick orderlies. Unlike its service in the first war, the band did not deploy with the KOCR to Europe during the Second World War. The band gained new members in 1963 with the official disbandment of the Band of the Calgary unit of the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps that year. In 1966, the band, then under the direction of Victor Wright, was dissolved by order of the Department of National Defense. It was reinstated in the early 1970s.\nA decade later, the band stirred controversy when it performed its regimental march, Colonel Bogey March, during the visit of the Prime Minister of Japan Masayoshi ÅŒhira to Ottawa in May 1980, which was perceived as an insult as it was used in the movie The Bridge on the River Kwai, which depicted prisoners of war held under inhumane conditions by the Japanese. In June 1991, the band took part in the funeral of the John Michael Pierce, a British oil developer who died at a ranch in Turner Valley. In 1992, the band released its first and as of 2020, only album titled: A Salute To Canada's War Veterans On Canada's 125th Anniversary 1992. In May 2005, the band performed martial music at the Scotiabank Saddledome for Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to Calgary.\n\n\n== Modern day activities ==\nThe KOCR Band participates several activities:\n\nMilitary parade\nRegimental Dinners\nConcerts\nRegimental Holidays\nPresentation of Colours\nFunerals (state and regimental)\nThe 35-member band primarily performs as a concert and parade band and performs at military and provincial functions in the community.

    "text": "Fabrika (Russian: Фабрика; Factory in English) is a Russian-Ukrainian pop girl group, originally from Moscow. Initially a four-piece, Fabrika was created from four female participants from the first season of the Russian musical reality show Fabrika Zvyozd in 2002, and included Irina Toneva, Sati Kazanova, Alexandra Savelyeva and Maria Alalykina. The line-up has had several profound changes since then. Long time a fully Russian group, Fabrika later acquired two Ukrainian-born members, Oleksandra Popova (2014-2021) and Mariya Honcharuk (2019-2022). As of 2019, Toneva was the only original member of the line-up.\nThroughout its two decades of activity, the group released two albums; Devushki fabrichnye (2003) and My takie raznye (2008). Among their most successful singles are \"Pro lyubov\", \"Devushki fabrichnye\", \"Ne vinovataya ya\", \"Ne rodis' krasivoy\" and \"Sekret\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2002-2003: Formation, Devushki fabrichnye and Alalykina's departure ===\nIn 2002, Irina Toneva, Sati Kazanova, Alexandra Savelyeva and Maria Alalykina all auditioned as soloists for the first season of the Russian music reality show Fabrika Zvyozd. All four were chosen to be among the last sixteen contestants of the first season, starting on 13 October 2002.\nToneva, Kazanova, Savelyeva and Alalykina all managed to reach the 8th reporting concert, where they were put into different groups. There, Toneva was paired as a duet with Pavel Artemiev, while Alalykina was paired as a duet with Alexey Kabanov. Savelyeva and Kazanova were put in a four-piece. The four-piece with Savelyeva and Kazanova sang \"Pro lyubov\" during the reporting concert, which eventually became Fabrika's first single. Unhappy with his choices, the musical producer of the first season of Fabrika Zvyozd, Igor Matvienko, rearranged the groups, creating a girl group with Toneva, Kazanova, Savelyeva and Alalykina instead. Named Fabrika, the four-piece performed two songs during the final and eventually placed second behind Korni.\nIn May 2003, Alalykina left Fabrika to focus on her studies and private life, where she later converted to Islam and moved to Dagestan. In 2020, during a television reunion at Segodnya vecherom, Toneva, Savelyeva and Kazanova said that they had no contact with Alalykina and had not seen her in over a decade. Matvienko added that Alalykina was a \"person that was not ready for the show business\".\nAfter Alalykina's departure, Fabrika became a trio, as Matvienko decided against finding a replacement. Instead, the recording of Fabrika's first album continued without Alalykina. In November 2003, the group released their debut album Devushki fabrichnye, which has been noted as one of the best Russian albums released in the 2000s. Subsequently, the group released their eponymous single \"Devushki fabrichnye\", which became one of their biggest hits to date.\n\n\n=== 2004-2010: \"Ne vinovataya ya\", My takie raznye and Kazanova's departure ===\nContinuing their large commercial output, Fabrika released three commercial singles in 2004. Next to that, the group continued touring throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States. Their 2004 single \"Lyolik\" won a Golden Gramophone Award. Their May 2004 single \"Rybka\" reached no. 7 at the Russian TopHit radio charts. In 2005, the group released their single \"Ne vinovataya ya\", for which they also recorded the music video together with Bondarchuk. The song and music video acquired a large commercial success in Russia, remaining their third-most aired single on Russian radio.\nThe group slightly reduced their output in 2007, but eventually recorded their second album My takie raznye, which was released in 2008. On 13 January 2008, Fabrika performed at the Russian Winter Festival in London, England.\nIn May 2010, Kazanova announced her departure from the group, stating that she wanted to embark on a solo career. Matvienko invited Katya Lee to take Kazanova's spot.\n\n\n=== 2011-2019: \"Ne rodis' krasivoy\", short hiatus and comeback ===\n\nThe commercial output of the group decreased during this period, but with \"Ne rodis' krasivoy\", the group achieved a top 40 radio hit. The music video for the song attracted over 100 million views, becoming one of the most-watched Russian music videos in 2013 on YouTube. During the recording of the music video in July 2013, Lee injured her spine, leading the group to go on a hiatus for the rest of the year. Savelyeva started her solo career the same year.\nIn February 2014, Lee announced her departure from the group. She was replaced by Ukrainian-born Oleksandra Popova, who previously auditioned for Nu Virgos, but had been eliminated during the second round of the final. Popova's debut was on the single \"Sekret\", which followed the same airplay success as \"Ne rodis krasivoy\".\nBetween 2015 and 2017, Fabrika's output again decreased. In 2016 and 2017, the group released one single each year, albeit both singles – \"A ya za toboy\" and \"Babochki\", which entered the top 50 of the TopHit airplay charts.\nIn 2018, their follow-up single \"Vova\" was less successful. In May 2018, the group re-released two of their most successful older singles; \"Pro lyubov\" and \"Devushki fabrichnye\", alongside a new single \"5 minut\". This was subsequently followed by \"Mogla kak mogla\" in June 2018.\nIn February 2019, Savelyeva announced her departure from the group, citing pregnancy as the main reason. For some time, an employee of Matvienko's production company, Antonina Klimenko, took her spot until a proper replacement was found. In October 2019, Ukrainian singer Mariya Honcharuk was announced as Savelyeva's replacement, leaving Toneva to be the only original member of Fabrika.\n\n\n=== 2020-present: Line-up changes ===\nIn July 2020, Fabrika and its former members Sati Kazanova and Alexandra Savelyeva took part in a special broadcast about Fabrika Zvyozd during Segodnya vecherom. When Toneva was asked by Maxim Galkin about the age discrepancy between her and the other two members, she answered; \"I don't remember\". When further pressed for an answer, Matvienko replied: \"2.5 years\". This led to criticism of Galkin on social media for pressing ahead with the question.\nIn March 2021, Popova left the group to start a solo career. She was replaced by Russian singer Valeriya Devyatova, a former member of Soprano Turetskogo. In February 2022. it was announced that Maria Goncharuk had left the group due to a disagreement with the management on the development of the group. In March 2022. the group performed for the first time with new member Ekaterina Moskaleva. In April and May 2022, Fabrika participated in a series of concerts organised in Russia, in support of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nIrina Toneva (born 27 June 1977, in Golitsyno-2, Russian SSR) is one of the original members of Fabrika.

    "text": "The Triangles are an indie pop band from Melbourne, Australia.\nEleanor Horsburgh, Julie Conway, Katherine Simpson (née James), Matt Gormann and Robert Simpson met as school friends in Boronia, a suburb of Melbourne.  They began playing together in 2003 and collaborated on writing songs that mixed elements of rock, psych-pop and folk.  They performed in local venues and self-released two song collections before signing with local label Half a Cow Records.  Through Half a Cow they released the CDs Magic Johnson (2005) and  Seventy-Five Year Plan (2007).  Magic Johnson spawned the regional hit singles \"Applejack\" and \"Let’s Replace the Cityscapes.\"\nThe Triangles ostensibly split after the release of their second CD when several members left Australia.  The band reformed early in 2010 when they were approached to perform \"Applejack\" in a Spanish TV commercial for Estrella Damm.  Consequently, the tune became a hit single in Spain during the summer of 2010, reaching No. 1 on the Spanish iTunes singles chart, as well as spending 14 weeks on the CD singles chart, peaking at No. 8.  The commercial has been viewed on YouTube over eight million times as of 2024, and led to the posting of numerous home-grown \"Applejack\" music videos by Spanish fans.  An album of previously released Triangles songs was released in July 2010 by Universal Music Spain. \"Applejack\" is also featured in Jetstar Airways advertising, and in 2013 for the LG G2 smartphone ad in Europe and the U.S.\nThe Triangles reactivated in late 2010 with new music in the form of an EP entitled The Night Lunch, released independently in 2011.\nOn 19 November 2013, World of Rock Records announced the release of \"Applejack\" as a limited edition, yellow seven-inch vinyl single, with \"Let's Replace The Cityscapes\" serving as the B-side. It was scheduled to be released in 2014. A commercial for the single was released by World of Rock Records on 19 December 2013.\nAs of 2017, Katherine and Robert Simpson perform and record as the duo Blooming Heck.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJulie Conway - keyboards, accordion\nMatt Gormann - guitars, vocals, ukulele, banjo, harmonica\nEleanor Horsburgh - vocals, drums, percussion, melodica, glockenspiel\nKatherine Simpson - bass guitar, vocals, recorder, ukulele, kazoo\nRobert Simpson – drums, guitars, synthesizer\n\n\n== Other appearances ==\nThe Triangles appear as guest artistes on When I Cross the River, the 2007 CD by Melbourne folk performer Tom Bolton.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nWaterfive (2003) independent\nRed Panda (2004) independent\nMagic Johnson (2005; reissued 2010) Half a Cow Records HAC117\nSeventy-Five Year Plan (2007) Half a Cow Records HAC125\nThe Triangles (2010) Universal Music Spain\nA Tray of Cards: Best Of And Unreleased Favourites (2017) Half a Cow Records HAC187D (digital only)\nBlooming Heck (Katherine Simpson and Robert Simpson; 2017) Half a Cow Records HAC190\n\n\n=== Singles/EPs ===\n\"Let’s Replace the Cityscapes\" (2003)\nThe Feast of Stephen (2003)\nChristmas 2005 (2005) Half a Cow Records YULEDO001\n\"I've Had Eyes for You\" (2006)\n\"Applejack\" (2010)\nThe Night Lunch EP (2011)\n\"Applejack\" b/w \"Let's Replace the Cityscapes\" (2014) World of Rock Records\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Triangles on SoundCloud\nOriginal website (archived)\nHistory of The Triangles\nThe Triangles on Myspace (archived)\nEstrella Damm 2010 video clip featuring The Triangles’ \"Applejack\"\nJetstar 2010 advert featuring The Triangles’ \"Applejack\"\nKatherine Simpson on MySpace\n\"VP\" promo clip from The Night Lunch EP\nLive performance of \"Applejack,\" Melbourne, 2007\nBlooming Heck on Facebook"

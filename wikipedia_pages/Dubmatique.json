Groupmates Dj Choice, OTMC, and Jérôme-Philippe are the first French-language hip-hop group from Canada to have a number one hit single on the francophone pop charts.

In the early 1990s Disoul moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He joined a hip-hop radio show named Dubmatique, with co-host Cedric it was eventually decided that it would become a group.

In 1994, they made their first appearance by doing a freestyle on the mix-tape Tape 9-Too Leust by Cut Killer.\nBy 1995, the group were doing shows in local clubs. They participated at the launch of the album Simple et Funky by Alliance Ethnik and the soundtrack for the movie La Haine. They won the award Best Hip Hop Group of the Year at the Gala Mimi. That same summer, they performed at the music festival Les FrancoFolies de Montréal.\nIn 1997, on the French Canadian market, they released their first album named La force de comprendre. It was soon certified platinum, selling over 125,000 copies. Because of the singles and music videos for Soul Pleureur, La force de comprendre, and Plus rien n’est pareil, they reached the top of the charts on commercial radio stations and TV channels for music videos. The reviews were favourable on both lyrics and the production. The album featured French rappers Menelik and 2 Bal.\nDubmatique went on to perform 150 shows on stages throughout Quebec. At the French Canadian equivalent of the \"Grammy Awards\" called \"Le Gala de L'ADISQ\", the band won the Félix Award of \"Best Rock Alternative Album\" (Their first year at \"Le Gala de L'ADISQ\", there was no Hip Hop section). They were nominated for Group of the year, and Revelation of the year.\nIn 1998 the band won the Félix Award for Group of the year, and two more nominations for Show of the year and Best Seller.

They launched the singles and music videos of La vie est si fragile with the violinist Ashley MacIsaac and Mémoires. The album was certified gold and sold 35,000 copies in the first week. They collaborated with two members of the group IAM: Shurik’n was featured on the song L’avenir, and Akhenathon remixed the single La force de comprendre from the first album. Montreal artists were also featured: El Winner of Latitude Nord, D-Shade of Shades of Culture and Mr. Len.

Shortly after, Disoul and OTMC launched solo projects. In 2005, Disoul decided to use his real name, Jérôme-Philippe and released a self-titled album where he mixed rapping and singing. OTMC followed up in 2006 with a Hip Hop album named Sincérité volontaire. Their respective songs would play on the radios throughout Quebec and sales were respectable.\nIn 2008, a group was created by a fan on Facebook to urge Dubmatique to reunite, and over 50,000 fans joined.

    "text": "Yeht Mae was an electro-industrial band from California which began in 1988 by vocalist and keyboard programmer Jeremy Daw. Daw was later joined by vocalist Lynda Sterling and released two self-distributed cassette demos. Their first CD 1000 Veins was released by the British gothic/industrial label Gymnastic Records whose albums were pressed in Germany.\nIn 1992, Daw wanted to find a new label and sent a demo tape to Zoth Ommog Records label head Talla 2XLC of the band Bigod 20. Unbeknownst to Daw, his track \"Proximity Effect\" had already found its way onto the Zoth Ommog compilation Body Rapture II, which helped in achieving a contract with the label. The band went on to release two albums on the label, Anatomy in 1992 and Transmitter in 1994.\nThe band's primary lyrical themes cover strange subjects such as death, experimental surgery, and alien abductions.\nDaw later formed T.H.C. (originally named \"The Hard Corps\") with George Sarah of Stereotaxic Device.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nAgainst Nature – cassette demo (1988)\nEndless Enemies – cassette demo (1990)\n1000 Veins – CD (1991) Gymnastic Records\nAnatomy – CD (1992) Zoth Ommog\nTransmitter – CD (1994) Zoth Ommog\neaM theY – CD (1996) Out of Line Music • CD (1997) Metropolis Records\n\n\n=== Compilation appearances ===\nSacred War – CD track #3 \"Keep the Devil Down\" (1990) Gymnastic Records\nHurt-A Psychotechnics Compilation – LP Side B track #5 \"Remission\" – (1991) Braindrops Records\nTorture Tech Overdrive – LP Side B track #5 \"Freedom\" (1991) If It Moves...\nBody Rapture II – CD track #8 \"Proximity Effect\" (1992) Zoth Ommog\nZoth In Your Mind – CD track #3 \"Take Him Out Back\" (1993) Zoth Ommog\nThe Colours of Zoth Ommog – CD track #8 \"Beater\" (1994) Zoth Ommog\nTorture Tech Overdrive – CD track #13 \"Freedom\" (1994) Cleopatra Records\nTotentanz – The Best of Zoth Ommog 2xCD CD #2 track #7 \"Gods and Children\" – (1994) Cleopatra Records\nThere Is No Time – 4xCD CD #3 track #2 \"Gun Control\" (1995) Ras Dva Records\nOn the Line – CD track #4 \"Lynaka Says Don't Dream\" and track #5 \"Heaven in Hell\" (1996) Out of Line\nVertigo Compilation (04/1996) – CD track #4 \"Lynaka Says Don't Dream\" – (1996) Celtic Circle Productions\nAwake the Machines – On the Line Vol. 2 – 2xCD CD #1 track #15 \"Awake the Machine\" 1997, Out of Line / Sub/Mission Records\nThe Complete History of Zoth Ommog: Totentanz – 4xCD CD #2 track #7 \"Gods and Children\" – (1999) Cleopatra Records\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscogs.com – Yeht Mae Discography"

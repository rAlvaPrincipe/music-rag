    "text": "Coma Cinema is an American indie pop band formed by Mat Cothran in 2005. Cothran began writing songs for the band during his high school days in Spartanburg, but the band was later based in Asheville, North Carolina.\n\n\n== History ==\nCothran began writing songs under the name Coma Cinema early in his teens. After years of performing locally, Cothran released a collection of his recordings in January 2009, entitled Baby Prayers.\nBaby Prayers caught the attention of music blogs and websitesâ€”including Pitchfork.com, who posted the music video for \"Flower Pills\" in February 2010. In June 2010, Coma Cinema followed up with their second album, Stoned Alone.\nComa Cinema's third album, Blue Suicide, was released in March 2011 both digitally through Bandcamp and physical formats (Wonderbeard Tapes released cassette tapes; Fork and Spoon Records pressed the vinyl). Two tracks off Blue Suicide have already been released in a split 7-inch single with the band Teen Porn through AMDISCS: \"Wondering\" and \"Greater Vultures.\"\nComa Cinema released their fourth record, Posthumous Release, on June 11, 2013, on cassette tape through Orchid Tapes and on vinyl through Fork and Spoon Records.\nTheir fifth record, titled Loss Memory, was released on December 7, 2017.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nBaby Prayers (2009)\nStoned Alone (2010)\nBlue Suicide (2011)\nPosthumous Release (2013)\nLoss Memory (2017)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nAbandoned Lands (2011)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nComa Cinema (split 7-inch) (2010)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nBluest of Them All; Anthology (2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nComa Cinema on Facebook"

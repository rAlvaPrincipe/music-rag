    "text": "One True Voice were a British boy band created on the ITV television series Popstars: The Rivals. \n\n\n== Popstars: The Rivals ==\nIn the show, single gender pop groups were created through a public vote and competed in the UK Singles Chart for the 2002 Christmas number one single. One True Voice's debut single was double A-side \"Sacred Trust / After You're Gone\" which competed against ‘girl group’ Girls Aloud and their debut song \"Sound of the Underground\". Upon release, Girls Aloud topped the chart and One True Voice reached number two. \n\n\n=== After Popstars: The Rivals ===\nIn June 2003, Daniel Pearce left the group to pursue a solo career. The band released a further single in 2003 but cancelled a tour due to poor ticket sales, topping a poll for \"Britain's Worst Group\". By August 2003, they had fully disbanded without releasing an album.\n\n\n== Members ==\nAnton Gordon (born 6 May 1983, 40 years old) auditioned for The X Factor in 2006, but did not make it through the preliminary screening.

The band recorded one popular single, 365, then went on their only tour, on the Adriatic Coast in the summer of 2004. After 10 shows out of 29 scheduled, the tour was cancelled due to disagreements between the band and their managers.\nCroatia Records published their album Instant in 2004, with thirteen songs written mostly by Boris Đurđević and Faruk Buljubašić. The album was panned by critics.\nThe band entered into the HRT Dora Eurosong pre-selection competition in February 2005.\nSoon after the tour, the band's popularity decreased.

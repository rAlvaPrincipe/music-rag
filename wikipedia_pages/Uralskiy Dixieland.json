The band was highly acclaimed by GDR magazine: “Following the brilliant success of Leningrad Dixieland in 1979, 1980, and 1985, another jazz band from the Soviet Union — Uralskiy Dixieland from Chelyabinsk — became a major crowd-puller at the XVI International Dixieland Festival in Dresden.” \nIn 1986, an LP with select records of the performances at the XV and XVI International Dixieland Festivals in Dresden was released in the German Democratic Republic.

Chelyabinsk jazzmen gave thirteen concerts on the most festival stages: street and club scenes, concert halls and at official receptions. All concerts in Dresden were held in full house.

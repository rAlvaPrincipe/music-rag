    "text": "The Easy Riders were an American folk music band, that operated from 1956 to 1959, consisting of Terry Gilkyson, Richard Dehr, and Frank Miller. Their career was guided by Mitch Miller, who had them under contract for Columbia Records.\nTheir greatest hit, in early 1957, was the song \"Marianne\". The group also composed some tunes for the 1958 cinemiracle-documentary Windjammer, such as \"Kari Waits for Me\" and \"Sugar Cane\". One of Gilkyson's songs was a number one hit for Frankie Laine, \"The Cry of the Wild Goose\". Gilkyson wrote many tunes for Laine, and he and The Easy Riders were also featured on Frankie's 1957 hit, \"Love Is a Golden Ring\", having also penned the number for Laine.\nMany songs of the group became better known through the interpretation of other singers, such as The Kingston Trio, Gale Storm, Harry Belafonte, Doris Day, Burl Ives and The Brothers Four. Their song \"Memories Are Made of This\" became a top hit through the interpretation by Dean Martin. After the Easy Riders made a single with the  1927 song \"Send for de Captain\", the Beach Boys adapted it from The Kingston Trioâ€™s cover version and made of it their hit \"Sloop John B\".\nGilkyson left the group in the early 1960s to work for Disney studios and wrote the Oscar-nominated \"The Bare Necessities\" for Disney's The Jungle Book.\nDehr died in October 1989, and Gilkyson died in October 1999.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nMarianne and Other Songs You'll Like (1957, Columbia CL 990)\nBlue Mountain (1958, Columbia CL 1103)\nWanderin': Folk Songs by The Easy Riders (1959, Columbia CL 1272)\nRollin' (1960, Kapp KL-1196)\nRemember the Alamo (1961, Kapp KL-1216)\nThe Cry of the Wild Goose (1963, Kapp KS-3327)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Easy Riders biography at Yahoo!

    "text": "Fandango was an American pop rock band which began as a four-piece, playing in the local clubs in the Tri-state area: New Jersey, New York, Connecticut (circa 1976) before adding three more members prior to their first recording contract being signed in March 1977. It was fronted by vocalist Joe Lynn Turner (who by then had already changed his given name 'Linquito' through a suggestion by guitarist Rick Blakemore). Larry Dawson (stage name of Larry Dvoskin), one of the band's keyboardists, would later play for Uli Jon Roth.\nThe band opened for acts like The Allman Brothers, The Marshall Tucker Band, Wet Willie, Billy Joel, and Chicago. Phil Walden's Paragon Agency (who initially represented such artists as Otis Redding, Percy Sledge, and Sam & Dave in the early 60s) were responsible for booking Fandango. Turner has stated that the band took influences from the Eagles and southern rock. The group, after the release of their fourth album (Cadillac), disbanded shortly after their equipment was stolen at Chicago Fest. Turner's work with the band got him noticed by Barry Ambrosio (who was Ritchie Blackmore's personal assistant). He put Blackmore on the phone and asked Turner to audition for Rainbow.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Fandango (1977) ===\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\nSide One\n\"Headliner\" – (Denny LaRue, Rick Blakemore) – 3:40\n\"Down Down Down\" – (LaRue, Blakemore) – 4:41\n\"Jesse And Will\" – (Blakemore) – 4:49\n\"San Joaquin\" – (LaRue, Blakemore) – 4:02\n\"Life Of The Party\" – (music: Joe Delia / lyrics: LaRue,  Joe Delia, Joe Lynn Turner) – 4:43\nSide Two\n \"Shadow Boxing\" - (LaRue, Blakemore) - 3:01\n\"Helpless Heart\" – (Carole Meyers, LaRue, Blakemore) – 4:07\n\"Devil Rain\" – (LaRue, Blakemore) – 6:08\n\"Misery Road\" – (LaRue, Blakemore) – 4:15\n\"Goin' Down For The Last Time\" – (LaRue, Turner) – 4:11\n\n\n==== Personnel ====\nJoe Lynn Turner – lead vocals, guitar\nRick Blakemore – guitar, backing vocals\nDenny LaRue – keyboards, backing vocals\nBob Danyls – bass (1, 3-5, 8, 9), backing vocals\nAdditional Personnel\nDavid Campbell – string arrangements (3, 5, 7)\nCandy Kurgen – backing vocals (6)\nDavid Sanborn – saxophone (5)\nJohn Tropea – guitar (7, 10)\nJoe Delia – piano, clavinet, synthesizer, organ, string arrangements (10)\nDon Payne – bass (2, 6, 7, 10)\nAbe Speller – drums (all but 4)\nLou Mondinelli – drums (4), tambourine (2, 7), handclaps] (7)\nWalter Santos – congas (2, 6)\nLou Mondelli – marimba (9), congas (9), timbales (9)\n\n\n=== Last Kiss (1978) ===\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\nSide One\n\"Last Kiss\" – (Bob Danyls, Dennis La Rue, Joe Lynn Turner, Larry Dawson, Richard Mason Blakemore) – 4:04\n\"Sure Got The Power\" – (La Rue, Blakemore) – 4:17\n\"Mexico\" – (La Rue, Turner, Blakemore) – 5:52\n\"Losin' Kind Of Love\" – (Turner) – 3:38\n\"Hotel LaRue\" – (La Rue, Blakemore) – 5:16\nSide Two\n \"Feel The Pain\" - (La Rue, Turner, Blakemore) - 5:12\n\"CIty Of Angels\" – (La Rue, Blakemore) – 7:09\n\"The Mill's On Fire\" – (La Rue, Blakemore) – 5:49\n\"I Keep Going/Hard Bargain\" – (La Rue) – 5:36\n\n\n==== Personnel ====\nJoe Lynn Turner – lead vocals (all but 9), lead guitar\nRick Blakemore – lead and slide guitars, backing and lead (9b) vocals\nDennis LaRue – organ, backing vocals, piano\nLarry Dawson – piano, clavinet, organ, synthesizer\nBob Danyls – bass, backing and lead (9a) vocals\nLou Mondelli – drums, backing vocals\nWalter Santos – percussion\nJimmy Hall – backing vocals (2), harmonica (4)\n\n\n=== One Night Stand (1979) ===\n\n\n==== Track listing ====\nSide One\n\"One Night Stand\" – (Dennis La Rue) – 2:40\n\"Thief In The Night\" – (La Rue, Joe Lynn Turner, Rick Blakemore) – 3:48\n\"Hard Man (Bless My Soul)\" – (Bob Danyls, La Rue, Turner, Blakemore) – 3:56\n\"Hard Headed Woman\" – (La Rue, Blakemore) – 3:28\n\"I Would Never Leave\" – (La Rue, Turner, Larry Dawson, Blakemore) – 5:21\nSide Two\n \"Dancer\" - (La Rue, Turner, Blakemore) - 3:33\n\"Little Cherie\" – (La Rue, Blakemore) – 4:05\n\"Late Nights\" – (La Rue) – 3:15\n\"Two Time Loser\" – (Turner, Blakemore) – 4:29\n\"Ain't No Way\" – (Danyls, Turner, Dawson, Blakemore) – 3:48\n\n\n==== Personnel ====\nJoe Lynn Turner – lead (1, 2, 5-8) and co-lead (4, 9) vocals, guitar\nRick Blakemore – guitar, backing, lead (3) and co-lead (4, 9) vocals\nDennis LaRue – keyboards, backing vocals\nLarry Dawson – keyboards\nBob Danyls – bass, backing and lead (10) vocals\nLou Mondelli – drums\nWalter Santos – percussion\n\n\n=== Cadillac (1980) ===\nCadliac was Fandango's final album before Joe Lynn Turner joined Rainbow in the fall of 1980.

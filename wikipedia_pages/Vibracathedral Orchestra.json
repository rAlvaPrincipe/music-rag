    "text": "Vibracathedral Orchestra is an England-based drone ensemble that has been active since 1998.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe group were formed in Leeds in 1998 when Mick Flower, Neil Campbell and Julian Bradley, who had released a number of homemade cassettes together, joined with Bridget Hayden and Adam Davenport.\nMost of the group's earliest recordings, most made by recording live to 2-track, were self-released though many underground labels, including VHF Records, Giardia, Eclipse, U-Sound, Qbico, Textile and Freedom From, have also put out a number of Vibracathedral records. They have twice been featured in session on Resonance FM, given an hour-long slot each time.\nAlthough very much a fixed unit, the line-up has been occasionally augmented by the likes of Matthew Bower, John Godbert, Richard Youngs, John Clyde Evans (latterly known as Tirath Singh Nirmala), and Tom Greenwood (of Jackie-O Motherfucker). Julian Bradley left the group in 2004 with both Neil Campbell and Bridget Hayden following him in 2006. A new album, Wisdom Thunderbolt, featuring Chris Corsano and Matthew Bower as guests, was released on VHF in 2007. The group performed at the Colour Out of Space festival in Brighton in August 2008 with a line-up of Flower, Davenport and Bradley.\nAccording to John F Szwed's biography of Sun Ra, Space is the Place, the original Vibra-Cathedral Orchestra was a 1930s jazz band from Ra's home town of Birmingham, Alabama, which was previously called the Sax-O-Society Orchestra.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nMothing CD-R (1998), self-released\nCopse CD-R (1998), self-released\nFalling Free You and Me/Filling Sacks with Coloured Scraps 10-inch (1999), self-released\nThe Vibracathedral String Quartet CD-R (1999), self-released\nMusic for Red Breath CD-R (2000), self-released\nVibracathedral String Band / Vibracathedral Drum Troupe 7-inch (2000), Freedom From\nLino Hi CD (2000), Giardia\nHollin CD-R (2000), self-released\nVersatile Arab Chord Chart CD (2001), VHF\nLong Live the Weeds CD-R (2001), self-released\nTheir Spines Crumble for a Hug cassette (2001), self-released\nMy Gate's Open, Tremble by My Side (2001), Roaratorio\nHot Booty CD-R (2001), VHF\nLive in Newcastle and Leeds 1999 cassette (2001), Matching Head Tapes\nThe One You Call the Ghost Train 7-inch (2001), Tonschact\nDabbling with Gravity and Who You Are (2002), VHF\nWearing Clothes of Ash / Baptism Bar Blues split with Jackie-O Motherfucker (2002), Textile\nsplit with Low (2002), Misplaced Music\nMMICD CD-R (2003), self-released\nGirls with Rocks in Their Hands 7-inch (2003), Great Pop Supplement\nRain Gutter Teasing Rusty Cat Sneezing split 7-inch with Phonophani (2003), Safe as Milk\nHex Hostess CD-R (2003), self-released\nWings over America split with Sunroof!

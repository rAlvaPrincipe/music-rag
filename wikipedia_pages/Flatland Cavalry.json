    "text": "Flatland Cavalry is a country and Americana band from Lubbock, Texas.  The band's original members were vocalist Cleto Cordero, drummer Jason Albers, bassist Jonathan Saenz, guitarist Reid Dillon, and violinist Laura Jane. Jane departed the band in July 2018 and was replaced by Wesley Hall.\nFlatland Cavalry was formed in 2012 by Cordero and Albers, who were college roommates in Midland and performed together before moving to Lubbock, where the rest of the members came together by 2014.  In May 2015, the band's debut EP, titled Come May, was released after a crowd-funding campaign was used to finance its production.  On April 1, 2016, their first full-length album, Humble Folks, was released to positive reviews and comparisons to the music of the Turnpike Troubadours.  Humble Folks peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Americana/Folk albums chart and number 38 on the Top Country Albums chart.  The band's second studio album, Homeland Insecurity, was released on January 18, 2019.\nKaitlin Butts, who is married to Cordero and an accomplished musician in her own right, is a frequent collaborator with the band and a oft-seen part of their live shows. \n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe roots for the formation of Flatland Cavalry were first laid when Cleto Cordero and Jason Albers began playing at local venues while rooming together at Midland College. The two had been jamming together since junior high but it was not until they moved to Lubbock in 2012 that the band began to take shape. It was here, while studying at Texas Tech University, that the duo met Laura Jane at a house party. Jonathan Saenz and Reid Dillon joined the rest in 2014 and the band's lineup was complete.\nCordero himself began playing the guitar at age 14 and wrote his first song by the time he was 17 years old for Lee High School's Rebel Lee Court Awards Ceremony. He writes most of the band's songs apart from playing the role of lead guitarist and singer with Jason Albers on drums, Jonathan Saenz on bass, Reid Dillon on guitar and Wesley Hall on fiddle. Hall took the place of Laura Jane when she parted ways with the band in 2018.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n==== Come May (2015) ====\nThe band released its first EP in 2015, gathering funds for its production via a crowdfunding platform.

    "text": "T.H.C. was an American trip hop band from Los Angeles, California, formed by producer/composer/keyboardist/bassist George Sarah in 1992. Vocalist and lyricist Sarah Folkman joined the band official in 1997 though she was a guest collaborator since 1995.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFrom 1992 to 1999 the band released two full-length albums, one E.P. and two 12 inch records. George disbanded the band to work on solo projects.\nIn 1995 George Sarah as T.H.C. signed with Fifth Colvmn records and released Death by Design in January 1996. The album consisted of hard techno and ambient electronic music. Half the album was co-produced by Q A.K.A. Uberzone. Later that year an EP was released titled Consenting Guinea Pig. In 1996 George Sarah toured the eastern USA on a three-week tour to perform both releases. In September of that year as T.H.C. George joined fellow Fifth Colvmn label mates 'Death Ride 69' performing bass on a 6-week tour supporting My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult across the U.S.A.\nIn 1997 San Diego base Intelligent Records released two T.H.C. 12\" instrumentals produced and performed by George Sarah.\nIn 1998 Nettwerk Records flew both George and Sarah Folkman to Canada to record demo's for the label. The sessions were engineered by KMFDM Gunter Schultz. Later that year T.H.C. performed a two-week residency in Paris, France accompanied by a string trio (cello, viola, violin) which had become the live presentation of the band.\nIn 1999, Sarah and Folkman released a full-length album together called Adagio. The album consisted of a somber beauty of melancholic charged electronica, and marked a formal departure from the harsh techno/trance style of previous releases.\nT.H.C. gained some recognition after their music appeared in a couple of episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (as well as its spin-off, Angel), playing the part of the fictional band Shy, of whom Veruca was the vocalist. George Sarah also appeared on the show as Shy's keyboard player. George Sarah returned to Buffy the Vampire Slayer on season six in the episode Hells Bells along with his string section during the wedding ceremony. T.H.C also had their music appear in several films including The Curve directed by Dan Rosen and starring Matthew Lillard, Michael Vartan, and Keri Russell, Mascara directed by Linda Kandel and starring Ione Skye, Cleopatra’s second husband directed by Jon Reiss.\n\n\n== Members ==\nSarah Folkman — Vocals/Lyricist\nGeorge Sarah — Electronic composer/Multi-instrumentalist\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nDeath by Design – (1996, Full Contact)\nAdagio – (1999, Brain Surgery)\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nConsenting Guinea Pig – (1996, Full Contact)\n\n\n=== 12-inch records ===\n\"Darjeeling\" – (1997)\n\"Blue Wave\" – (1998)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nUnsaid Warning L.A.Critical Mass (1998)\nBranded (Instrumental) KUCI BENEFIT (1998)\nDirectly From Angels King of Vampires (1998)\nTetanus Toxin World Wide Underground (1997)\nMind Over Matter Ultimate Drum n' Bass (1997)\nNeed To Destroy Fifth Column (1996)\nSin-A-Matic Vol. 1 Svenhed (1994)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeorge Sarah – Official Website\nGeorge Sarah's Official Facebook Site"

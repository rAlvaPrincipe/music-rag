Wise and Camino remained in touch and collaborated frequently and previously worked together on the tracks \"Anuva Wun\" as a single by Camino and \"I Can Tell\" from Wise's 2017 debut album Inglorious. Wise and Camino began teasing their collaborative project during the summer of 2017. The duo introduced the name \"88Glam\" on November 1, 2017, premiering their first music video \"12\" via Billboard which featured a cameo from the Weeknd. This was followed by the release of another music video for \"Bali\", which features Nav, and the release of their self-titled debut mixtape 88Glam on November 7, 2017.\nIn 2018, 88Glam officially signed to XO and Republic Records. On April 20, 2018, 88Glam was re-released as 88Glam Reloaded through XO and Republic, with four new tracks including a remix with 2 Chainz.\nOn November 8, 2018, 88Glam released a new single titled \"Lil Boat\" from an upcoming album titled 88Glam2.

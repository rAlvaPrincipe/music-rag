    "text": "Alexander \"Sasha\" Argov (Hebrew: סשה ארגוב, born Alexander Abramovich; Moscow, 26 October 1914 – Tel Aviv, 27 September 1995) was a prominent Israeli composer.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\nArgov was born Alexander Abramovich in Moscow, Russia in 1914.  Later he changed his last name to its Hebrew version, Argov, in 1946. His father was a dentist and his mother a concert pianist. He began studying the piano with his mother at the age of three, and at the age of six he began to compose music by ear which his mother transcribed into music notation for him. He had no formal education in music outside of his lessons with his mother.\nHe migrated to British Palestine from Russia in 1934 with his parents. He never made a living with his music, working first as a bank clerk and later owning and operating a bookshop.\nArgov composed many popular songs, producing approximately 1,200 works. Among them were \"Hareut\" and songs for the Israel Defense Forces, film, and theater. In 1948 he published Ha’Chizbatron, a collection of his songs written for the entertainment of Israeli troupes. He collaborated with Chaim Hefer and Matti Caspi, two of whose albums feature melodies written exclusively by Argov. He also composed several film scores and musicals for the stage; of which the most successful was Shlomo hamelech ve’Shalmai hansandlar (‘King Solomon and the Cobbler’) which premiered in 1964. In 1988 he was awarded the Israel Prize in Hebrew song.\n\n\n== Dramatic works ==\nRak lo be’Shabat (film score, 1964)\nShlomo hamelech ve’Shalmai hasandlar (musical, 1964)\nHarpatka bakirkas (children’s play with music, 1965)\nAndroceles ve’ha’arie (children’s play with music, 1966)\nEster hamalka (musical, 1966)\nHu halach basadot (film score, 1967)\nChagigat kaiz (musical, 1972)\nDoda Klara (film score, 1977)\n\n\n=== commemoration ===\nSasha Argov died in 1995, at the age of 80.

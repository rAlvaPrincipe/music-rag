    "text": "Null Device  is an electronic band from Wisconsin, USA.\n\n\n== Band History ==\nFounded in 1995 by students at the University of Wisconsin, Null Device initially focused on instrumental electronic music before transitioning to more traditional synthpop.  After a series of independently-released demos, they were signed to Nilaihah Records in 2002, and released several subsequent albums via that label.  In that time they incorporated influences of Arabic and Indian traditional instrumentation.\nAfter the dissolution of the label, they went on to release two more records independently, before signing to Distortion Productions.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\nEric Oehler - Vocals, Violin, Synthesizer, Percussion, Bass, Songwriting\nEric Goedken - Lyrics, Production\nJill Sheridan - Keyboards, Songwriting, Vocals, Production\nKendra Kreutz - Cello\n\n\n=== Former ===\nElizabeth Scheef - Dumbek, Frame drum\nDan Clark - Guitar\nCharles \"Chuck4\" McKenzie - Bass\nTom Lawrence - Synthesizer\nWilliam Annis - Synthesizer\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1999 - The Year in Pixels\n2002 - Sublimation\n2004 - A Million Different Moments\n2007 - Excursions\n2010 - Suspending Belief\n2013 - While You Were Otherwise Engaged\n2016 - Perihelion\n2019 - Line Of Sight\n2022 - The Emerald Age\n\n\n=== EPs and Singles ===\n2000 - Crimson\n2000 - Submariner/Love Stain (Split EP with Polymorphous Perverse)\n2001 - Subliminal\n2003 - Footfalls (EP)\n2005 - The London (EP)\n2009 - Recursions\n2010 - Fading Belief w/ The Dark Clan\n2011 - Something More Exciting Than A Tornado (Live)\n2011 - Misadventures in Dub 1\n2011 - Monkey Gone to Heaven\n2012 - Meds\n2012 - Triangular (2012 Version)\n2014 - Night Owl\n2014 - Aphelion\n2015 - Wardrobe\n2016 - What's On Your Mind\n2017 - All You Fascists Bound To Lose\n2018 - Only You\n2021 - Red Right Hand\n2021 - Run/Let You In\n2022 - Flags\n2023 - True Faith\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site\nMusic Site\nNilaihah Records\nInterview @ Legends[usurped]"

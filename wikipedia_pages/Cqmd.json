    "text": "CQMD Is a heavy funk band from France using amplified 1930's brass band instruments.\nCQMD are the initials for Ceux Qui Marchent Debout and is the band's name outside its national territory.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCreated in 1992 by Superclark, producer of Malka Family and founder of Patate Records, \"Bart\" and \"Androuze\", trumpet and trombone player of \"La Marabunta\", and Roufi, sousaphone player in Boula Matari. The band was originally called Les Fils de Crao playing mostly in alternative venues and bars of the Paris area. Because another band has the same name they switched to  \"Ceux qui marchent debout\", a name that makes direct reference to the comic's character Rahan.\nIn July 1995, at the Bataclan de Paris, they shared their first big stage with American bass player and singer Bootsy Collins. A few months later, they were asked by French film director Cédric Klapisch to compose the music of his next movie, Chacun cherche son chat (\"When The Cat's Away\"). The band has played much since, opening or contributing with composers and musicians Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker, The Neville Brothers, Galactic, or David Byrne who featured their song \"Horses\" on The Cuisine Non-Stop compilation on his label Luaka Bop.\nThis band, which was briefly signed on the major EMI for its second album, is independent.\n\n\n== Line up ==\nBruno Gautheron – trumpet, vocals\nSylvain \"Bart\" Lacombe – trombone, vocals\nArnaud Fioravanti – saxophone\nJulien Petit – sousaphone\nFabrice Lerigab – snare drum. vocals\nBoris de Loeper – bass drum, percussions, vocals\nBruno \"Superclark\" Clark – banjo, vocals\n\nOld members :\n\nSerge \"Roufi\" Calka (sousaphone, vocals)\nCyril \"Vitch\" Noacco (bass drum, vocals)\nEric \"Tafani\" Dubessay (snare drum, vocals)\nArthur Simon (trumpet)\nOunsa Mebarkia (vocals)\nPhilippe \"Androuze\" Andrieu (trumpet).\n\n\n== Discography ==\nNageant dans le brouillard (1993 – k7 under the name Les Fils de Crao)\nDebout (1996)\nYour Boddy (1998)\nLalalalalala (2000)\nFunky Stuff in a Reggae Style (2001)\nCQMD (2003)\nDVD Live + Bonus (2005)\nThe Jackpot (2007)\nCheck That Funk (2008)\nShoot The Freak (2011) featuring Angelo Moore, Femi Kuti, Yellowman.\nDon't Be Shy (2016) featuring Rosemary Standley.\nFrom Blues To Funk (2022).\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nCqmd entry on David Byrne's personal blog [1]"

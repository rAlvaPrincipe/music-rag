    "text": "Celer is an American drone music project formed in 2005 by composer and musician Will Long and Danielle Baquet-Long.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 2005, at the beginning of their relationship in Huntington Beach, California, U.S.A., Celer was created as a musical and artistic collaboration between Danielle Baquet-Long and Will Long.\nBetween 2005 and 2007, the couple created 22 releases, which they self-released, packaged in handmade, hand-painted packages, with designs, and individual stencils. The handmade packaging designs have been described as \"deliciously mysterious\", where \"Muted and bleach colours stretch as far as the eye can see in these panoramic paintings for the mind\", and the music as \"deeply personal, or unwittingly obscure\", and \"gentle, haunting and evocative\", created \"primarily from personal memories and thought experiments\".\nAfter producing music for record labels, installations, and exhibits worldwide from 2005 to 2009, Danielle Baquet-Long died on July 8, 2009, of heart failure. From 2009 to the present, Celer has been the solo ambient project of Will Long.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nWhite Prism (Self-released, 2004)\nAriill (Self-released, 2005)\nBelsslsssll (Self-released, 2005)\nCeylon (Self-released, 2006)\nContinents (Self-released, 2006; Two Acorns re-issue, 2021)\nDescender (Self-released, 2006)\nMelodia (Self-released, 2006)\nSampling Pond (Self-released, 2006)\nSunlir/Scols (Self-released, 2006)\nTingshas (Self-released, 2006)\nAmmonia (Self-released, 2007)\nCantus Libres (Self-released, 2007; Two Acorns re-issue, 2021)\nDilue (Diluted) (Self-released, 2007)\nNeon (Self-released, 2007; Two Acorns re-issue, 2021)\nPara (Self-released, 2007)\nRed Seals (Self-released, 2007)\nSadha (Self-released, 2007; Two Acorns re-issue, 2021)\nSieline (Self-released, 2007)\nDiscourses Of The Withered (Infraction, 2008)\nThe Everything And The Nothing (Infraction, 2008)\nNacreous Clouds (And/oar, 2008)\nTropical (Mystery Sea, 2008)\nCursory Asperses (Slow Flow Records, 2008)\nI Love You So Much I Can't Even Title This (The Light That Never Goes Out Went Out) (Self-released, 2008)\nCapri (Humming Conch, 2009)\nCompositions For Cassette (Digitalis Limited, 2009)\nBreeze Of Roses (Dragons Eye Recordings, 2009)\nEngaged Touches (Home Normal, 2009)\nLevitation And Breaking Points (Self-released, 2009)\nFountain Glider (Students Of Decay, 2009)\nPoulaine (Students Of Decay, 2009)\nBrittle (Low Point, 2009)\nClose Proximity And The Unhindered Care-All (Sentient Recognition Archive, 2009)\nIn Escaping Lakes (Slow Flow Records, 2009)\nPockets Of Wheat (Soundscaping Records, 2010)\nRags Of Contentment (Digitalis Limited, 2010)\nDwell In Possibility (Blackest Rainbow, 2010)\nDying Star (Dragons Eye Recordings, 2010)\nPanoramic Dreams Bathed In Seldomness (Basses Frequences, 2010)\nHoney Moon (Stunned Records, 2010)\nVestiges Of An Inherent Melancholy (Blackest Rainbow, 2010)\nSalvaged Violets (Infraction, 2010)\nEver, Irreplaceable Beauty (Self-released, 2011)\nFoolish Causes Of Fail And Ruin (Self-released, 2011)\nMenggayakan (Analog Path, 2011)\nSunlir (Con-V, 2011)\nTightrope (Low Point, 2012)\nEvaporate And Wonder (Experimedia, 2012)\nIn The Finger-Painted Fields Of The Eyes (Prairie Fire, 2012)\nDearest Ices (Northern Twilights, 2012)\nLightness And Irresponsibility (Constellation Tatsu, 2012)\nEpicentral Examples Of The More Or Less (Futuresequence, 2012)\nRedness + Perplexity (Somehow Recordings, 2012)\nRelief and Altruism (Self-released, 2012)\nAn Immensity Merely To Save Life (Self-released, 2012)\nWithout Retrospect, the Morning (Glacial Movements, 2012)\nPerfectly Beneath Us (Still*Sleep, 2012)\nI, Anatomy (Streamline, 2012)\nRadish (Commune Disc, 2013)\nViewpoint (Murmur Records, 2013)\nClimbing Formation (Entropy Records, 2013)\nDiving Into the Plasma Pool (Self-released, 2013)\nVoyeur (Humming Conch, 2014)\nZigzag (Spekk, 2014)\nSky Limits (Two Acorns, 2014)\nSky Limits (Baskaru, 2014)\nJima (I, Absentee, 2015)\nHow Could You Believe Me When I Said I Loved You When You Know I've Been A Liar All My Life (Two Acorns and White Paddy Mountain, 2015)\nTempelhof (Two Acorns, 2015)\nAkagi (Two Acorns, 2016)\nInside The Head Of Gods (Two Acorns, 2016)\nI Love You So Much I Can't Even Title This (Infraction, 2016)\nTwo Days and One Night (Sequel, 2016)\nCallisto (Two Acorns, 2016)\nIn The End You'll Just Disappear (Two Acorns, 2017)\nAlcoves (Cellar Door Tapes, 2017)\nAlcoves (Two Acorns, 2017)\nAnother Blue Day (Glistening Examples, 2017)\nSomething Cathartic (Polar Seas Recordings, 2018)\nShima (Gailur, 2018)\nNacreous Clouds (Two Acorns, 2018)\nXièxie (Two Acorns, 2019)\nPlays Godflesh (Avalanche Recordings, 2019)\nVamps (Patient Sounds, 2019)\nScols (Two Acorns, 2020)\nContinents (Two Acorns, 2020)\nSadha (Two Acorns, 2021)\nCantus Libres (Two Acorns, 2021)\nMalaria (Two Acorns, 2021)\nCoral Sea (Two Acorns, 2021)\nNeon (Two Acorns, 2021)\nIn Light Of Blues (Room40, 2021)\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nMesoscaphe with Mathieu Ruhlmann (Spekk, 2008)\nGeneric City with Yui Onodera (Two Acorns, 2010)\nMaastunnel/Mt.

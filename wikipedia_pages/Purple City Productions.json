Purple City began in 2001 when Shiest Bub met Cam'Ron of The Diplomats at a shoe store. After exchanging numbers and weed, a connection was made. Shiest had the Purple, and soon enough Shiest was running around with Dip Set and Purple City was born. Cam'Ron served as mentors to Shiest, leading him to create Purple City and began to put out mixtapes. To date, Purple City has released eight mixtapes, selling an estimated 11,234 copies, and launching the career of E-Norm. Purple City has also commercially released three albums, Paris to Purple City, The Purple Album, and Road to the Riches: The Best of the Purple City Mixtapes\n\n\n== Former members ==\nUn Kasa\nAgallah\nE-Norm\nSmoke DZA\nMike Boogie\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nPurple City Matrix (July 22, 2003)\nRoad to the Riches: The Best of the Purple City Mixtapes (March 22, 2005)\nParis to Purple City (November 8, 2005)\nBorn to the Purple (May 23, 2006)\nThe Purple Album (May 23, 2006)\nBorn to The Purple DVD (With Bonus Swagger Development Mixtape (May 23, 2006)\nInternational Bud Dealer 2009\n\n\n=== Mixtapes ===\nGladiator (Hosted by Cormega (July 9, 2003)\nThe Incredible Piff\nThe Purple City Family in Candyland\nShiest Bub-z Presents: The Color Purple\nShiest Bub-z Presents: Summer Grind\nShiest Bub-z & DJ Mo Sticky Presents: Bubble Music\nShiest Bub-z Presents The Matrix 2: Vol. 4 Reloaded Hosted by.

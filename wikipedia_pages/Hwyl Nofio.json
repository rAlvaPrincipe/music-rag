    "text": "Hwyl Nofio (from Welsh meaning 'swimming fun') is a Welsh experimental music group formed by Steve Parry.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormed in 1997, Hwyl Nofios' approach touches on various diverse styles and genres, including, industrial music, drone, ambient and noise. Hwyl Nofio is an evolving ensemble based around its originator Steve Parry, who previously had been a founding member of the Surrealist music group Neu Electrikk and also worked with Matt Johnson of The The and Colin Potter of Nurse with Wound. Hwyl Nofio referred to the approach as a marriage of dilemmas being resolved in another space whereby the music explores and exploits an ongoing collision between harmony and disharmony.\nHwyl Nofios' influences include The Velvet Underground, Neu, Jimi Hendrix, John Cage and Harry Partch,\nThe band has over the years has consisted of Steve Parry avant-garde guitarist and multi-instrumentalist with Trevor Stainsby, Sandor Szabo, Fredrik Soegaard, Balazs Major, and Mark Beazley of the instrumental ambient group Rothko, and Gorwel Owen.

In 2020, as Hwyl Nofio Parry also collaborated with artists such as Rhodri Davies and Steve James Sherlock on \"Isolate\".\n\n\n== Installations and performance art ==\nIn 2016, Parry he was commissioned to create a sound/visual installation, called The Beholder's Share.\nThe installation was a play on perception where the ambiguity in the piece elicits both a conscious and unconscious process of recognition in the observer, who responds emotionally and emphatically to the work in terms of their own life experience, therefore the artist creates the work based on their own personal sensory information and the beholder re-creates it by responding to its inherent ambiguity and makes it personal to them. His installation was exhibited at the Art Market in York.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Singers And Harp Players Are Dumb (1999)\nHymnal (2002)\nAnatomy of Distort (2003)\nHounded by Fury (2006)\nChrist Distort EP\nDark (2012)\nFrom Elevated Gangways Rivers of Molten Metal Flow (2017)\nIsolate (2020)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nThe Wire Tapper 15 (Various Artists)(Hwyl Nofio) track (Broken Again);CD )\nBrave New Wales (Various Artists) (Fourier Transform, 2008;CD box set)\n\n\n=== Unreleased, limited edition and promo-only albums ===\nThe following full-length albums have never seen commercial release.

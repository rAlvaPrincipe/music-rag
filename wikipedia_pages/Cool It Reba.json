    "text": "Cool It Reba was an American band from New York City, that was part of the downtown post-punk and no wave scene in the early 1980s. Their music combined elements of James Brown funk, Television's guitar interplay and David Byrne's lyrical paranoia to a danceable beat.\nThe name came from a catch phrase that Soupy Sales often said on his show.\nThe band was formed in the Autumn of 1981 by vocalist and guitarist David Hansen, who was previously a member of Rhode Island's The Young Adults, and drummer Kevin Tooley who was in The Mundanes. The original line-up was completed by John Fredericks on lead guitar and bassist Baker Rorick (who later played in The Baxters, The Scarecrows and Purple K'niF).\nThey regularly played such venues as CBGB's, The Peppermint Lounge, The Mudd Club and Danceteria NYC. After only their fourth gig they signed to Hannibal Records in 1982. Shortly thereafter, they released the Joe Boyd-produced Money Fall Out The Sky EP. Containing such songs as \"I Saw Snakes\", \"Out Where The Buses Don't Run\" and the title track, it was met with critical acclaim, making many critics' annual top-ten lists.\nThe band then played alongside the likes of Billy Idol, John Cale and R.E.M. Label restaffing and losing key members led to the ultimate breakup of the band in the summer of 1984, although half of the band members later played together in the band Steve McQueen. Although Cool It Reba only released one record during their existence, many bootlegs of their live shows and unreleased studio recordings have circulated.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nMoney Fall Out The Sky, 1982, Hannibal Records\n\n\n== Original members ==\nDavid Hansen (lead vocals, rhythm guitar)\nJohn Fredericks (lead guitar, vocals)\nBaker Rorick (bass)\nKevin Tooley (drums, percussion)\n\n\n== Later members ==\nGordon Wands (bass 1983â€“84)\nJohn McCurry (lead guitar 1983)\nSid McGinnis (lead guitar 1983)\nJack Rigg (lead guitar 1984)\nSturgis Nikides (lead guitar 1984)\n\n\n== External links ==\nCool It Reba Resource center blog Photos, reviews, listings, articles and various things.\nCool It Reba Myspace Page containing photos, reviews and listings.\nYahoo Groups Page for Cool It Reba reviews, lyrics, gigography, photos and all Reba-related artists.\nReview of 2/13/82 Lupo's Show The Providence Journal February 15, 1982 Page B-04 By Tony Lioce.\nVillage Voice Review Robert Christgau's review.\nReview of 1/7/84 Peppermint Lounge show The New York Times January 9, 1984 C14 By Jon Pareles.\nThe Dean's List The Village Voice's 1983 Pazz & Jop Poll.\nCool It Reba Guitarist Jack Rigg Turns Doctor The Fort Gordon Signal July 30, 2010."

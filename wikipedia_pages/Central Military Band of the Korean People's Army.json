    "text": "The Central Military Band of the Korean People's Army (Korean: 조선인민군군악단), also sometimes known as the Korean People's Army Marching Band or DPRK Army Orchestra is a North Korean musical group/marching band based in Pyongyang and is the sole military band of the Korean People's Army. The Women's Military Marching Band of the Ministry of People's Security of the DPRK is the all-female unit of the central band.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn February 23, 1946, the Military Band of the Pyongyang Military School was created, which became the predecessor of the Band of the Korean People's Army. Its first performance was at the inaugural ceremony of the Pyongyang Institute founded by President Kim Il Sung. In June 1950, it became the Band of the Ministry of People's Security, and later that year, the band became attached as a unit of the Supreme Guard Command's Honor Guard Battalion. By September 1954, full control of the band was given to the Ministry of Public Security, serving for the remainder of the Cold War and the 1990s before being reorganized into a separate entity in June 1998 as a directly reporting unit of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, tasked as the primary unit for the military music activities throughout the whole KPA.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe CMB-KPA, as the premier and principal band of the whole KPA, presides over all garrison and unit bands within the KPA's service branches and the Worker-Peasant Red Guards. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has described the band as one that is \"instilling revolutionary enthusiasm and fighting spirit into all the service personnel and people.\"\n\nThe band is similar to United States college marching bands in that they both solely specialize in military style marching, notably during ceremonial parades and public performances. The band has been known to play pop, brass & military music during many of its performances.\n\n\n=== Parades and ceremonies ===\nMilitary parades in North Korea\nParty Foundation Day (parades on jubilee years)\nMilitary Foundation Day (parades on jubilee years)\nDay of the Foundation of the Republic (parades on jubilee years)\nDay of the Sun (2012, 2017, 2022 parades)\nState funeral of Kim Il-sung\nState funeral of Kim Jong-il\n\n\n=== Performances ===\n\n\n==== Notable concerts ====\nConcert for the state visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin (2000)\nJoint concert with the Central Military Band of the People's Liberation Army of China in honor of the 60th anniversary of the Korean Armistice (2013)\nJoint concert with the Central Military Band of the Ministry of Defense of Russia in Pyongyang (2014)\n70th anniversary concert (2016)\n\n\n==== Festivals ====\n\nThe Amur Waves International Military Bands Festival (2012 and 2015)\nSpasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo (2019)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nKorean People's Army\nMusic of North Korea\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe band marching during the celebrations of Army Day\nDPRK North Korea Girl's Brass Band\nJoint Performance of Military Bands of North Korea and Russia\nNorth Korean Military Band toured Russia\nNorth Korean Military Band marches through Pyongyang in Memory of 60th Anniversary of War Victory\nNorth Korean army band performs at Moscow's Red Square\n\"- YouTube\" 中国人民解放军军乐团行进演奏 [Performance by the People's Liberation of Army Band].

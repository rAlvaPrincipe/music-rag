    "text": "The Glenn Miller Orchestra is a band formed after the loss of Glenn Miller, named in memory of him and the original Glenn Miller Orchestra.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1946 revival ===\nThere was a short revival of a band named Glenn Miller Orchestra in the 1940s.\nGlenn Miller broke up the original Glenn Miller Orchestra in 1942 to join the United States Army Air Forces and lead the Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra. Miller died in 1944. In 1946, Miller's widow had a new band formed under the name Glenn Miller Orchestra, led by Miller's saxophonist and vocalist Tex Beneke. \nMany members of Miller's Army Air Forces Orchestra joined  the band, which until 1948 featured a large string section as had Miller's Army Air Forces band (but unlike the original Glenn Miller Orchestra). The band was successful, but Beneke didn't like having to follow Miller's old arrangements precisely. The Miller estate wanted a band that was primarily associated with Glenn Miller, playing the Glenn Miller songs in the \"Glenn Miller style.\" By 1950, Beneke and the Miller estate parted ways and the band dissolved. Beneke formed his own band, \"Tex Beneke and His Orchestra: Playing the Music Made Famous by Glenn Miller\"\n\n\n=== 1956 and on ===\nThere was a second revival of the name Glenn Miller Orchestra in 1956, which has continued well into the 21st century. It is this version with which this article is primarily concerned.\nAfter the release of the successful film The Glenn Miller Story, Miller's widow invited Ray McKinley, who had assumed leadership of the Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra 1945, to lead a new Glenn Miller Orchestra. McKinley remained with the Miller band until 1966.\nThe Glenn Miller Orchestra has recorded and performed under various leaders, from 1956 to this day. Clarinetist Buddy DeFranco became the musical director in 1966.\nLarry O'Brien served as director of the World-Famous Glenn Miller Orchestra from 1981 to 1983 and from 1988 to 2010.\nSinger Nick Hilscher became the director of the touring band in 2012, replacing previous director Gary Tole. Saxophonist/vocalist Erik Stabnau became music director in August 2021.\nThe Glenn Miller estate has authorized other bands to perform as \"The Glenn Miller Orchestra\" internationally. These groups are based in England, Europe, and Scandinavia.\n\n\n== Members of the American band ==\nCurrent as of 2022\n\nErik Stabnau – Music Director / Vocalist / Tenor Saxophone\nJenny Swoish – Female Vocalist\nKevin Sheehan – Lead Alto Saxophone, Clarinet, Flute, Arranger\nGary Meggs – 2nd Alto Saxophone, Clarinet\nAllen Cordingley – Tenor Saxophone 1, Clarinet, Flute\nJustin Williams – Tenor Saxophone 2, Clarinet, flute\nNoah Barrios – Baritone Saxophone, Alto Saxophone, Bass Clarinet, Flute\nAshley Hall – Lead Trumpet\nMatthew Gates – Split Lead /2nd Trumpet\nJoe Young IV – Jazz/3rd Trumpet\nGeorge Reinert III – Lead Trombone\nDave Ashley – 2nd Trombone\nJason Bennett – 3rd Trombone\nGil Scott Chapman – Piano/Sound Tech\nDean Schweiger – Drums\nCharlie Himel – Upright Bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1983: In the Digital Mood\n1991: In the Christmas Mood\n1993: In the Christmas Mood II\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Colony 5 is a Swedish futurepop/synthpop/EBM band founded in March 1999. P–O Svensson started the band as a hobby with Magnus Löfdahl. The music style has changed with group membership and their sound became more consistent. They have toured through Europe – Denmark, Russia, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Poland, Norway, Estonia as well as the United States, and Mexico.\nOn 14 December 2007 Colony 5 released the first single from their then-upcoming full-length album, Buried Again. The \"Knives\" MCD showed off a harder sound as a first taste of what the album would sound like. Buried Again was released in February 2008 on Memento Materia for Scandinavia, Infacted for Germany and ArtOfFact in the USA.\n\n\n== Members ==\nP-O Svensson (1999–present)\nMagnus Löfdahl (1999–2001)\nJohan Nilsson (2001–2003)\nMagnus Kalnins (2002–present)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== EPs and singles ===\n\"Colony 5\" (2002)\n\"Follow Your Heart\" (2002)\n\"Black\" (2003)\n\"Fate\" (2004)\n\"Plastic World\" (2005)\n\"Knives\" (2007)\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nLifeline (2002)\nStructures (2003)\nColonisation (2004)\nFixed (2005)\nBuried Again (2008)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nColony 5 discography at MusicBrainz\nColony 5 discography at Discogs"

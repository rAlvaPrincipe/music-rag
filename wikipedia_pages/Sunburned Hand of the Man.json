    "text": "Sunburned Hand of the Man are an experimental rock band from Boston, Massachusetts. They are a loose collective known for their frequent line up changes and large discography released on a variety of labels including Eclipse Records, Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace!, Three Lobed Recordings, and their own Manhand label.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSunburned Hand of the Man formed in Boston in 1994, growing out of a trio named Shit Spangled Banner with John Moloney and Robert Thomas managing an ever-changing line-up. Their initial influences included Sonic Youth and the Melvins, though as their line-up expanded they began to incorporate elements of folk, drone, free jazz, and funk.\nBy the early 2000s the band were increasingly associated with the \"free folk\" movement as described by David Keenan in his article \"New Weird America\" for The Wire. The following decade saw a consistent stream of limited edition releases and live documents, ranging from improvised noise to more coherently arranged material such as 2007's Four Tet-produced Fire Escape and 2010's A.\nTheir output slowed during the 2010s and releases became more infrequent, although the band never fully deactivated.\nFrequent Sunburned guitarist Marc Orleans died on June 25, 2020, at the age of 52. The following year the band returned with Pick a Day to Die, an album edited together from unreleased material recorded between 2007 and 2017.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\n1994 Shit Spangled Banner (self-released cassette, Ecstatic Yod Ass Run LP)\n1997 Mind Of A Brother (Manhand 001, CD)\n1998 Piff's Clicks (Manhand 002, CD)\n2001 Jaybird (Manhand 003, CD)\n2001 Wild Animal (Manhand 004, CD)\n2001 The Healers Barrel (Manhand 005, CD)\n2002 The Book of Pressure (Manhand 006, CD)\n2002 The Agoraphobic Christcycle (Manhand 007, CD)\n2002 Headdress (Records, LP)\n2002 Jaybird (Qbico, LP)\n2002 Sopra L'Influsso - video - (Qbico)\n2003 Shit Spangled Banner-Inflated with Self-Hatred (Manhand 008, CD)\n2003 Closer to the Bone (Manhand 009/010, CD)\n2003 Magnetic Drugs (Manhand 011, CD)\n2003 The Trickle Down Theory of God Knows What (Eclipse, LP, CD)\n2003 The Sunburned Hand of the Man (LP)\n2003 Hoof Trip (Riot Season, 7\")\n2004 Soft (Manhand 012)\n2004 Rare Wood (Spirit of Orr, CD)\n2004 The Secret in Disguise (Finga 013, CD)\n2004 No Magic Man (Bastet, CD)\n2005 Zample (Manhand 014, CD)\n2005 Anatomy (Manhand 024, CD)\n2005 Wedlock (Eclipse, double LP)\n2005 Complexion (Records, LP)\n2006 The Mylar Tantrum (Three Lobed Recordings, CD)\n2006 Bone For Sky Baba Ganoush (Chad Cooper CD)\n2007 Z (Ecstatic Peace, CD)\n2007 The Blaze Game (Conspiracy Records) - collaboration with Circle as Sunburned Circle\n2007 Fire Escape (Smalltown Supersound) - produced by Four Tet\n2007 \"Weekend at Burnie's 2\" (Lost Treasures of the Underworld, LP)\n2007 \"Locked / Loaded\" Cs (Meudiademorte, Cassette]\n2008 the Spacial Crime symbol (Manhand 082, CD)\n2009 Loose Bugs (Magnetic Expansion Label, CD)\n2010 A (Ecstatic Peace!, LP) - produced by Four Tet\n2019 Headless (Sunburned Records 165, CD)\n2020 Covered In Mud (Manhand 170, CD)\n2021 Pick a Day To Die (Three Lobed Recordings)\n2021 Vulgarisms (Manhand 178, CD)\n2021 Exile on Broadway (Manhand 172, CD)\n2021 The Air Itself (Manhand 182, CD)\n2022 Headdress 20th Anniversary Remaster  (Three Lobed Recordings 141, LP)\n2024 Nimbus (Three Lobed Recordings 150, LP)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site\nSunburned Hand of the Man at AllMusic\n77 Boadrum Site Profile Viva Radio, Sep 2007.

    "text": "Gat Decor (or Gat DÃ©cor) were an English electronic music group popular with the 1992 song \"Passion\". The song is considered to be one of the best-known works of the early progressive house genre.\nThe main contributors of the team are the British DJs and producers, Simon Slater, Laurence Nelson-Boudville and Simon Hanson. The name 'Gat Decor' was derived from an anagram of 'Tag Records', a record store based in Soho, London.\nAlthough Gat Decor does not have an extensive catalog (two proper singles and a handful of remixes), the act and \"Passion\" are widely considered influential to electronic dance music in the early 1990s; and Slater still continues to license \"Passion\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1992 \"Passion\" (#29 UK)\n1996 \"Passion\" (remix) (#6 UK)\n1996 \"In the Head\" / \"Barefoot in the Head\"\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n1992 Euphoria \"Love You Right\"\n1992 The Odd Company \"Swing in Trance\"\n1992 D'lusion \"Take You There\"\n1993 Latitude \"Building a Bridge\"\n1993 JFK \"Here They Come Again\"\n1993 Country & Western \"Positive Energy\"\n1994 Jean-Michel Jarre \"Chronologie Part 6\"\n1994 The Good Strawberries \"Eyes on a Summer Day\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPhunky Phantom\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nOfficial Myspace"

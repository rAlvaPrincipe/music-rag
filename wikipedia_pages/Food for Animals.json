    "text": "Food for Animals were an American hip hop group formed in 2001 near Washington, D.C. The group featured Vulture Voltaire (Andrew Field-Pickering), Ricky Rabbit (Nick Rivetti), Dr. Dan (Daniel Helmer), and HY (Sterling Warren). Their music was generally categorized as underground hip hop with a strong tendency towards noise music. According to Pitchfork, their latest albums feature a sound best appreciated by \"those with a high tolerance for serial grime and a taste for the sharper, harder edge of hip-hop\".\n\n\n== History ==\nField Pickering, a Washington, D.C.

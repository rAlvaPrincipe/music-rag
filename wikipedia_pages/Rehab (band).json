    "text": "Rehab is an American hip hop group from Warner Robins, Georgia. The band recorded seven albums, initially as the duo of Danny \"Boone\" Alexander and Jason \"Brooks\" Buford, before Buford left the group and Alexander continued with the band as a quintet.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1998–1999: Formation and debut ===\nRehab was originally formed by vocalists Danny \"Boone\" Alexander and Jason \"Brooks\" Buford, with producer Denny \"Steaknife\" Campbell.\nBoone and Campbell (both from Warner Robins, Georgia) were previously the rap group \"Prime Suspect\". Alexander and Buford were recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, and while it is a common misconception they met at a rehab facility, the trio did not meet within rehabilitation. Early on, they released their first album To Whom It May Consume produced by Campbell and Buford.\n\n\n=== 2000–2002: Departure of Steaknife, and Southern Discomfort ===\nSoon after To Whom It May Consume, Campbell was incarcerated and Epic/Sony offered a record deal to Buford and Alexander as a duo. Mashing rap with rock, the duo released their major label debut album, Southern Discomfort, in 2000 on the Sony label. Cee-Lo & Bigg Gipp of Goodie Mob, Mandy Lauderdale and Cody ChesnuTT were the guests on the album, which spawned the Top 15 modern rock hit \"It Don't Matter\", and \"Sittin' At A Bar\".\nTwo years were spent on the road supporting the album touring with Kottonmouth Kings and the Phunk Junkeez, including a stint on the Warped Tour.\n\n\n=== 2002–2004: Cuz We Can, departure of Buford, and hiatus ===\nFor reasons not publicly clarified, Buford left the band, and released 26 unreleased Rehab songs on his website towards the end of his tenure. This collection was later known to fans as Cuz We Can. 22 of the 26 songs were produced by Denny \"Steaknife\" Campbell, and the album was later given out to on tours by Boone in 2007. Boone also modified the track list of the pressed version, removing certain songs and adding new ones, in light of Buford's departure.\nAfter two years on the road supporting the Vans Warped Tour and playing with bands such as Linkin Park, the group went on an indefinite hiatus. Buford did not return to the group, however, later appeared as host of 2005's Trailer Fabulous on MTV and recorded a single for the show's theme, before joining the short-lived project The Audio Club with Tommy Hendriksen.\n\n\n=== 2004–2010: Reformation, Graffiti the World, and Welcome Home ===\n\nIn 2004, Boone connected with Atlanta producer Shannon Houchins. WIth Houchins, a new band was assembled consisting of guitarist Mike Hartnett, Hano Leathers, Chris Hood and Foz. Now a quintet with Alexander, Rehab signed with Arshid Entertainment and released Graffiti the World in 2005.\nSometime in 2008, the three original members decided to do a reunion EP and go by the name Southern Discomfort. Their label saw this and decided to halt most of the promotion, since the name of Southern Discomfort was essentially owned by Epic/Sony. As a result, the label released Sitting at a Bar, which was a re-release of their debut album. All of this was done without the band's permission.\nTo fight this unauthorized reissue, the band re-recorded the single and renamed it \"Bartender Song.\" This version would end up on a 2008 version of Graffiti the World released by the major label, Universal. Rehab stuck with Universal for their 2010 album Welcome Home, which saw a handful of singles on the Top 30 video countdown for CMT through January 2011.\n\n\n=== 2011–2014: Gullible's Travels and breakup ===\nGullible's Travels was released on February 21, 2012 through AVJ Records (a subsidiary label of Average Joe's Entertainment) owned by former Rehab producer and manager Shannon Houchins and country music artist Colt Ford. Touring followed with the single \"Waho by the Hoti\" (\"the Waffle House by the hotel\"). The video for their single \"King of Tweakers\", which was released on their website in the summer of 2011, premiered on February 21, 2012 with the album release. A video for the next single \"Can't Catch Up To You\" was also recorded.\nOn July 3, 2013, a track by Twiztid was released off their first mixtape A New Nightmare entitled \"Unjust love\", featuring Danny Alexander.\nThe band released a 2013 single \"Whore\" which would be the last recorded content by the band. In 2014, the band released a statement to their fans that they would be going on a farewell tour and disband to form solo careers. Before the break, the band recorded a full album titled Million Dollar Mugshot, which Average Joes Entertainment did not release until 2017.\n\n\n=== 2015–2016: Possible reformation ===\nSometime in June 2015, former founding member Denny Campbell posted on his Facebook page that said there was a possible Rehab reunion between Alexander and himself. He continued to post pictures of him and Boone in the studio as well. On March 19, 2016, a possible album cover was posted on Rehab's website. On September 1, 2017, Million Dollar Mug Shot was finally released.\n\n\n=== 2017–present: Reformation ===\nOn December 31, 2017, Alexander announced via video on the official Rehab Facebook page that Rehab had returned. In the video, he stated there would be new music and tour in 2018. He also stated that the band lineup is now Danny Boone and Jericho, in addition to a full band.\nOn April 12, 2019, the studio album titled Galaga was released. This is the first album released independently with the help of ONErpm. Full tours in 2019 and 2020 followed. The tour included a band but with a different lineup as prior iteration as seen below.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\nCurrent lineup\n\nDanny \"Boone\" Alexander (vocals)\nDoyle Williams (lead guitar)\nNate Lee (bass)\nIan Corabi (drums)\n\nFormer members\n\nJason Brooks 'Buford' (vocals)\nLamar Williams Jr. (vocals)\nHano Leathers (bass)\nFazal \"Foz\" Syed (guitar)\nMike Hartnett (guitar)\nDemun Jones (vocals)\nDJ Chris Crisis (turntables)\nChris Hood (drums)\nDoyle Williams (guitar)\nJericho Stone (vocals)\nCaleb Melvin (Drummer)\nTaylor Robins (guitar)\nDenny Campbell (Steaknife) (vocals)\nBrandon Dover (bass)\nDJ Uh Oh (turntables)\nJoey Malik (guitar)\n\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n==== Studio albums ====\n\n\n==== Live albums ====\n\n\n==== Mix albums ====\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRehabmusic.com – official website\nRehab Lyrics"

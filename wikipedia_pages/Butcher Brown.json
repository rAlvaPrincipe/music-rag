    "text": "Butcher Brown is a jazz quintet founded in 2009 and based in Richmond, Virginia. Their members are Marcus Tenney (trumpet and saxophone), Morgan Burrs (guitar), Corey Fonville (percussion), Andrew Randazzo (bass), and DJ Harrison (keyboards).\nDownBeat has characterized them as a \"'70s jazz-funk fusion throwback\". Others describe their music as a mix of jazz, hip-hop, soul, funk, and R&B. National Public Radio says that \"they scoff at the limitations of adjacent genres with the expertise of master musicians who've played together so long that they flow from one vibe to the next without missing a beat.\"\nBurrs and Fonville, speaking about the band's sound and development, have cited the following as inspirations: D'Angelo, the Headhunters, the Miles Davis Second Quintet, Return to Forever, the Robert Glasper Experiment, the Roots, Spyro Gyra, and Weather Report.\nButcher Brown's cover of Little Richard's \"Rip It Up\" was selected as the theme song of Monday Night Football in September 2020.\nIn 2024, the band won the third annual Newlin Music Prize for their album Solar Music.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThey have released nine albums.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site"

He combines a modernist vocabulary with flourishes of the romantic, with little trace of the avant-garde; old-fashioned ears will drink this music in. Still it's unpredictable enough to delight those who yearn for something new and original... the magical music stands strongly on its own.\" This quote is excerpted from a Seattle Post-Intelligencer review of Bunch's music for The Snow Queen, a full-length ballet released as a two-CD set from Innova Recordings featuring Brian McWhorter conducting Orchestra Next.\nFollowing the Marin Symphony's performance of Bunch's Piano Concerto featuring soloist Monica Ohuchi, San Francisco Classical Voice wrote, \"highly enjoyable music…merging classical and pop music elements into an attractive, relatively unchallenging mix that's in tune with the current eclectic plateau of musical fashion.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Juilliard School people\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site"

    "text": "Sugarbomb was a power pop band from Fort Worth, Texas.  After an independent release, Tastes Like Sugar, in 1999, they signed to RCA and released their second album, Bully, in 2001. However, RCA dropped them two weeks after the release. The single \"Hello\" reached number 34 on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart.  Billboard writer Geoff Mayfield included Bully on his top ten albums list for 2001, writing in a brief summary that the band's name and album art were \"silly... But, my, does it rock.\"  \nThe song \"Hello\" was included in the films Orange County and Van Wilder (both released in 2002).\nJason Damas at PopMatters wrote of Sugarbomb, \"a damn good sound that rocks hard and is catchy as all hell\", comparing them to the Beach Boys, Todd Rundgren, XTC, and Queen.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nLes Farrington – keyboards, lead vocals\nDaniel Harville – guitar, lead vocals\nMichael Harville – drums, vocals\nGreg Bagby – guitar, vocals\nKelly Riley – bass\n\n\n== Albums ==\nTastes Like Sugar (1999)\nBully (2001)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSugarbomb at AllMusic"

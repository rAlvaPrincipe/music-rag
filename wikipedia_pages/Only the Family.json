    "text": "Only the Family, often abbreviated as OTF, is an American hip hop group from Chicago, Illinois. The group was formed by American rapper Lil Durk in 2010. The group is composed of Chicago-drill recording artists, which included late rapper King Von.\n\n\n== Record label ==\nThe OTF label was part of French Montana's Coke Boys, and as a result, adopted the nickname 'OTF Coke Boys'. This saw OTF members feature on the subsequent Coke Boys album. The label has since grown to be independent from the Coke Boys imprint and is now cooperating with Empire Distribution, except for Lil Durk, who signed to Alamo Records and Interscope Records in 2018 (after being released from his Def Jam Recordings Contract); his releases for Alamo are now distributed by Sony Music after the latter acquired the label in June 2021.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Other charted and certified songs ===\n\n\n== References =="

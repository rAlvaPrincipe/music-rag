    "text": "Nick Buzz is a Canadian band composed of pianist Jon Goldsmith, violinist Hugh Marsh, guitarist Rob Piltch, and singer/songwriter Martin Tielli.\n\n\n== History ==\nGoldsmith, Marsh, Piltch and Tielli came together in 1992 to collaborate on a cover of Joni Mitchell's \"River\" for the 1992 Mitchell tribute album Back to the Garden. The four began practising and performing under the name Nick Buzz, a nod to Tielli's chain-smoking habit ('nicotine buzz').\nNick Buzz released a full-length album, Circo, in 1996 through Dark Light Music. It was rereleased in 2002 by Six Shooter Records, with the music magazine Chart calling it a \"virtually unheard-of 1996 classic\". In 2003, they got back together to perform four songs by Arnold Schoenberg, originally for Andrew Burashko's Art of Time series in Toronto. The group released a recording of these songs for Tielli's Tielli 2003 subscription series on Six Shooter.\nIn 2013 Nick Buzz released the album A Quiet Evening at Home on Six Shooter Records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nCirco (1996)\nArnold Schoenberg and the Berlin Cabaret (2003)\nA Quiet Evening at Home (2013)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRusty Spell's USA Nick Buzz Page"

    "text": "The Detroit News Orchestra was the world's first radio orchestra, first broadcasting in 1922. It was composed of already-distinguished members of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, broadcasting from radio station WWJ in Detroit, Michigan. The orchestra's broadcasts could be received half way across North America and even as far away as Hawaii.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe 16 members of the Detroit News Orchestra were drawn from the city's Detroit Symphony Orchestra, having previously achieved distinction as accomplished soloists. The orchestra broadcast on radio station WWJ, debuting on May 28, 1922. The broadcasts were sponsored by The Detroit Bank and could be received across half of North America.\nThe Orchestra, sometimes referred to as the \"little symphony\" by WWJ Detroit News radio station, played at their studio Monday through Friday at 7:00 P.M., as well as at 2:00 P.M. on Sundays.\n\n\n== Listeners in Hawaii ==\nOn November 23, 1922, at thirty minutes past midnight, the Detroit News Orchestra played the waltz \"Three O'Clock in the Morning\" in studio in the Detroit News building. The transmission was received clearly at 6:30 P.M. local time in the Hawaiian Islands by A. F. Costa, the postmaster there. Several people listened to the program in its entirety at the Wailuku post office, that was more than 4,400 miles (7,100 km) from Detroit. The notes of the music transmitted from the Detroit News radio station in Michigan took about one fiftieth of a second to arrive in Hawaii.\n\n\n== Ensemble ==\n\nList of personnel of the musical ensemble.\n\n\n== See also ==\n1922 in radio\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nThe Detroit News (1922).

    "text": "Nobody's Angel was an American girl group of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The group consisted of four members Alitzah Navarro, Stacey Harper, Amy Sue Hardy, and Sarah Smith, and later, Jennie Kwan and Tai-Amber Hoo as replacements when Harper and Hardy left the group. The band was put together after they became friends and discovered they had something in common: a shared taste for music, dancing, and acting.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn 1998, the quartet recorded \"Let's Get Together\" for the movie The Parent Trap. A year later, the girls all guest-starred as fictionalized versions of themselves on the episode \"Road Trip\" from the ABC sitcom Boy Meets World, and soon after, in 2000, they released their self-titled album, on the Hollywood Records label. Nobody's Angel featured the hit song, \"If You Wanna Dance\". Later, they released the song \"Pokémon World\" with the boy band Youngstown for the movie Pokémon The Movie 2000.\nThey were featured in the ABC TV movie, Model Behavior, starring Justin Timberlake. Stacey and Amy Sue both left the group in 2001 to pursue careers of their own. They were soon replaced by actress-singer Jennie Kwan (formerly of the NBC show California Dreams) and Tai-Amber Hoo. Tai-Amber was a former member of another girl group called Gyrl before she joined Nobody's Angel. However, the group disbanded after the debut single was released.\nAfter recording a few songs for the soundtracks to the Disney live-action films 102 Dalmatians (2000) and The Princess Diaries (2001), the group split up. An album was due to be released in 2002 but was shelved. The album did feature the singles \"Whatcha Gonna Do (With Your Second Chance)?\", \"Always Tomorrow\", and a remake of the Salt-N-Pepa song \"Ain't Nuthin' But a She Thing\" featuring Lil' J. Besides the songs from the soundtracks, No new music from their second album has been leaked.\nIn 2020, Sarah Christine Smith appeared as a guest on the Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip marathon fundraiser episode of The George Lucas Talk Show.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nNobody's Angel (February 1, 2000)\nSingles\n\"If You Wanna Dance\" (November 23, 1999)\n\"I Can't Help Myself\" (2000) (Promo)\nSoundtracks\nThe Parent Trap Soundtrack – \"Let's Get Together\" (July 21, 1998)\nPokémon The Movie 2000 Soundtrack – \"Pokémon World\" featuring Youngstown (July 18, 2000)\n102 Dalmatians Soundtrack – \"Whatcha Gonna Do (With Your Second Chance)?\" (October 30, 2000)\nThe Princess Diaries Soundtrack – \"Ain't Nuthin' But a She Thing\" featuring Lil' J and \"Always Tomorrow\" (July 24, 2001)\nUnited States Of Avex Artists - \"Movin' On\" (2001)\n\n\n=== Unreleased second album ===\nBoyfriend In A Box (3:39)\nCome With Me (Remix) (3:45)\nTell That To My Heart (3:55)\nOut Of My Life (3:27)\nTaboo (3:07)\nConnected (3:31)\nFound Somebody (4:28)\nLive My Life (3:32)\nI'd Like To Be (4:07)\nI'd Never Do That (3:10)\nShy Girl (3:44)\nGet It Right This Time (2:53)\nFight For Your Right To Party (2:59)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNobody's Angel Official on Instagram\nNobody's Angel on Discogs\nNobody's Angel on allmusic\nAlitzah Navarro on IMDb\nStacey Harper on IMDb"

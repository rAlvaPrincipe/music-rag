    "text": "Doubting Thomas was an industrial band formed by two members of Skinny Puppy: cEvin Key and the late Dwayne Goettel. Although considered a Skinny Puppy side project, nearly all the group's music is instrumental. The band shares its name with an American roots band, to whom they have no relation.\n\n\n== History ==\nKey and Goettel began recording together as Doubting Thomas in 1987, but it was not until the duo had some extra time and label interest from Wax Trax! in 1989 that they were able to begin recording a formal album. In contrast to their material as Skinny Puppy and related side projects, Doubting Thomas was explicitly non-vocal, less structured, and \"wandering\" in form – Key characterized it as \"'cryer music,' like music in a movie.\"\nAs Doubting Thomas they released an album and an EP in 1991. The duo continued to record occasionally until 1994; Goettel died in 1995.\nThe album, The infidel, and the EP Father Don't Cry were re-released as a two disc set, first as a limited edition in 2007, and again in 2013.  Father Don't Cry was extended with additional material recorded between 1987 and 1994.\nSeveral other Doubting Thomas songs were included in compilations.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1991 album The Infidel: composed 1987–1990.

    "text": "The Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble (PEE) is an orchestra from North Korea (DPRK). It is famous for its performances of revolutionary and folk songs, as well as some covers of pop songs in the west, including \"Brother Louie\" by Modern Talking and \"One Way Ticket\". They have been reported to be one of the country's most popular groups.\nThe group takes its name from the Battle of Pochonbo on 4 June 1937, when a guerrilla unit under the leadership of Kim Il-sung attacked compounds of the Japanese occupation force in Pochonbo. The group was formed on June 4, 1985, from the electronic music section of the Mansudae Art Troupe. The group was the first electronic pop group in the country.\nIn 1991, the ensemble traveled to Japan to perform as part of a cultural exchange between North Korea and Japan.\nThe Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble can be heard on North Korean radio stations. A total of 182 volumes (186 CDs) were released (due to re-release of volumes 13–16 in the 1990s).\n\n\n== Known members ==\n\nHyon Song-wol – vocals (Merited Actress)\nRi Kyong-suk – vocals (Merited Actress)\nKim Kwang-suk (1964–2018) – vocals (People's Actress)\nRi Pun-hui – vocals (Merited Actress)\nJo Gum-hwa – vocals (Merited Actress)\nChon Hye-yong – vocals (People's Actress)\nKim Jong-nyo – vocals\nYun Hye-young – vocals\nKim Won-il (Edited out from concerts re-released around 2009, and not mentioned as a member since then) – synthesizers (People's Actor)\nKim Hae-song – synthesizers (Merited Actor)\nKim Mun-hyok – synthesizers (Merited Actor)\nKwon Kyong-hak – synthesizers\nKim Song-ryop – synthesizers\nJon Kwon – piano (People's Artist)\nJang Jong-won – piano\nRi Mun – electronic organ\nKang Chol-ho – electronic organ (Merited Actor)\nKang Gum-chol – electronic organ\nPark Ui-hyon – guitar\nSong Kwang – guitar (Merited Actor)\nChoe Yong-chol – guitar (Merited Actor)\nKim Yong-il – bass guitar\nChoe Mun-chol – drums (Merited Actor)\nKim Jin (missing from footage filmed 2015, status as a member is unknown) – percussion (Merited Actor)\nKim Yeon-su – conductor (Merited Artist)\nRi Jong-o (1943–2016) – conductor, major composer (People's Artist, Labour Hero, Order of Kim Il Sung and Kim Il Sung Prize Winner)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of North Korean musicians\nMusic of North Korea\nTraditional music of Korea\nUnhasu Orchestra\nWangjaesan Light Music Band\n\n\n== References =="

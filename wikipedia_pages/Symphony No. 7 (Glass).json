The first movement, \"The Corn,\" focuses on the interplay between Mother Nature and those she provides for.  \"The Hikuri (the Sacred Root)\" is not a root (it is a cactus) that grows in the northern and central Mexican deserts and is thought to be a gateway to the spiritual world, hikuri.  Finally, the last movement is about \"the holder of the Book of Knowledge,\" whom every truth-seeking person must face.\nGlass has integrated three transcendental concepts of ancestral culture (Huichol) : The first is the \" corn \" which means, desire to return to the innocence before adulthood (the connection with Mother Earth); the second, the hikuri is the sacred vision of corn and Blue Deer, and this represents the third symbolism, from this world to the hereafter can do it, because when get the blue deer, stop being ordinary, and the man will be transformed.\n\n\n== External links ==\nKennedy Center description of debut concert\nKennedy Center program notes including notes by Philip Glass"

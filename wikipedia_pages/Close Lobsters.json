    "text": "Close Lobsters are a Scottish indie pop rock band.\n\n\n== History ==\nClose Lobsters first came to wider prominence with the track \"Firestation Towers\" on the NME's C86 compilation. They signed to Fire Records and released their debut single \"Going To Heaven To See If It Rains\" in October 1986.  They released a second single \"Never Seen Before\" in April 1987 which strengthened their reputation as one of the leading emerging indie bands.  They went on to release two albums: Foxheads Stalk This Land was released in 1987 and Headache Rhetoric in 1989.  Rolling Stone's review of \"Foxheads Stalk This Land\" called it \"first-rate guitar pop from a top-shelf band. Close Lobsters could have been just another jangle group, but they have a lot more going for them than just chiming Rickenbackers.\"\nTheir popularity on United States college radio stations led to an invitation to the New York Music Seminar in 1989, which in turn led to an extensive American tour. They toured extensively in the UK, Germany, United States and Canada. The band eventually took an extended break.\nTheir 'best of' singles compilation album, Forever, Until Victory!, (the title is from the reputed last sign-off in a letter from Ernesto 'Che' Guevara to Fidel Castro; 'Hasta la victoria siempre!') was released on 5 October 2009 on Fire Records.\nClose Lobsters's song \"Let's Make Some Plans\" was covered by the Wedding Present on the B-side of their \"California\" single in 1992.\nIn March 2012, Close Lobsters reformed to play the second Madrid Popfest, Glasgow, third Popfest Berlin and the 2013 NYC Popfest.\nIn May 2014, Close Lobsters played the Copenhagen Popfest and released new EP, \"Kunstwerk in Spacetime\". Lead single \"Now Time\" received significant attention, and the band hinted at more new music to come in an interview with Sound.wav Music in July 2014.\nClose Lobsters's song \"Let's Make Some Plans\" was covered by The Luxembourg Signal on the B-side of their \"Laura Palmer\" single in 2017.\nIn February 2020, the band released their latest album, Post Neo Anti: Arte Povera in the Forest of Symbols.  It is their first new studio recording for over 30 years, and AllMusic noted \"From the first strains of album opener \"All Compasses Go Wild,\" it's uncanny how seamlessly the Lobsters pick up right where they left off\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\nChart placings shown are from the UK Indie Chart.\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nFoxheads Stalk This Land (1987, Fire) (No. 12)\nHeadache Rhetoric (1989, Fire) (No. 7)\nForever Until Victory (2009, Fire)\nPost Neo Anti: Arte Povera in the Forest of Symbols (2020, Last Night From Glasgow)\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n\"Going to Heaven to See If It Rains\" (1986, Fire) (No. 9)\n\"Never Seen Before\" (1987, Fire) (No. 11)\n\"Let's Make Some Plans\" (1987, Fire) (No. 17)\n\"What Is There to Smile About?\" (1988, Fire) (No. 17)\n\"Evening Show Sessions\" (1988, Night Tracks)\n\"Nature Thing\" (1989, Fire)\n\"Just Too Bloody Stupid\" (1989, Caff)\n\"Steel Love/ Head Above Water\" (2012, Firestation Records)\n\"Kunstwerk in Spacetime\" EP (2014, Shelflife Records)\n\"Desire and Signs\" EP (2016, Shelflife Records)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClose Lobsters interview on Sound.wav Music\nClose Lobsters at Fire Records"

At the end of the season, the five remaining boys would form the boy band and receive a recording contract with Hollywood Records. After a 24-hour voting period the week before, it was announced at the final live show on August 24, 2017, that Tutton, Perez, Ramos, Calderon and Smith were the winning members, thus forming the boy band In Real Life and performing their debut single, \"Eyes Closed\".\nFollowing their formation, In Real Life performed live on various television programs including Total Request Live in November 2017, Good Morning America in December 2017, and on Live with Kelly and Ryan in February 2018.

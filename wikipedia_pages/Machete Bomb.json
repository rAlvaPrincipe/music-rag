    "text": "Machete Bomb is a Brazilian samba-rock band, hailing from Curitiba, Paraná. The group's leader, Otávio \"Madu\" Madureira, plays cavaquinho over a samba and rock and roll sound, creating a mixture influenced by Mundo Livre S/A and with which he intends to \"break prejudices\" and \"show people\" that \"in Brazil, sabam did what rock contributed to abroad, (it's about) contesting, confronting, facing\", with \"protest songs, which speak truths and discuss sensitive topics\". Besides samba-rock, the group's sound also features elements of hip hop.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2013, they released the EP O Samba do Sul.\nIn 2015, they released their first studio album, O Samba do Sul, a three-part effort containing a total of 23 tracks. It featured Duayer, Papo Reto, DJ Ploc, Alvaro Larsen, Hurakán, Cabes MC, Rodrigo Ribeiro, Andó, J. Velloso, Alienação Afrofuturista and Xandão Menezes.\nIn 2017, they released their sophomore studio album, A Saga do Cavaco Profano, featuring Alessandro Ramos (Alienação Afrofuturista), Dow Raiz, Reacción Ekis, Slick the Misfit and MC Bing Man.\nIn 2018, they took part in a Brazilian Nirvana's In Utero tribute album titled A Soulful Tribute to Nirvana's in Utero, performing a cover of \"Dumb\".\nIn 2020, they released their third album, MXT Comvida, featuring several artists such as Fred Zero Quatro (Mundo Livre S/A), Lemoskine, Lobato and Xandão (both from O Rappa), Mateo Piracés-Ugarte (Francisco, el Hombre), Mulamba, Nave, Odair José, TUYO, BNegão, Dedé Paraízo (Demônios da Garoa), Egypcio (Tihuana), Thestrow, Pete Mcee, Pecaos, Alienação Afrofuturista, Rodrigo Samsara, El Efecto, Caio MacBeserra (Project46), DowRaiz, Andó and Janine Mathias.

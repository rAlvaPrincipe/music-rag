    "text": "Lambchop, originally Posterchild, is an American band from Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\n\nInitially formed as a three piece in 1986 with Kurt Wagner, bassist Marc Trivillion and guitarist Jim Watkins with the name Posterchild. They released some low-fi bedroom recordings on cassette such as I’m Fucking Your Daughter. In 1992 they released a split 7” with Crop Circle Hoax which got the attention of entertainment lawyer George Regis, who sued on behalf of the similarly named band Poster Children. After trying a few different names they settled on Lambchop and signed to Merge Records in 1993 releasing their debut single Nine that year. \nNever a band with a \"core\" lineup, Lambchop has consisted of a large and fluid collective of musicians focused around its creative centre, frontman Kurt Wagner.  Lambchop is loosely associated with the alternative country genre. Initially indebted to traditional country, the music has subsequently moved through a range of influences including post-rock, soul and lounge music.\nWhatever the style, the characteristic mood of Lambchop's music is evoked by Wagner's distinctive songwriting: lyrically subtle and ambiguous, the vocals melodic but understated. American Songwriter described Wagner's lyrics as \"witty and deeply insightful.\"  \nThey were the backing band for Vic Chesnutt on his 1998 album The Salesman and Bernadette.\nSinger Kurt Wagner is married to founder of Nashville 90's record store, Lucy's Record Shop and Tennessee Democratic Party leader Mary Mancini.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nSummary of members as credited on studio albums (1994–present)\n\nFormer bass player Marc Trovillion died of a heart attack in October 2013, aged 56.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Releases as Posterchild ===\n\"An Open Fresca\" / \"A Moist Towlette\" (split with Crop Circle Hoax) (1992)\n\n\n=== Cassettes ===\n Secret Secret Sourpuss  (1990)\n Big Tussie  (1992)\n Sorry About The Deformed Heart  (split with Crop Circle Hoax and Spent) (1993)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Nine\" / \"Moody Fucker\" (1993)\n\"My Cliche\" / \"Loretta Lung\" (1994)\n\"Soaky in the Pooper\" (1994)\n\"Your Life As A Sequel\" (1995)\n\"Scared Out Of My Shoes\" (split 5\" vinyl single with Spent) (1995)\n\"The Man Who Loved Beer\" (1996)\n\"Hank\" (1996)\n\"Cigaretiquette\" / \"Mr. Crabby\" (1996)\n\"Whitey\" / \"Playboy, the Shit\" (1997)\n\"Give Me Your Love (Love Song)\" (1998)\n\"Your Fucking Sunny Day\" (1998)\n\"Up with People!\" / \"Miss Prissy\" (2000)\n\"Is a Woman\" (2002)\n\"Something's Going On (And On)\" (2004)\n\"The Hustle\" / \"When You Were Mine\" (2017)\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nTools in the Dryer (2001)\nThe Decline of the Country and Western Civilization (1993-1999) (2006)\nThe Decline of Country and Western Civilization, Part 2: The Woodwind Years (2006)\nBroken Hearts & Dirty Windows: Songs of John Prine (2010)\nTurd Goes Back: Essential Tracks from Secret Secret Sourpuss & Big Tussie (2011)\n\n\n=== Tour only albums ===\nPet Sounds Sucks (Live at The Great American Music Hall, San Francisco) (2002)\nMono (Live in Würselen, Germany) (2003-04)\nNashville Does Dallas (2004)\nBoo Fucking Who?

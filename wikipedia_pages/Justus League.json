    "text": "The Justus League was a hip hop collective from North Carolina founded in 1999. The collective consists of a total of 15 members (8 emcees, 5 producers, 1 DJ, and 1 consultant aka \"Minister of Opinion\".  The emcees are: Cesar Comanche, Chaundon, Phonte, Rapper Big Pooh, Median, L.E.G.A.C.Y., Sean Boog, and Edgar Allen Floe.  The producers are: 9th Wonder, Khrysis, Son of Yorel, Eccentric, and Big Dho.  The DJ is DJ Flash Gordon, and the Consultant/Minister of Opinion is Mike Burvick. Although material isn't released as a collective, each member works actively in the music scene releasing solo albums, running their own record labels, along with other business endeavors.\nAffiliated acts include Skyzoo, Joe Scudda, Nicolay (of Grammy-nominated group The Foreign Exchange), Darien Brockington, among others.\nCesar Comanche and 9th Wonder first met in 1996 and with Big Dho, they founded the collective in 1999 after meeting other artists at NC Central University and NC State University such as Phonte, Edgar Allen Floe, Son of Yorel, and Median.\nLittle Brother's former manager, Big Dho, founded the Hall of Justus music group in 2003, which provides an outlet for the artists in the collective. Releases by the collective have been released under the Hall of Justus name, including the Soldiers of Fortune compilation in 2006.\nThe group signed to a four-album deal on 6 Hole Records, owned by Desi Relaford (of the Kansas City Royals) in 2004.\nThe collective seems to have splintered, as internal conflicts have led to the breakup of groups (for example, Little Brother) and general dissent within the Justus League.  Also individual members have stated that the time of this collective has passed and that they have moved on, according to Chaundon in an online interview.  A fair number of group members are still active, but some seemed to either have left the collective, or are pursuing separate musical endeavors.\nBrooklyn rapper Skyzoo contributed to three tracks on the Hall of Justus album Soldiers of Fortune.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums by Justus League ===\nNC State of Mind (2003) (2 CD set mixtape in collaboration with hiphopsite.com)\nNational Mayhem (2005) 6 Hole (3CD Box set)\nSoldiers of Fortune (2006) ABB\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe LAWN (The Justus League message board) Dead Link"

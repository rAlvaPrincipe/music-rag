    "text": "TRU (an abbreviation of The Real Untouchables) was an American hip hop group from New Orleans, Louisiana, active from 1989 to 2005. Between 1992 and 1997 the band dwindled from a dozen members to just the main three brothers, Master P, C-Murder, and Silkk the Shocker.\nThe group released six albums, incorporating the typical No Limit formula of G-funk rhythms married to hardcore gangsta lyrics.\n\n\n== History ==\nMaster P, his brothers C-Murder and Silk, his wife Sonya C, King George, Fonzo, Calli G, Markest Banks, Daniel Fry, Big Ed, Daria Kelly, Ea-Ski and CMT were credited as The Real Untouchables when Understanding the Criminal Mind was released in 1992. When Who's Da Killer? was released in 1993 only King George, Calli G, Big Ed, and the brothers remained, joined by Milkman to form TRU. Milkman was gone again when True was released in 1995, and only the brothers were left when Tru 2 da Game was released in 1997.\nThe trio released Da Crime Family in 1999. C-Murder, imprisoned for life in 2003 after murdering a teenage fan, was replaced by Halleluyah on The Truth (2005), the group's final release.\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nMaster P (1989–2005)\nC-Murder (incarcerated) (1989–2005)\nSilkk the Shocker (1989–2005)\nBig Ed (deceased) (1992–1995)\nCali-G (1989–1995)\nChilee Powdah (1989–1993)\nKing George  (1989–1995)\nMilk Man (1989–1994)\nHalleluyah (2005)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\n\nUnderstanding the Criminal Mind (1992)\nWho's da Killer?

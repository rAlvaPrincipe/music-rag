    "text": "The Clay People is an American rock band based in Albany, New York. Singer Daniel Neet has been the only constant member throughout the band's history, providing lyrics and a frontman persona. Guitarist Brian McGarvey and drummer Dan Dinsmore joined in '94 and '96 respectively. These three  formed the core unit that would include an ever-changing lineup of musicians, as its style evolved from American coldwave to post-grunge rock and metal.\n\n\n== History ==\nForming in 1989 as \"Clay People\", the band debuted with the 1991 EP Toy Box before signing to Re-Constriction Records and issuing their debut album Firetribe in May 1993. Clay People's second EP The Iron Icon and studio album Stone-Ten Stitches followed in 1995 and 1996 respectively. The group added \"The\" to their name with the release of their 1998 self-titled album, marking a change in direction from their dance club roots to a live rock band with a lineup featuring Neet, Brian McGarvey (guitar), Mike Guzzardi (guitar), D. Patrick Walsh (bass) and Dan Dinsmore (drums). The album was produced by Neil Kernon for Slipdisc Records and was the band's most successful release.  Songs from the record were included in the soundtracks to the films Strangeland, Universal Soldier: The Return, and Marked for Death.\nInternal conflicts caused the band to go on hiatus in the early 2000s as members pursued solo and side projects or launched new bands. A new album from The Clay People, Waking the Dead, was released on May 22, 2007 via Overit Records with a lineup featuring only Neet, Dinsmore and McGarvey from the 1996 band. Along with the new release was a music video for the album's first single, \"Supersonic Overdrive\". Metroland, the local Albany weekly newspaper, featured the band on their front page as \"The Return of The Clay People\", following the album's release and a successful performance at Edgefest, a local radio station music festival. Shortly following the release of Waking the Dead, the band once again become inactive.\nIn June 2012, Neet, McGarvey and Dinsmore revived The Clay People to perform at the Cold Waves festival \"The Jamie Duffy Memorial Concert\" in Chicago in honor of the guitarist from Acumen Nation who killed himself earlier that year. The Clay People began recording again, however, continuing internal conflicts and ongoing problems associated with substance abuse led to more band member lineup changes and an unfinished album as of five years later. The Clay People released a new album, Demon Hero, featuring a revolving door of recording musicians in September 2018. They began to play shows in the northeast and midwest US again citing their \"return\" as a band, when everything was shut down in 2020.\nNew album \"Cult Hypnotica\" is released July 2022.\n\n\n== Members ==\nDaniel Neet – vocals\nBrian McGarvey – guitar\nDan Dinsmore – drums\nJared Weed - guitar\nEric Braymer – bass\n\n\n=== Former members ===\nMike Guzzardi – guitar\nPhil Montelone – bass\nEliot Engelman – bass\nD.

Consisting of KEVI (Kevin Ford / Prince$$ Rosie), Trevor Dahl, and Matthew Russell based in Los Angeles, the group is notable for their 2016 single \"Sex\", which samples the chorus from \"Let's Talk About Sex\" by Salt-N-Pepa, and their 2017 single \"No Promises\", which featured American singer Demi Lovato and peaked within the top 40 of the US, UK and Australia. The track was certified Platinum by the RIAA.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2014–2015: Formation and debut singles ===\nPrior to the 2014 formation of the trio, Trevor and Matt lived together and later wrote and recorded music with Kevin. Their name was inspired by Kevin's brother who told him that he had found the \"cheat code\" to getting anything he wanted in life. \"We really embody the idea that anything is possible. To us, the real 'cheat code' to life is loving what you do and we hope to convey that energy through our music,\" they said in an interview.\nIn 2015, they released their debut single titled \"Visions\", which reached number one on the Hype Machine chart.

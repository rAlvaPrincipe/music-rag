    "text": "Rachel's was an American chamber music group that formed in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1991. Former Rodan guitarist Jason Noble played music individually and referred to himself as Rachel's but then began collaborating with core members violist Christian Frederickson and pianist Rachel Grimes. The group's work was strongly influenced by classical music, particularly inspired by the minimalist music of the late 20th century, and its compositions reflect this. While the trio formed the core part of the band, the group's recordings and performances featured a varying ensemble of musicians, who played a range of string instruments (including viola and cello) in combination with piano, guitars, electric bass guitar, and a drum set that included a large orchestral bass drum. A key influence on the music of Rachel's was the music of the English composer Michael Nyman, whose music the group's work resembles in both instrumentation and compositional style.\nA profile of the band is included in the book Second-Hand Stories: 15 Portraits of Louisville by Michael L. Jones.\nNoble died of cancer on August 4, 2012, and Edward Grimes died on March 25, 2017.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nHandwriting (1995, Quarterstick Records)\nMusic for Egon Schiele (1996, Quarterstick)\nThe Sea and the Bells (1996, Quarterstick)\nSelenography (1999, Quarterstick)\nFull On Night Split disc with Matmos (2000, Quarterstick)\nSignificant Others (2002, Tour-only CD available at ATP)\nSystems/Layers (2003, Quarterstick)\nTechnology Is Killing Music EP (2005, Three Lobed Recordings)\n\n\n== Band members ==\nChristian Frederickson – viola\nEdward Grimes – percussion, vibraphone (deceased)\nRachel Grimes – piano, organ\nGreg King – vibraphone, djembe, film projections\nEve Miller – cello\nJason Noble – guitar, bass (deceased)\n\n\n== Contemporary usage ==\nThe Rachel's song \"Water from the Same Source\" was featured in the movie Hancock, although it did not appear on the official soundtrack, and in the Italian film The Great Beauty.

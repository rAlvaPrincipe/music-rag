    "text": "NCT U (Korean: 엔씨티유; Japanese: エヌシーティー) is the first sub-unit from the South Korean boy band NCT. They debuted on April 9, 2016, with the double digital single \"The 7th Sense\"  and \"Without You\" under the label SM Entertainment. The member line of NCT U is rotational, changing with each release and concept. The group's original members were Taeyong, Ten, Doyoung, Jaehyun, and Mark. NCT U is most known for their experimental nature, with their singles inspired by various genres such as trap and electro pop.\n\n\n== History ==\nNCT U's debut was confirmed in early April 2016 after SM Entertainment CEO Lee Soo-man announced plans in January 2016 to create a boy group with core principles of localization and flexibility in its lineup. The group made their first broadcast appearance on April 9, 2016, in a Naver broadcast with Super Junior's Heechul, where he introduced the initial group lineup of Taeyong, Ten, Doyoung, Jaehyun, and Mark.\nThe group made their Chinese & Korean debut with two digital singles: \"The 7th Sense\" (released April 9, 2016) and \"Without You\" (released April 10, 2016). The singles would peak at #2 and #3 respectively on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales charts on April 30, 2016.\nIn 2018, NCT released NCT 2018 Empathy, featuring two new songs by NCT U: \"Boss\" and \"Baby Don't Stop\". The member lineup for this release consisted of Taeyong, Ten, Doyoung, Jaehyun, Mark, Winwin, Jungwoo, and Lucas. \"Baby Don't Stop\" and \"Boss\" would peak at #2 and 3 respectively on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales charts on March 31, 2018.\nNCT's second studio album NCT 2020 Resonance featured multiple new NCT U songs, including \"Make A Wish\" (also called \"Birthday Song\"), \"From Home\", and \"Work It\". In contrast to the smaller member lineups on the singles of 2016 and 2018, this release featured all 23 members of NCT. NCT U would also receive their first award as a group on episode 375 of Show Champion for \"Make A Wish\".\nOn December 14, 2021, NCT U released the title track for NCT's 2021 album Universe, \"Universe (Let's Play Ball)\". This release's lineup included members Doyoung, Jungwoo, Mark, Xiaojun, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin, Yangyang, and Shotaro.\nUpon the release of NCT's album Golden Age on August 28, 2023, NCT U's \"Baggy Jeans\" hit #1 on Billboard's Hot Trending Songs chart the week of its release. This release marked the first reunion of NCT U's original lineup - Taeyong, Doyoung, Ten, Jaehyun, and Mark - since their 2016 debut. On December 6, 2023, \"Marine Turtle\"  was released with a new member lineup of Renjun, Chenle, Xiaojun, and Kun.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== SM Station singles ===\n\n\n=== Soundtrack appearances ===\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="

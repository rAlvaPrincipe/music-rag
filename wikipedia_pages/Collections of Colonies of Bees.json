Their debut album appeared on the UK-based label Rosewood Union, while their next several releases appeared on Crouton Records. By the time of their 2004 release Customer, they had added two new members, Jon Minor and Jim Schoenecker, and signed with Polyvinyl Records. In 2006, the group added Thomas Wincek and Daniel Spack, though two more years would pass before their next full-length, Birds, appeared. In 2011, the band released the album Giving on the label Hometapes.

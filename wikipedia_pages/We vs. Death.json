    "text": "We vs. Death was a Dutch instrumental post-rock band, founded in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\n \nIn the second half of 2000 a couple of like-minded musicians find each other at Utrecht University in Netherlands and decide to start a band. The band's name was initially Dylman's Disco Method, but after a while was changed to We vs. Death. Almost right away they chose to make instrumental post-rock.\nWe vs. Death played large venues such as Paradiso, 013, Vera and Tivoli as well as small-scale venues and squats like the ACU and the OCCII. Outside The Netherlands, they played venues in Belgium, England, Canada, France, Russia, Poland, Denmark, Germany and Japan.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== 7-inch ===\nTheir first vinyl-single was released in 2001 on the Zabel Muziek music-label. This single contained four songs:\n\nMK Ultra\nHMV\nAwful Exchange\nHeron\n\n\n=== Split-CD with Tom Sweetlove ===\nIn 2003 the band released a split-CD with the Belgian post-rock band Tom Sweetlove. Each band contributed four songs for this release, titled \"The Message Is\", that was released on the Dutch Zabel Muziek-label and the Belgian Matamore-label.\nThe We vs. Death-songs on this CD are:\n\nMy Dog is Watching Me\nCity Council Cosmos\nConsertina\nWave Goodbye With Your Little Hand\n\n\n=== Split-CD with Green Concorde ===\nIn 2004 the band decided upon releasing a split-CD again, this time together with the Danish indie rock band Green Concorde. On this album, released on Zabel Muziek and Eglantine Records, appeared the following We vs. Death songs:\n\nPictures From Stellenbosch\nWorkers Are Referred To As \"Hands\"\nWake 44\n\n\n=== We Too Are Concerned / We Are Too Concerned ===\nAfter releasing the 7-inch EP on two split-CDs, the band released their full-length debut in Spring 2006. The CD-package also contained a DVD and a booklet with a short story from artist Jeremiah Day. The CD, again released on the Zabel Muziek-label contains eight tracks:\n\nAnd How To Translate It\nPictures From Stanford\nSnow Cushioned The Fall\nOne Light Will Do\nThomas Corner And The Valley Houses\n(Yes,) We Went To Novgorod\nMother And Father And Me\nFieldfire\n\n\n=== A Black House, A Coloured Home ===\nIn 2009 the band released their second full-length album. The album marked a slight change in style, and was their first release on Beep! Beep! Back Up The Truck.

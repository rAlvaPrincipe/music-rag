    "text": "Dirtyphonics is a French electronic music band from Paris, consisting of members Charly Barranger and Julien \"PitchIn\" Corrales. Their music style is based on dubstep, drum and bass, and drumstep.\nIn 2008, Dirtyphonics signed on Shimon's label AudioPorn Records and released their debut single, \"French F**k\" which reached number one on Beatport's charts. After releasing remixes on many labels, such as Virgin Records, Atlantic Records, Warner Bros. Records, Sony Records, Mau5trap, Cooking Vinyl, Ram, MTA, Ultra Records, they joined Dim Mak Records in 2012. Dirtyphonics has worked with Linkin Park, Skrillex, Kaskade, Benny Benassi, Foreign Beggars, NERO, Modestep, Steve Aoki, Marilyn Manson, and many more through collaborations and remixes.\nIn March 2013, Dirtyphonics released their debut full-length album Irreverence which merges heavy bass music, drum and bass, dubstep, and electro. The first single from the album, \"Dirty,\" was released in October 2012, followed by \"Walk In The Fire,\" \"No Stopping Us,\" and \"Hanging On Me\" in 2013, with remixes covering most genres of electronic music.\nAfter 2 years of a worldwide tour, the band released their \"Write Your Future\" EP, on which they re-assess their love for melting genres together. The EP was released on 17 February 2015 and followed by the \"Write Your Future – Remixes\" EP in September of the same year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early career ===\nDirtyphonics was founded in 2004 and began performing live shows in 2006. For the first two years, the group consisted of Charly, Thomas Desbouvrie, and Pho. In 2008 PitchIn joined the fold. Their influences include Daft Punk and Pendulum, as well as metal bands such as Metallica and Korn. \"Most of us started by playing in metal bands,\" recalls Charly. \"Our sound was always meant to be powerful, high-impact, and precise. From the day we’ve started, we’ve challenged ourselves to create something new - we love to push boundaries.\" The boys did just that in translating the energy and excitement from their head-banging days to the emergent world of electronic dance music.\nIn 2008, the group signed to Shimon's label, AudioPorn Records. They released their first single that year, the aptly named \"French F**k\" which quickly rose to the number one spot on Beatport's charts and stayed there for several weeks. Follow-up singles \"Quarks\" and \"Vandals\" proved the act's ascension was no fluke, showcasing the group's signature style-shifting low-end heavy sound. The group quickly became a hot commodity in the remix world, lending their talents to tracks by the likes of Skrillex, The Bloody Beetroots, Marilyn Manson, Benny Benassi, Excision, Datsik, Borgore, Nero, and Linkin Park. In 2013, Thomas quit the band to become an artist as \"Matheo de Bruvisso\".\n\n\n=== 2013: Irreverence ===\nIn 2009, they earned \"Best Newcomer Producer\" honor at the Drum & Bass Arena Awards. The next three years were a busy time for Dirtyphonics. They headlined sold-out shows worldwide with everyone from Skrillex and Knife Party to Steve Aoki and DJ Snake. They also made notable appearances at festivals like EDC, Glastonbury Festival, SXSW, Pukkelpop, WMC, Tomorrowland and countless others.\nOn 19 March they released their first full-length album Irreverence on Dim Mak Records. The album is a heavy mix of anthemic electro, frenetic drum-step, thrash guitars, and pounding drums. It features notable collaborations with Steve Aoki, Foreign Beggars, and Modestep.\n\n\n=== 2015: Write Your Future ===\nIn early 2014, Thomas Desbouvrie resigned from the band to pursue his aspirations in Art. Although one member short, the band lost no speed and continued touring at major festivals worldwide. Finding a second wind in the studio, Dirtyphonics released a collaboration with Zeds Dead, Where Are You Now feat. Bright Lights on Mad Decent. In February 2015, the band released their sophomore Write Your Future EP  on Dim Mak Records including collaborations with UZ, 12th Planet, Trinidad James, Matt Rose and Julie Hardy. The band toured the US and Europe while continuing to write much music. Back from tour, the band released Anonymous in homage of their Drum and Bass roots and as a strong statement of their sound. Quickly after, the Write Your Future – Remixes EP came out on Dim Mak Records with remixes from Habstrakt, FuntCase, High Maintenance and Infuze. On 21 October 2015, the band released \"Hoverboard\", a song they wrote in 2005.\n\n\n=== 2017: Vantablack ===\nIn 2017 Dirtyphonics joined Monstercat to release their “Vantablack EP” in collaboration with Sullivan King. This EP re-assesses their metal roots and cements the heaviness and diversity of their sound. Songs like “Hammer”, “Sight Of Your Soul” and “Vantablack’” gathered over 15M streams on Spotify and landed on major playlists.\n\n\n=== 2019 to present: LIIVE ===\nIn 2019 they created and designed a brand new show to celebrate 10 years on the road. With their new “Dirtyphonics LIIVE”, Charly and Pitchin have been headlining festivals all over Europe as an homage to their roots. They have been working intensively on exclusive music and visuals to create a unique experience ready to take you on a very special journey. Through joining the Disciple records family they released the iconic “Scars EP”, “Rise From The Dead”, \"Gasoline\" as well as many collaborations and remixes. \nIn 2020 Dirtyphonics has stepped up their role of ambassador of the French Bass Music by helping and pushing established and up coming French producers to the limelight. There are some very exciting projects and collaborations on the way…\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\nRemixes\nPhaseOne - \"Break Em\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2020\nZeds Dead - \"Blame\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2017\nThe Chainsmokers - \"Closer\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2016\nSkrillex and Alvin Risk - \"Try It Out\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2016\nSteve Aoki - \"Neon Future\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2015\nLe Castle Vania - \"Disintegrate\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2014\nKaskade and Project 46 - \"Last Chance\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2013\nSteve Aoki and Rune RK featuring RAS - \"Bring You To Life\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2013\nLinkin Park - Lies Greed Misery (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2013\nBorgore - Legend (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2013\n12th Planet & Flinch - \"The End Is Near Part 1\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2012\nForeign Beggars - \"Apex\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2012\nMarilyn Manson - \"Slo-Mo-Tion\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2012\nExcision & Datsik - \"Deviance\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2012\nKrewella - \"Killin it\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2012\nKrafty Kuts featuring Dynamite MC - \"Pounding\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2011\nDan Sena featuring Del the Funky Homosapien & Kylee Swenson - \"Song Of Siren\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2011\nThe Crystal Method featuring The Heavy - \"Play For Real\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2011\nSkrillex - \"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2011\nDoes It Offend You, Yeah? - \"Wondering\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2011\nBenny Benassi featuring T-Pain  - \"Electroman\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2011\nNero  - \"Me & You\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2011\nShimon - \"The Shadow Knows\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2010\nThe Bloody Beetroots  - \"Warp\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2010\nShockOne  - \"Polygon\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2010\nAki & Cody-C - \"Reggaetronik\" (Dirtyphonics Remix) - 2006\n\n\n== Awards ==\nBest Newcomer Producers (DNB Arena Awards 2009)\nBest Band Or Duo (DJ Mag FR)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nKnowledge Magazine (September 2008)\nKnowledge Magazine (March 2009)\nATM Magazine (April 2009)\nInternational DJ Magazine (August 2009)\nInterview with Broken Beats (September 2009)\nTRAX Magazine (August 2010)\nBBC 1XTRA Crissy Criss Show (August 2009)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"

    "text": "Voltaj (pronounced [volˈtaʒ]; Romanian for 'voltage') is a Romanian pop rock group. They are widely regarded as one of the most successful bands in Romanian history, with songs such as \"20\", \"De la capăt\" and \"De mâine\" being household hits.\n\n\n== History ==\nVoltaj was formed in 1982, in Bucharest, by: Horațiu Rad on bass, Nikki Dinescu (Krypton) on drums, Gabi Nacu (Krypton) on guitar, Cristi Minculescu (Iris) on vocals and Adrian Ilie (Iris) on guitar. Their sound at the time was on the heavier side of hard rock, being one of the earliest examples of traditional heavy metal in the Romanian scene.\nDuring this period there were numerous changes in the line-up, all the disputes even spawning a second Voltaj, known as Voltaj 88', which also managed to release a couple of albums during the '90s.\nBy the time of their 1996 debut, \"Pericol de Moarte\", only drummer Nikki Dinescu was left from the original line-up. The album, which also features Tavi Colen Talisman on vocals, is their only record in the heavy metal style.\nStarting with 1998 the two remaining members, bass player Vali Ionescu, and guitar player Gabi Constantin recruit a new line-up, with Bobby Stoica on keyboards which brought Călin Goia on vocals on board. With Goia's vocals and creative mind, the group rapidly grew in success and fame. With the release of the album, \"Risc Maxim 2\", the group switches its style to electronic-influenced pop-rock music. In 2002 they were joined by Oliver Sterian (son of Valeriu Sterian) on drums. Releasing numerous hit singles like \"20 ani\", \"Albinuța\", \"De mâine\", \"De la capăt\" and \"Doar pentru ea\", they have become one of the most widely-known groups in Romania.\nThey won the Best Romanian Act award at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2005. After winning Selecția Națională 2015, they represented Romania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 with the song \"De la capăt\", where they progressed out of their semi-final group to place 15th in the Final with 35 points.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCălin Goia (vocals)\nGabi \"Porcus\" Constantin (electric guitar)\nAdrian Cristescu (keyboards)\nValeriu \"Prunus\" Ionescu (bass guitar)\nOliver Sterian (drums)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\"—\" denotes a single that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial site\nInterview Bobby Stoica (keyboardist Voltaj)\nInterview Calin Goia (singer Voltaj)"

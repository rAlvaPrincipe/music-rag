    "text": "K3 is a Belgian-Dutch girl group with a Dutch-language pop repertoire, consisting of Hanne Verbruggen, Marthe De Pillecyn, and Julia Boschman. In addition to music, they are also central to many cinema films, television series and musicals. The signature style and iconicity of K3 rely on all three girls mostly wearing the same outfit, and they are traditionally a redhead, a brunette, and a blonde. Throughout its career, K3 has built a space within Dutch and Belgian pop culture, becoming one of the most successful groups of the Benelux. The group's name is derived from the first letters of the three first members from 1998: Karen Damen, Kristel Verbeke, and Kathleen Aerts.\nKathleen Aerts stepped out of the formation in March 2009. She was replaced by Josje Huisman later that year after winning audition reality show K2 Zoekt K3. On 6 November 2015 Karen, Kristel and Josje were succeeded by Hanne Verbruggen, Klaasje Meijer and Marthe De Pillecyn after they became the winners of K3 Zoekt K3. On 9 February 2021 Klaasje announced her departure from K3 and another audition reality show was held in the same year to find a new member. Of more than 22,000 participants, Julia Boschman won the contest and became part of the group.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Rise to fame (1998-2002) ===\nThe band was started by Niels William in 1997. It was first called Mascara and consisted of Karen Damen, Kristel Verbeke and Kelly Cobbaut. Their intention was to form a kind of Flemish version of the \"Spice Girls.\" After they had covered a song, Kelly left the group to go to college. She was supposed to be replaced by Deborah Ostrega, but she immediately withdrew after she signed the contract, because she didn't want to sing in Dutch. Ultimately, William managed to find Kathleen Aerts as a replacement and because again someone joined with a 'K' as the initial letter, they decided to change the name of the band to K3 on 13 November 1998. The first single was \"Wat ik wil\" (What I want). This release was not very successful.\nIn 1999, K3 participated in the selection for the Belgian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest with their song \"Heyah Mama\". The song was not well received by one of the judges, who called the girls \"assorted meat products\". Notwithstanding, \"Heyah Mama\" was released as a single and became the first big hit for the band, peaking at the number two spot of the Flemish Ultratop 50 chart, charting 25 weeks. Its popularity grew rapidly. About a year after becoming famous in Flanders, K3 also became famous in the Netherlands.\nK3 is noted for being the first pop act to break through to the top of the charts without receiving any airplay from the regular music television channels. Their songwriters became Miguel Wiels, Alain Vande Putte and Peter Gillis.\n\n\n=== Joining Studio 100 (2002-2009) ===\n\nIn 2002, Niels William sold the band to Studio 100, a Flemish television production company for Dutch and Belgian programs, movies and musicals.\nK3 provided many hits, they had released nine albums. Their eighth album Ya Ya Yippee sold more than 50,000 copies in pre-sales within the Benelux. The ninth album, Kusjes (Kisses), sold 20,000. They also released several DVD's with video clips, musicals, films and with specially recorded footage. K3 has a children's television program called De wereld van K3 (K3's World).\nIn 2006, a party was held at Plopsaland, a popular theme park, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Studio 100. At the event, the band members opened the K3 Museum which provides an overview of their career. There are interviews, clothes, and props from the films to be seen, including the air scooters from the film K3 en het Magische Medaillon (K3 and the magic medallion). Their gold and platinum certifications can also be seen.\n\nIn 2007, a team from Madame Tussauds in London took measurements of the band members for wax statues. K3 unveiled these at Madame Tussauds Amsterdam the same year. In 2008, the band celebrated their 10-year anniversary with the show 10 jaar K3 (10 years of K3). It was also celebrated in Plopsaland.\n\n\n=== Line-up change (2009) ===\nOn 23 March 2009 Kathleen announced her departure at a press conference. \"It was a tough decision, after all, I gave the best years of my life to K3. People change and life is constantly in motion; I'm 30 now and after ten years it's time to move on\". She made her last two appearances with K3 in June at a Studio 100 showcase at the Rotterdam Ahoy. \nKaren and Kristel then searched for a replacement on television through a talent show called 'K2 zoekt K3' ('K2 searching for K3'). In the final episode, the Dutch Josje Huisman was chosen as the newest member of K3.\n\n\n=== Further success (2010-2014) ===\n\nThe first single with Huisman as part of the group, \"MaMaSÃ©!\", became a smash hit, peaking at number one for six consecutive weeks in The Netherlands and for seven weeks in Belgium. It listed in the top three of both countries' year-end charts. The album of the same name entered the year-end album chart in both countries in 2009, 2010 and 2011.  \nIn 2010, K3 shot new episodes for their kids-talkshow (this time with Josje) and also started their own sitcom called \"Hello K3\", in which they portray fictional versions of themselves living in the same building and trying to balance a normal life with being superstars. A new single with the same name was also released on the album Eyo!.\n\nIn 2011 they starred in the first 3D-musical in the world, based in Lewis Carrol's Alice in Wonderland. In 2012 they released their album Engeltjes (little angels) accompanied by their fourth movie K3 Bengeltjes. In 2013, they released their album Loko Le and their fifth movie K3 Dierenhotel (K3 Animalhotel). \nIn 2014 they also started a new unscripted TV-show, 'K3 kan het!' (K3 can do it!'), in which they travel through Belgium and the Netherlands to help children fulfill their dreams.\n\n\n=== The new K3 (2015-2021) ===\nOn 18 March 2015 Damen, Verbeke and Huisman announced through a press conference that they were all leaving the group stating \"since we started, we knew there would be a time which we would feel that it was the accurate moment to stop; well, that moment is now present\". K3's label has announced that they'll look for new members in late 2015. A second audition television show, K3 Zoekt K3, premiered in autumn to find the new K3 members. On 6 November 2015 Hanne Verbruggen, Klaasje Meijer and Marthe De Pillecyn had been chosen as Karen, Kristel and Josje's successors (respectively) and would become the new K3. They were chosen from 6,081 girls.\nKristel Verbeke was their manager for the first 2 years.\n\nFrom autumn 2015, the old K3 and the new K3 went on tour together. For Karen, Kristel and Josje this was a farewell tour, for the new trio it was the start of their new career. The tour with double occupancy was a great success and was extended, there was also a special 'adult evening show' with standing room. \nHanne, Klaasje and Marthe's first release, \"10.000 Luchtballonnen\" topped the charts in Belgium and The Netherlands. Over 6 years the group released five more albums. In 2016, their own animated series De Avonturen van K3 (The adventures of K3) premiered. That same year there came a new children's television program called Iedereen K3 (Everyone K3). It was the successor to De wereld van K3 (K3's World). At the end of 2016, the special The Diary of K3 was released, in which K3 looks back on the past year. This was an annual tradition until 2018. \nIn 2017, K3 started vlogging, every other week on Saturday there is (usually) a new vlog online on YouTube. That same year, the new K3 got their first movie called K3 Love Cruise and there was a special on VTM: Overal K3 (Everywhere K3), in which Hanne, Klaasje and Marthe showed more of themselves and talked about the impact of K3 on their private lives.\nThe fiction series K3 Roller Disco, was released on 31 October 2018. It's a spin-off of \"Hello K3\", including a same character and actor from the sitcom. For the first time in history, K3 has started roller skating, which is reflected in the Roller Disco series, their video clip of the title song and on stage during their tour in 2018. From 2018, K3 became television judges/coaches on seasons four and five of the Flemish version of The Voice Kids.\n\nIn 2019, the band celebrated their 20th anniversary with a spectacular show with moving stands, stages and LED Walls. Includes a moving car, light-up outfits and more than 80 dancers. In May they opened their own roller coaster in Plopsaland named 'K3 Roller Skater' themed around their roller skates and their fiction series. \nInitially, a new tour was planned to follow in the spring of 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, this tour was postponed to the autumn of 2021. Responding to the crisis, K3 released a new version of their song 'Handjes draaien' (Turning hands) entitled 'Handjes wassen' (Wash hands) to children to explain a little about the illness and provide them with some support.\nThat same year, Hanne, Klaasje and Marthe recorded their second cinema movie K3 Dans van de Farao (K3 Dance of the Pharaoh), entirely in style with the corona rules, which is noticeable in the movie. After postponement, the movie premiered in June 2021.\nFrom 2020, K3 became part of the rhythm game series Just Dance with their songs '10.000 luchtballonnen' and 'Dans van de Farao' in Just Dance 2020 and Just Dance 2021, respectively.\n\n\n=== Search for new member (2021) ===\n\nOn 9 February 2021, member Klaasje announced her departure from K3. \"K3's life is fantastic, but I feel it's time now to spread my wings; just as there is a beginning and an end for everything, now the time has come for me to look further and broaden my horizons. I will miss Hanne and Marthe enormously\". She fulfilled the 2021 group schedules up until the last quarter, including a farewell tour. The last performance of Hanne, Klaasje and Marthe as K3 was on 6 November 2021 at the Sportpaleis for 'Back to the Nineties and Nillies', the same date on which they became K3 six years ago.\nThe label, Studio 100, announced a new member will be cast through a survival show similar to K2 zoekt K3 and K3 zoekt K3. For the first time, both sexes are qualified to join the group. In September 2021, the renewed 'K2 zoekt K3' appeared on Belgian and Dutch television. The audition shows are similar to those of The Voice. The final was on 27 November 2021, when Klaasje Meijer was also present. Marthe De Pillecyn had tested positive for the coronavirus and could not be physically present, she performed by video connection. Ultimately, the Dutch Julia Boschman became the winner, who was chosen as the new member of K3 from a total of 22,690 candidates.\n\n\n=== Further success (2022-) ===\n\nThe first single with Boschman, 'Waterval', was released the same evening and became a great success. Also reached the highest position in the charts in Flanders. It won the \"Song of the Year\" award. The album of the same name also reached a peak in the Album Charts in Belgium and the Netherlands, with 12,000,000 streams. Their song 'Waterval' then featured in Just Dance 2022.\nNow with Julia, they were again television judges/coaches of The Voice Kids in Flanders for season six and they also continued vlogging and releasing music videos of their songs. Hanne, Marthe and Julia's first show tour together, premiered on 4 March 2022 in Belgium. They also did a special live concert in July. After the summer their show tour continued in The Netherlands, but after a number of shows it turned out to be too difficult for the heavily pregnant Hanne Verbruggen to continue. After which it was decided in October that K2 zoekt K3-finalist Diede van den Heuvel would fill in for her for the rest of the shows of the 2022 tour.\nThe song and album 'Vleugels' was released in November, for which they received a gold record. The song was then featured in Just Dance 2023 Edition, where they appear as the dancers in a âVIP Versionâ, instead of the typical Just Dance coaches. Since Hanne was still pregnant during the production process, it was the first Just Dance map to feature a visibly pregnant coach.\n\nThe same year a new TV-show, K3 Vriendenboek was released ('K3 Friendship book') in which they experience adventures with older children. During the ending song of K3's performance at The Grote Sinterklaas Show in December 2022, their good friend and also the daughter of their boss Marie Verhulst, sang for Hanne, who had just given birth to her son at that time.

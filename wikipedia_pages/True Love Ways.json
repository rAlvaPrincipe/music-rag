    "text": "\"True Love Ways\" is a song attributed to Norman Petty and Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly's original was recorded with the Dick Jacobs Orchestra in October 1958, four months before the singer's death. It was first released on the posthumous album The Buddy Holly Story, Vol. 2 (Coral 57326/757326), in March 1960. The song was first released as a single in Britain in May 1960, reaching number 25 on the UK Singles Chart. It was released the following month in the US, but did not make the charts. In 1988, a UK re-release of the recording by MCA, the single reached no. 65 on the UK singles chart in a five-week chart run.\nIn 1965, Peter and Gordon's version became a hit internationally, reaching number 2 in the UK, number 14 in the US Billboard Hot 100 and the top 10 in numerous other countries.\nOther notable covers include Mickey Gilley's 1980 version which reached number 1 on the US Billboard Hot Country Singles chart and Cliff Richard's version that reached the top 10 in the UK and Ireland in 1983 and was a minor hit internationally.\n\n\n== Buddy Holly original ==\n\n\n=== Background and Recording ===\nThe song was recorded at Holly's last recording session before his death on February 3, 1959. The session took place at the Pythian Temple on October 21, 1958 and also included the recordings of \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\", \"Raining in My Heart\", and \"Moondreams\".\nIn the extended version of the song, in the first ten seconds Holly can be heard preparing to sing. The audio starts with audio saying \"Yeah, we're rolling.\" A piano player and a tenor saxophone player play some notes, and Holly mutters, \"Okay,\" and clears his throat. The producer yells, \"Quiet, boys!\" to everyone else in the room, and at the end of the talkback, the producer says, \"Pitch, Ernie\", to signal the piano player to give Holly his starting note, a B-flat.\nHolly biographer Bill Griggs points out that the melody borrows heavily from the gospel song \"I'll Be All Right,\" a favorite of Holly's, and one that would be played at his funeral in 1959. According to Griggs, the framework of the melody was written by Buddy, with the remainder, and lyrics, added by Petty.\nHolly's widow, Maria Elena Holly, claimed that the song was written for her as a wedding gift. On April 29, 2011, she unveiled the never-before-seen \"True Love Ways\" photo of their wedding kiss, now displayed at P.J. Clarke's above Table 53, the table where they became engaged while on their first date, on June 20, 1958.\nA listing of producer Norman Petty's productions claims that Vi Petty, Norman's wife, recorded the first version of this song on June 4, 1958—two weeks prior to Buddy's engagement with Maria. However, only white label promotional copies were pressed (in July).\n\n\n=== Personnel ===\nAl Caiola – guitar\nSanford Block – bass\nErnie Hayes – piano\nDoris Johnson – harp\nAbraham Richman – saxophone\nClifford Leeman – drums\nSylvan Shulman, Leo Kruczek, Leonard Posner, Irving Spice, Ray Free, Herbert Bourne, Julius Held and Paul Winter – violins\nDavid Schwartz, Howard Kay – violas\nMaurice Brown, Maurice Bialkin – cellos\n\n\n=== Releases ===\nUK: \"True Love Ways\" b/w \"Moondreams\" (Coral Q72397, 20 May 1960).\nUSA: \"True Love Ways\" b/w \"That Makes It Tough\" (Coral C62210, June 29, 1960).\nTwo compilation albums by Buddy Holly have used the title of the song.

    "text": "Moulettes, later known as Hannah Moule & The Moulettes, are an English art rock band that combines elements of rock, progressive, folk and pop music. Moulettes are multi-instrumentalists who experiment with the interplay between electric and acoustic instruments through effects and distortion. Led by either a 4, 5 or 6 string cello; the band uses three-part vocal harmony and often incorporates orchestral and progressive elements into their music.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nMoulettes was formed in 2002 in Glastonbury, England by Hannah Miller (vocals, cello), Ruth Skipper (vocals, bassoon), Robert Skipper, Oliver Austin (drums, vocals) and Ted Dwane (bass guitar).

To document the songs that had been played live during that period, Miller, Ruth Skipper, and Austin became a newly arranged three-piece band.

Guest appearances include Liz Green on \"Blood And Thunder\", Banjoist Matt Menefee and Ríoghnach Connolly (folk singer, flute and whistle).\nMiller, Ruth Skipper, Austin, Leach, Arcari and Mortimore toured for the album. During this period Moulettes played festivals, including Cropredy, and toured with the Levellers, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, Mumford and Sons and a support show with Seasick Steve at the Hammersmith Apollo. Leach and Arcari left the band by the end of the album tour.\n\n\n=== Constellations: 2013–2015 ===\nThe band's third album Constellations was released on 2 June 2014 on Navigator Records. Joe Gibb returned to co-produce the album with band member Austin. Special guests include: Herbie Flowers, Arthur Brown, Richardson, Blaine Harrison, The Unthanks, Nick Pynn, Gatrill, Marcus Hamblett, Dan Smith, Houston, Campbell Austin, Hockenhull, Matt Gest, Arslanagic, Simmonds, Bjorn Dahlberg, and Laura Impallomeni.\nMiller, Ruth Skipper, Austin, Mortimore and Arslanagic began to tour the album and were joined by Gatrill, Young and Eliza Jaye at different stages.

The album's lyrical content deals with strange creatures and the natural world. It was produced by the band, mixed by Jim Mortimore, and recorded in the home studio of Malcolm Mortimore after a headline tour in the UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Canada. Moulettes continued to tour Canada and all over Europe. In June 2016, Ruth Skipper left.\n\n\n=== Xenolalia: 2018–present ===\nAs Hannah Moule & The Moulettes, their fifth album Xenolalia (2021) contains 11 songs re-imagined five ways with five different ensembles—a cappella, electric, strings, electronic, and horns—over five separate albums.\n\n\n== Musicianship ==\nMoulettes are a band of multi-instrumentalists who experiment with the interplay between electric and acoustic instruments through effects and distortion.

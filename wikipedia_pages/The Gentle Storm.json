    "text": "The Gentle Storm is a Dutch musical project unveiled in 2014 by singer and lyricist Anneke van Giersbergen and composer and musician Arjen Anthony Lucassen, founder and leader of other musical projects such as Star One, Ayreon, Guilt Machine and Ambeon. The duo has previously collaborated in Ayreon albums Into the Electric Castle and 01011001. The project's debut album, The Diary, was released on March 23, 2015, in Europe, and the following day in the US.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and The Diary (2014â€“2016) ===\nThe project was unveiled on 22 April 2014 and was described by Lucassen as \"an epic double concept album, a combination of 'classical meets metal' and 'acoustic folk'.\" Lucassen's most recurrent collaborator Ed Warby will be featured once again on drums, and it will be his very first album featuring a double bass among the instruments. He confirmed that Johan van Stratum from his former band Stream of Passion would play bass on the album. Also, due to \"unforeseen problems\", Warby had to re-record all his drum parts in one day only. Other former collaborators will be back, such as Joost van den Broek (piano), Ben Mathot (violin) and Maaike Peterse (cello), along with two new guest instrumentalists: Hinse Mutter (double bass) and Jenneke de Jonge (French horn).\nOn September 2, 2014, Lucassen revealed that his collaboration with van Giersbergen was actually a new band, called The Gentle Storm. He stated that van Giersbergen would perform live with band next year, possibly ruling himself out of live shows.\nOn October 10, it was announced at The Gentle Storm's official Facebook profile that the album would comprise two CDs with the same songs, but recorded in totally different arrangements. CD 1 was to be \"the 'Gentle' album, [...] all acoustic and folky with lots of exotic instruments\", while CD2 would be \"the 'Storm' album, [...] an all-out, bombastic orchestral metal album\". The post also stated that there would be \"plenty of progressive elements mixed in\". The post invited fans to ask questions, and some of the answers revealed that the album was set for a March 2015 release, that the band would probably continue if the public reception was good enough and that the concept will be \"a historic love-story\". On 4 November, the album was revealed to be titled The Diary, with a cover art by Alexandra V. Bach, who also drew the art of A War of Our Own by Stream of Passion, another band started by Arjen, but that continued after he left it.\nOn January 20, 2015, the project released two lyric videos for both versions of the song \"Endless Sea\".\nThe Gentle Storm did a small-scale tour in April 2016, after which Lucassen and Van Giersbergen focused on other projects, including together in the Ayreon Universe series of concerts. Van Giersbergen subsequently created the band VUUR, mostly with live members of The Gentle Storm.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\nAnneke van Giersbergen (ex-The Gathering) - lead vocals\nArjen Anthony Lucassen (Ayreon, Ambeon, Star One, Guilt Machine, ex-Stream of Passion) - guitars, keyboards, percussion, hammered dulcimer\nAdditional musicians\nEd Warby (Gorefest) - drums\nRob Snijders (Agua de Annique) - percussion\nJohan van Stratum (Stream of Passion) - bass\nJoost van den Broek (Star One, After Forever) - piano\nTimo Somers (Delain, Vengeance) - guitar solo on \"Heart of Amsterdam\"\nBen Mathot - violin\nHinse Mutter - double bass\nMaaike Peterse - cello\nJenneke de Jonge - French horn\nJeroen Goossens - wind instruments\nJack Pisters - sitar and coral\nMicheal Mills - Irish bouzouki\nRemco Helbers - surbahar\nNathanael van Zuilen - tabla\n\"Epic Rock Choir\" - choir\nLive lineup\nAnneke van Giersbergen - vocals\nFerry Duijsens (Agua de Annique) - guitars\nMerel Bechtold (Delain, MaYaN, Purest of Pain) - guitars\nJohan van Stratum (Stream of Passion)- bass\nMarcela Bovio (Stream of Passion) - backing vocal\nJoost van den Broek - keyboards\nEd Warby - drums\nArjen Anthony Lucassen - acoustic guitar (only on a few dates)\nRuud Jolie (Within Temptation, Maiden UniteD, For All We Know) - Guitars (during South American tour)\nKoen Herfst - drums (during South American tour)\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nThe Diary (2015)\nEPs\nThe Gentle Storm Exclusive Tour CD (2015)\n\n\n== References =="

    "text": "Major Figgas was an American hip hop group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== History ==\nMajor Figgas was founded in the Erie Ave area of Philadelphia by Gillie da Kid, Wallo, and Abliva, who were friends from the neighborhood. They knew Bump J, Dutch and Ressy Rolx from all living in the same area, and eventually expanded after inducting Spade and Bianca. Chops, Rucie, El Dinero and Dirty Rik all soon came aboardâ€¦\nAfter releasing several underground tapes, they released the full-length Figgas 4 Life independently which landed them a deal with RuffNation Records/Warner Bros. Records. Founding member Wallo could not participate in the album as he was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence prior to the recording (Wallo was released in 2017). An expanded edition of the album was issued in 2000, which reached number 115 on the U.S.Billboard 200 and number 29 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Their lone major radio hit was \"Yeah That's Us\", which reached number 2 on the Rap Singles chart and number 34 on the R&B Singles chart.\nSometime after the release of their single \"Yeah That's Us\" and their only album, they left RuffNation and caught the attention of Birdman, who signed them to Cash Money Records/Universal Records. In the progress of working on their next project, member Spade-O was jailed in 2002/2003 for the murder of the cousin of Young Chris, member of the duo Young Gunz and a part of State Property, who was embroiled in a beef with Major Figgas. Soon after, they disbanded.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References =="

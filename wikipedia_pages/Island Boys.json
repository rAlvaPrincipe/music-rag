    "text": "Alex and Franky Venegas (born July 16, 2001), known as Flyysoulja and Kodiyakredd respectively, and known collectively as the Island Boys, are two American twin brothers who became popular on the video sharing platform TikTok in 2021. The brothers are based in Coral Springs, Florida. They went viral with their song \"I'm an Island Boy\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhile in jail as teenagers, the brothers decided to pursue a rap career. In October 2021, a video of the duo performing a song went viral on Twitter. The pair's distinctive appearance, including tattoos, diamond teeth, and vertical dreadlocks helped turn their video into a meme that gained traction on TikTok. They subsequently turned down a record deal with Kodak Black. The original video garnered 9 million views before it was deleted.\nThat November, the duo released a fully produced version of their viral song, \"I'm an Island Boy\", backed by a music video. The twins promoted the release with a poorly received performance at Club LIV in Miami. In May 2022, it was announced that the Island Boys were invited to participate in the reality show Ultimate Social Boxing. That December, the documentary Trolled: The Untold Island Boys Story, detailing the professional and personal lives of the twins, was released.\n\n\n== Personal lives ==\nThe Island Boys are twin brothers. Their given names are Alex and Franky Venegas. They were born on July 16, 2001, and are of Cuban ancestry. In a podcast interview, the twins explained that their father died when they were young and they were raised by their single mother. Growing up, the twins were often in trouble with the law and committed crimes including robbery and burglary, automobile theft, and possessing narcotics. Their mother kicked them out at the age of 18 due to poor behavior. Alex has a daughter.\nIn July 2023, videos of the twins kissing were used to promote their OnlyFans account and subsequently went viral and questions arose about the sexuality of the brothers. It was reported by some outlets that Alex was gay, but, his response to the video, saying he was a 'top' was ultimately ambiguous and he said that his actions with his brother were simply for attention.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Domestic abuse accusations ===\nIn January 2022, Franky Venegas was accused of domestic abuse by Montaisha Shanell on Instagram Live. The two had been romantically involved. Shanell stated that Venegas regularly beat her, with the abuse dating back to at least April of 2021.\nIn March 2022, Franky Venegas was accused of battery after allegedly hitting his brother's girlfriend when she refused to leave their house. No charges were filed.\nIn May 2023, Franky Venegas was arrested for domestic battery in a Pompano Beach AirBNB. He was accused of slapping his girlfriend before pushing her into a shallow pool, injuring her chin. The altercation started after an argument regarding Venegas' past abusive behavior. Venegas was released from Broward County Main Jail later that month.\n\n\n=== Celebrity feuds ===\nThe Island Boys have been involved in multiple online feuds involving other social media personalities such as podcaster Adam22, rapper Blueface, YouTuber Fousey, brothers Logan Paul and Jake Paul, TikTok personality Bryce Hall, and mainstream celebrities such as comedian Kevin Hart and rapper Snoop Dogg. Hart and Snoop Dogg notably mocked the twins on their comedy special \"2021 and Done\". Hart and Snoop Dogg reviewed a collection of the most viral videos of the past year, which included the Island Boys' viral debut. While watching the TikTok clip, Snoop Dogg held his head in his hands, saying, \"I'm speechless. Two goofballs in a pool.\" Hart then responded, \"I'm not speechless. You know why?\" and then began to mockingly sing the Island Boys' song from the video clip.\nThe pair first clashed with Logan Paul after being invited onto his podcast \"Impaulsive\" in December 2021 and disagreeing with Paul's co-host George Janko regarding financial advice. Janko suggested that the brothers invest money from their initial success in case their career as rappers did not prove lucrative in the future. The brothers responded by saying that they did not need financial advice, and Alex addressed Janko by saying \"I probably make more money than you.\" The pair later attended a boxing match in support of Paul, but were allegedly \"kicked out for throwing shoes\" according to online commentator Keemstar. When the twins entered the boxing arena, they were booed by Paul's fans for walking off of \"Impaulsive\". Paul's brother, Jake Paul, discussed the controversy on the next episode of \"Impaulsive\", saying, \"For you to have the audacity to stand up to George Janko, the nicest guy in the world, ... you're a fucking punk.\"\n\n\n=== US Army marketing ===\nIn January 2022, the twins made a commissioned video through Cameo, a platform that allows celebrities to be paid to make custom videos for fans. The video was reposted on TikTok by a Texas-based army recruiter named Orlando Tamez, and shows the brothers saying, \"Big shoutout to Staff Sergeant Tamez, you're changing lives, giving you $50K...Giving out bonuses? Paid vacation? And free college, no money.\" The video was reposted again onto the website Reddit in a subreddit called r/Army. The video sparked controversy and resulted in a representative for the US Army Recruiting Command making the following statement to NBC: \"The Island Boys Cameo was not reviewed, authorized, nor paid for by US Army Recruiting Command as an official marketing tool. We are investigating the situation and requiring the individual recruiter to remove the TikTok account, as it is not authorized for official use at this time.\"\n\n\n=== Association with Andrew James Thomas ===\nOn February 7, 2022, the Venegas brothers' home in Florida was raided by police. A man named Andrew James Thomas, a childhood friend of the Venegas brothers, was arrested on the property in connection to a drive-by shooting that killed an 8-year-old girl just three days before. Alex Venegas claimed that Thomas ran towards him with a gun, asking to hide the weapon in their house. After Venegas refused, Thomas placed the gun in a closet. It was subsequently found by pursuing SWAT personnel. \nThe Venegas brothers were not implicated in the case, and their manager Dovi Bezner told press that the twins' childhood friend had been staying in their home and said, \"We had no clue about any of these allegations towards him. We just knew him as a good person, someone that grew up with the Island Boys. If we knew something like this was going on we never would have allowed him on the property.\" Thomas faced charges of first-degree murder with a firearm, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and attempted first-degree murder with a firearm. He was later sentenced to 45 years in prison for one count of second-degree murder and eight counts of attempted second-degree murder. Following the arrest, Alex Venegas denounced gun violence.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n== References =="

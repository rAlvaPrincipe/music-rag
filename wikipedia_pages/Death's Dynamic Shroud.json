    "text": "Death's Dynamic Shroud (stylized in all lowercase; also known as death's dynamic shroud.wmv under specific releases) is an American electronic and vaporwave trio consisting of James Webster, Tech Honors, and Keith Rankin. The band releases a large amount of music regularly as sample-driven mixtapes under the .wmv moniker, in addition to releasing more standard mainline albums. \nThe band's conception started with just James Webster and Tech Honors in late 2013, releasing their first mixtape (by James) on January 2, 2014. Keith Rankin joined later in August that same year in the co-creation of the first mainline album 신세기 EVANGELIS with James Webster. However, James Webster and Tech Honors had been creating music together and independently, for several years prior. In 2017, with the release of their album Heavy Black Heart, the group used the name, 'death's dynamic shroud' for mainline albums, and 'death's dynamic shroud.wmv' for their NUWRLD mixtape series.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince their teens, Honors and Webster played together in the space rock band, The Sailing, with Honors on vocals and keyboard, and Webster on vocals and guitar. \nIn early 2011, Rankin founded Orange Milk Records with Seth Graham. \nIn 2015, the album I'll Try Living Like This, was released digital and CD-R. Unlike previous Death's Dynamic Shroud albums by Rankin or Webster, I'll Try Living Like This was not produced using the Portastudio, in order to complement the CD-R release. It was ranked #15 out of 50 on FACT Magazine's Top 50 Best Albums of 2015.\n\n\n== Modern Conception ==\nIn 2017 they released Heavy Black Heart under Orange Milk Records, and marked the group's first album with all three members working together. It also marked a slight departure from vaporwaves' typically lo-fi production while still retaining its sample-heavy roots. The band regards the release as an inflection point that defined their creative structure, and saw more standardization of release names and collaborations.\nHonors and Webster would feature together as death's dynamic shroud on the 2018 Neo Gaia Phantasy Tour in Japan, alongside other musicians in the vaporwave scene Equip and R23X. The tour visited Okazaki, Kobe, Kyoto, Osaka, and Tokyo. The setlist played on the tour would later be re-recorded and mastered as a studio album in 2019, Live From Japan, featuring remade songs from previous albums and mixtapes alongside new material. Webster would return for the second Neo Gaia Phantasy Tour in 2019, although Honors would not be able to attend.\nIn late 2020 the NUWRLD Mixtape Club, a Bandcamp subscription service which allowed members access to exclusive death's dynamic shroud mixtapes on a monthly basis was opened to the public. For the first year of the mixtape club, mixtapes were produced by Honors and Webster, alternating each month. Rankin would release his first mixtape for the club, Faith In Persona on November 1, 2021, to favorable reviews and marked a turning point in the group's visibility. It would be released on Spotify and Apple Music a month later.\nIn early 2022 the band announced a new mainline album titled Darklife, again featuring contributions from all three members, which was later released in September to positive reviews. The album was praised for being ambitious and unlike most contemporary electronic music releases. A follow-up album, After Angel, was released in 2023 consisting of material recorded in the same sessions as Darklife, eight songs which were available previously on two EPs, and four new tracks.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== NUWRLD Mixtapes (2014) ===\n\n\n=== Mainline albums (2014–present) ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Judgment Bolt\" (2022)\n\"Neon Memories\" (2022)\n\"Messe de E-102\" (2022)\n\"Fall for Me\" (2022)\n\"You Are Burning Me Up Like This\" (2023)\n\"Phantom You, In Four Parts\" (2023)\n\"The Bleeding of the Sun\" (2023)\n\"Love Heat\" (2023)\n\"What? to be human\" (2023)\n\"Who I Say I Am\" (2023)\n\"Let Them Live\" (2023)\n\"Profane Angelic Function\" (2023)\n\n\n=== NUWRLD Mixtape Club releases (2020–present) ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDeath's Dynamic Shroud on Bandcamp"

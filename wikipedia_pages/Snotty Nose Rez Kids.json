    "text": "Snotty Nose Rez Kids are a First Nations hip hop duo composed of Haisla rappers Darren \"Young D\" Metz and Quinton \"Yung Trybez\" Nyce. They are originally from Kitamaat Village, British Columbia. Their 2017 album The Average Savage was shortlisted for the 2018 Polaris Music Prize, and for the Juno Award for Indigenous Music Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2019. In 2018, the duo received nominations for Best Hip Hop Album at the Indigenous Music Awards, and for Indigenous Artist of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards. Their third album TRAPLINE was released on May 10, 2019 and was later shortlisted for the 2019 Polaris Music Prize. Their fourth album Life After (2021) was shortlisted for the 2022 Polaris Music Prize and was followed by their fifth album I’M GOOD, HBU? in 2022.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMetz and Nyce first connected as writers during high school - Metz wrote poetry and Nyce was a storyteller - realizing they both had a love of hip-hop.

Their single \"Skoden\" was playlisted on CBC Music's Reclaimed, and was named one of the year's 100 best songs by the network. The song received renewed attention in 2018 when a graffiti artist spraypainted \"Skoden\" on the water tower in downtown Sudbury. The word \"Skoden\" is a phrase that means \"let's go then\", and has been a long-standing popular phrase in Indigenous circles.\nIn May 2018, they released the new single \"The Warriors\", a protest song opposing the Trans Mountain Pipeline, and signed to Jarrett Martineau's RPM Records. After a brief stint with RPM, Snotty Nose Rez Kids decided to part ways and release their next album independently. Their third album, TRAPLINE, was released on May 10, 2019.

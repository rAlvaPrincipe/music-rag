    "text": "Sound the Alarm is an American pop rock band from Bangor, Pennsylvania.  The band consists of singer Cody Jancovic, guitarists Joe Brule and Brian Chiusano, bassist Colin Ellis, and drummer Rick Stephans. Their 2007 album, Stay Inside, was released by Geffen Records.\n\n\n== History ==\nSound The Alarm was formed in 1999 by Cody Jancovic, Brian Chiusano, Colin Ellis, Rick Stephans in their hometown of Bangor in Upper Mount Bethel Township, Pennsylvania.  At that time, the band members were only 12 years old.  The four played covers of favorite bands under the name Sleepwell.  \nAfter Joe Brule joined the band, Sleepwell began writing original material and won local acclaim. Working with Rob Freeman, then of Hidden in Plain View, Sleepwell recorded a demo and word spread quickly about the band. \nIn 2004, they were courted by producer Howard Benson while still students at Bangor Area High School. The band changed its name to Sound The Alarm because of a threatened lawsuit by a mattress company alleging that the name \"Sleepwell\" infringed on their copyright. The group graduated early from high school in 2005, newly christened as Sound The Alarm, released an EP on Rock Ridge Music later that year. \nThey then signed with Geffen Records and moved to Los Angeles to record with Howard Benson, releasing their debut full-length, Stay Inside, in July 2007 to mixed reviews. \nThe group has toured with Finch, The Starting Line, Oh, Sleeper, Tokyo Rose, Bedlight For Blue Eyes, and others. The song \"Suffocating\" was covered by Orianthi on her debut album Believe.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nCoin Operated Entertainment EP (Self-released, 2003)\n(released while still known as \"Sleepwell\")\nTrack Listing:\n1.

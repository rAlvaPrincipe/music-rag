    "text": "Ruff Sqwad are an English grime crew. The group was formed in 2001 in Bow, East London. Various members and affiliates of the crew are considered key figures in the early development of grime music.\nRuff Sqwad first became known in the early days of grime for the distinctive production style of the crew's producers. Early Ruff Sqwad instrumentals were released on white label, which are currently rare and fetch high prices on the second hand market. Notable early Ruff Sqwad instrumentals include Pied Piper, Functions on the Low and Misty Cold. Functions on the Low, produced by Ruff Sqwad affiliate XTC has been described as one of the greatest tracks in the history of British electronic music. The crew has released two mixtapes, Guns and Roses Volume. 1 and Guns and Roses Volume. 2, an extended play (2012) as well as an instrumental compilation album, White Label Classics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins: 2001–2005 ===\nRuff Sqwad was formed by a group of teenage school friends in East London in 2001 or 2002. Many of the group's best known instrumentals were made by Rapid and Dirty Danger on cheap home PCs as 14- and 15-year-olds. The group would regularly bunk school to record songs and to press up vinyl at Music House. The crew was active on the London pirate radio scene and at various times during the early 2000s had shows on Rinse FM, Heat, Flava, Mystic, and Deja Vu FM. During this period the group regularly released singles on white label vinyl on an imprint called Ruff Sqwad Recordings following a template laid out by Wiley's Wiley Kat Recordings.\n\n\n=== Mixtape releases: 2005–2006 ===\nIn 2005, Ruff Sqwad's first mixtape, Guns and Roses Volume. 1, was released. It was released in March 2005 on the independent record label Ruff Sqwad Recordings, and was very well received by the grime scene. It has been ranked amongst the best full-length studio albums of all time to come from the grime scene. The album was the first of a three-part album series.\nRuff Sqwad's second mixtape, Guns and Roses Volume. 2, was released in October 2006. It was released on the independent record label Ruff Sqwad Recordings, and was very well received by the grime scene. Along with their debut album, Guns and Roses Volume. 1, it has also been ranked amongst the best full-length studio albums of all time to come from the grime scene. During this period Ruff Sqwad performed regularly at live events including the very first Dirty Canvas night put on by NoHatsNoHoods.\n\n\n=== Decline, breakup and new roster ===\nFollowing the solo success of Tinchy Stryder and other crew members Ruff Sqwad became less active as a group. In 2011 the crew recorded a single called Mario Balotelli. In 2012 Rapid and Dirty Danger collaborated with NoHatsNoHoods to recover recordings previously thought to be lost of some of the group's early instrumentals which led to the release of a compilation album called White Label Classics. The group has been on hiatus since releasing Cold in 2013. In May 2015, Tinchy Stryder confirmed that Ruff Sqwad had split up, citing reasons such as internal conflicts and Slix not making music anymore. In December 2015, a music video for the new song That's Who We Are was released, starring original member Prince Rapid, previous member Fuda Guy and previously affiliated Roachee, all of them seemingly part of Ruff Sqwad.\nThough Ruff Sqwad was not musically active as a group for the most part of 2015, the year showed a resurgence in other grime MC's utilising instrumental productions stemming from former and current members from Ruff Sqwad, such as the song Stormzy – Shut Up which used XTC's Functions on the Low instrumental.\nIn October 2023, music magazine TRENCH hosted a free event at the Adidas Flagship Store on Oxford Street headlined by Ruff Sqwad. Many of the crew's original members including Tinchy Stryder, Dirty Danger, Prince Rapid, Slix and Fuda Guy were involved in the performance, which was quoted as their first in six years. In March 2024, Rapid, Slix (credited as Slix Fleeingham) and Dirty Danger (credited as David Is A King) released a collaborative EP as Ruff Sqwad titled Flee FM, inspired by pirate radio sets.\n\n\n== Members ==\nRuff Sqwad currently has three members: Prince Rapid, Fuda Guy and Roachee. \n\n\n=== Tinchy Stryder ===\nTinchy Stryder (Real name: Kwasi Danquah III, born 14 September 1986), has been a member of the Ruff Sqwad since 2001.

    "text": "Burd & Keyz is a Canadian hip-hop and R&B production group from Markham, Ontario, Canada. Some notable acts they have produced for are Kardinal Offishall, MGK, Meek Mill, Pusha T, and more recently A$AP Ferg, Fabolous, and French Montana.\n\n\n== Music career ==\nAndrew \"Burd\" Liburd and Anthony \"Durty Keyz\" James, were both raised in the Toronto suburb of Markham. The two began producing in high school when they discovered a mutual interest in music, specifically in beat-making and production.\nIn 2004, James and Liburd officially formed the production duo Burd & Keyz.\nOn June 28, 2010, Keyz died of a bacterial infection called streptococcus. He was only 23 years old. A tribute video was released on July 4, 2010.\nBurd still produces music under the name \"Burd & Keyz\".\n\n\n=== Keyz of Life ===\nOn December 13, 2011, Burd released a tribute album to Keyz titled Keyz of Life, and offered it as a free download.\nThe lead single, \"LoveSpeak\", which featured R&B/Soul Toronto native Shi Wisdom and rapper KJ, was released on June 6, 2011. The video was shot at Wisdom's Barber Shop & Beauty Salon in Toronto's Eglinton West neighbourhood. The video was directed by David F. Mewa.\nThe second single, \"Real Nigga Tears (R.N.T.)\", featured Rich Kidd from Toronto and DJ Grouch and was released on August 16, 2011. The video, directed by Sean Getti and featuring Burd himself, was released the next month on September 6, 2011.\nThe third single, \"Faithful\", featured Toronto artists Luu Breeze, A-Game, and Jahron B, with co-production from fellow Toronto native T-Minus and was released on October 26, 2011. The video, directed by Reza Dahya, was released on March 12, 2012.\nThe album received positive reviews and lead to an article about Burd & Keyz on the front page of the National Post arts section  among other reviews.

Hibbs, Abbot Zigler (born Christopher Lee) and later Jeff Paymaster, they signed in 1989 with DJ Magic Mike's Majii label that was part of the  Cheetah Record Company. Following several 12-inch singles, Schnitt Acht (alternately spelled SCHNITT Acht!) released their first album Subhuman Minds in 1990. It was followed in 1993 by Slash and Burn. The second album took a musical turn from the industrial dance style of subhuman Minds towards a more guitar-driven industrial crossover sound. Between 1991 and 1994 the band did a lot of touring, even performing in Europe and making tours in Germany and Romania. After their last tour in 1994, the band split up.\nVirgil later started his own band WIRETRIPN, with which he self-released in 2001 the album Midnight in the Robot Factory via online retailer IUMA.\nPaymaster, with Morgan, and Jan Herkach the techno/rave trio Radioactive Goldfish with whom he released \"LSD Is the Bomb\" which hit #8 of the Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs on March 14, 1992. Later he kept releasing as - among others - Rainbow Bridge and Gypsy Sun, worked as a producer in Florida and run the label Rainbow Bridge Records out of Orlando.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe discography consists of two studio albums and four twelve inches.\n\n\n=== Subhuman Minds (1989/91) ===\n\nSubhuman Minds (or with its subtitle Subhuman Minds on the Firing Line) was the band's first album, released on vinyl in 1990 by Cheetah's Majii label.

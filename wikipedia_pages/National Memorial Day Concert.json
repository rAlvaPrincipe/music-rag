    "text": "The National Memorial Day Concert is a free annual concert  performed on the west lawn of the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., in commemoration of Memorial Day from 1989-2019 and in 2022. In 2020 and 2021, the concert was broadcast on PBS and streamed, but was not live, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is held on the last Sunday of May and on the same day that the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 was held. It is broadcast on PBS, and can also be seen overseas by U.S. military personnel in more than 175 countries and aboard more than 200 U.S. Navy ships at sea on American Forces Network. The concert is viewed and heard by millions across the country and the world, as well as, in every year but 2020 and 2021, attended by more than half a million people at the United States Capitol.\nThe concert usually begins with the American national anthem by the National Symphony Orchestra and the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets, accompanied by a recording artist, followed by music and dramatic readings. The concert's finale begins with a performance of the Armed Forces Medley by the National Symphony Orchestra, accompanied by The U.S. Army Chorus, The U.S. Navy Band Sea Chanters, The U.S. Air Force Singing Sergeants, and The Soldiers' Chorus of the United States Army Field Band, followed by closing remarks by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The 2020 and 2021 concerts were not live because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and instead featured a series of pre-recorded performances and readings along with a tribute to first-responders helping out during the pandemic.\nSince its premiere the multi-award-winning television event honors the military service of all the uniformed service personnel of the Armed Forces and by extension the National Guard Bureau and their families and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the republic and people since the 1775 American Revolution.\n\n\n== National Anthem performers ==\n1992: United States Navy Sea Tenors, and the Army Chorus\n2001: John McDermott\n2007: Josh Turner\n2010: Yolanda Adams\n2011: Pia Toscano (sung acapella)\n2012: Jessica Sanchez\n2013: Candice Glover\n2014: Caleb Johnson\n2015: Nick Fradiani\n2016: Trent Harmon\n2017: Auli ªi Cravalho\n2018: Spensha Baker\n2019: Alyssa Raghu\n2020: Christopher Jackson (sung acapella)\n2021: Mickey Guyton\n2022: Pia Toscano (2)\n2023: Yolanda Adams (2)\n2024: Ruthie Ann Miles\n\n\n== See also ==\nA Capitol Fourth\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"National Memorial Day Concert\" Official Site\n\"Architect Of The Capitol\""

The latter features the song \"Release the Beast\", which was sampled on \"Robot Rock\" by electronic duo Daft Punk.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe band, originally from Philadelphia was formed in 1971.

Their second album Splashdown, which was released in 1980 has been referred to by Tom Bowker of the Broward Palm Beach New Times as a funk masterpiece.\n\n\n== Releases ==\nIn September, 1979, their single \"You Know I Love You\", written by Greg Scott, and produced by Rick Chertoff was a Billboard top single pick.\nFor the week ending July 5, 1980, their album Splashdown at its 8th week in the Billboard charts had moved up from 35 to 34.

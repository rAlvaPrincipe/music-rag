    "text": "The Webb Brothers were an Australian family country music band originating out of Queensland.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFabian (16 July 1930), Marius (19 January 1932) and Berard (4 June 1934) were all born in Gympie,  to Mr and Mrs W. S. Webb. The trio grew up in Upper Widgee, on ''Thornside'' Station, a 5000-acre property west of Gympie.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe Webb Brothers was formed in 1953. That same year at the Buddy Williams Show in Gympie, the boys entered Buddy’s talent quest and won first prize – a recording contract with Rodeo Records. \nIn 1954, the group auditioned for Australia's Amateur Hour and were successful in winning their heat with a massive 13,000 votes from all over Australia.\nIn 1958, Columbia Records released two of their original songs, ''The Call of the Bellbird'' (written by Berard), which sold 40,000 copies by the end of 1959, and ''Just Sing, Sing, Sing'' (written by Fabian and Marius). \nThe Gympie Music Muster was first held on 24-26 September 1982. It grew from a plan to celebrate both the centenary of the Webb family's occupation of the rural property Thornside at Widgee, which was selected by George Slater Webb in 1882 combined with celebrating The Webb Brothers'  25 years in the country music industry and their 1982 Golden Guitar Award for their song \"Who Put the Roo in the Stew?\". \n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n=== Singles and EPs ===\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References =="

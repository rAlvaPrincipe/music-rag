    "text": "Eric's Trip is a Canadian indie rock band from Moncton, New Brunswick. Eric's Trip achieved prominence as the first Canadian band to be signed to Seattle's flagship grunge label Sub Pop in the early 1990s. \nThe band had a minor hit in alternative circles with the single \"View Master\", from the 1994 album Forever Again.\n\n\n== History ==\nEric's Trip formed in 1990 when musicians Rick White and Chris Thompson joined Julie Doiron and Ed Vaughan (who was later replaced by Mark Gaudet). They took their name from a Sonic Youth song and developed a unique sound which fused elements of the distorted guitar of Dinosaur Jr., vocal elements of My Bloody Valentine, the folk leanings of Neil Young, and the lo-fi aesthetic of Sebadoh. White described their sound as \"sappy melodic pop music on top of thick distortion.\" Gaudet's description was more succinct: \"dreamy punk\".\nThe band released their first full-length album, Love Tara, in 1993. and its follow-up Purple Blue in 1996. In between, Eric's Trip played the 1995 edition of the Tragically Hip's Another Roadside Attraction (festival) tour. \n\nEric's Trip went on indefinite hiatus in 1996 and reunited in 2001. They also played a series of shows between 2007 and 2009. These included a show at the 2007 Halifax Pop Explosion and the 2008 edition of Primavera Sound in Barcelona, Spain and the SP20, a 20th anniversary concert for Sub Pop Records that took place in Redmond, Washington. \nThey played at the Sappy Records Festival in Sackville, New Brunswick from 2006 to 2009, with their final performance as a band occurring at the 2009 edition of the festival.  In 2010 both White and Doiron played separate sets at SappyFest.\n\n\n== Post Eric's Trip projects & legacy ==\nDoiron currently has a successful solo career; in 1999, she recorded the album Julie Doiron and the Wooden Stars with the Ottawa band Wooden Stars, which won a Juno Award for Best Alternative Album of the Year, and from 2003 to 2007 she performed with Shotgun & Jaybird. \nWhite and Gaudet played in Elevator until 2009, when White announces the bands dissolution at that years SappyFest. Since then, White has also released three solo albums under the name Rick White Album, The Rick White Album, Memoreaper and 137 during, and after Elevator. Gaudet currently plays in the heavy metal band Funeral Fog. Thompson enjoyed some fame as Moon Socket, and currently plays in The Memories Attack with Ron Bates of Moncton band Orange Glass, as well as the band Diamondtown.\nWhite produced Doiron's solo albums Woke Myself Up (2007) and I Can Wonder What You Did with Your Day (2009). Woke Myself Up features three tracks on which the entire Eric's Trip lineup contributed to the recording, their first studio collaboration since the band's 1996 breakup, while I Can Wonder has been described by critics as directly revisiting the sound and style of Eric's Trip for the first time in Doiron's solo career.\nA two-disc CD tribute album, titled Songs For Eric: A Tribute to Eric's Trip featuring Eric's Trip songs covered by artists influenced by the band,  released by Gooseberry Rcords, in April 2009.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nRick White – vocals, guitar (1990–present)\nJulie Doiron – bass, guitar, vocals (1990–present)\nChris Thompson – guitar, bass, drums, vocals (1990–present)\nEd Vaughan – drums (1990–1991)\nMark Gaudet – drums, vocals (1991–present)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== EPs/cassettes ===\nEric's Trip cassette (Independent) – Dec 1990\nCatapillars EP cassette (Independent) – Apr 1991\nDrowning EP cassette (Independent) – Aug 1991\nWarm Girl cassette (Independent) – Jan 1992\nBelong 7-inch EP (NIM) – Apr 1992\nPeter cassette/CD (Murderecords), LP (Sub Pop Germany) – Apr 1993\nSongs About Chris 7-inch EP (4 songs) / CD5 (6 songs) (Sub Pop) – May 1993\nJulie and the Porthole to Dimentia 7-inch EP (One solo track by each of the four members) (Sappy Records) – Jul 1993\nTrapped In New York 7-inch EP (Summershine Records) – 1993\nWarm Girl 7-inch EP (Derivative) – 1993\nThe Gordon Street Haunting 7-inch EP / CD5 (Sub Pop) – May 1994\nThe Road South 7-inch EP (Sonic Unyon) – Aug 1995\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nLove Tara (Sub Pop) – Nov 1993\nForever Again (Sub Pop) – Sep 1994\nPurple Blue (Sub Pop) – Jan 1996\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nThe Eric's Trip Show live CD (Teenage USA) – 2001\nLive in Concert November 4th, 2001 live CD (Great Beyond) – 2001\nLive at The Esquire May 1995 live archival digital streaming release (no label) – January 2020\nLive in Montreal - March 16th, 1993 live archival digital streaming release (no label) – October 2022\n\n\n=== Splits ===\n\"Laying Blame\" b/w Stove-Smother Split 7-inch with Sloan (Cinnamon Toast Records) – 1994\nPillow (Red) b/w Payday and Don't Spook the Horse...

It's reflecting on past regrets but instead of Yesteryear where it's kind of got this hint of optimism to it, 'Titanic' is kind of pessimistic. It's like the moment just before everything spirals downwards.\"\nIn April 2024, Cosmo's Midnight announced the release of their third studio album, Stop Thinking Start Feeling.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== APRA Awards ===\nThe APRA Awards are held in Australia and New Zealand by the Australasian Performing Right Association to recognise songwriting skills, sales and airplay performance by its members annually.\n\n\n=== ARIA Music Awards ===\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual ceremony presented by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), which recognise excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of the music of Australia.

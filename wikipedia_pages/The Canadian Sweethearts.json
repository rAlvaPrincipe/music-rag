The duo consisted of vocalist Lucille Starr and her guitar-playing husband, Bob Regan. They are best known for the rockabilly song, \"Eeny Meeny Miney Moe\". Their contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== History ==\nRegan was born Robert Frederickson on March 13, 1931, in Rolla, British Columbia. As a child he played harmonica, guitar, mandolin and fiddle. Starr was born Lucille Marie Raymonde Savoie on May 13, 1938, in St. Boniface, Manitoba. In 1958, Regan had been performing in his brother Keray's band, The Peace Rangers, and had recorded a single, \"Teenage Boogie\"/\"I Will Never Hold Another\", singing a duet with his sister Fern on the B-side. Starr had performed in the French band Les Hirondelles and later as a solo singer. They met at a wedding and began performing together.

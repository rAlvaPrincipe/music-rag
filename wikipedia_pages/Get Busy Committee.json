Their debut album, Uzi Does It, was released for pre-sale download on October 27, 2009, at www.getbusycommittee.com, and available on iTunes and other outlets on November 10, 2009. The album is a 100% self-funded and self-released independent record.\n\nLike, my album is underground. Demigodz is super underground. But Get Busy Committee is gonna be something really fuckin’ crazy. We have Topspin Media behind us. We have [Mike] Shinoda behind us. We got the dudes at MySpace Music heavily behind us. So Get Busy Committee is gonna be something else...[And] if you don’t like it, I don’t know what to tell you.\n\n\n== Future ==\nAs of 2012, Get Busy Committee is on hiatus, or \"dead\" as they refer to the status of the group.

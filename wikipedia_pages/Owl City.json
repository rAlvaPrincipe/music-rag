    "text": "Owl City is an American electronic music project created in 2007 in Owatonna, Minnesota. It is one of several projects by singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Adam Young, who created the project while experimenting with music in his parents' basement. Owl City developed a following on the social networking site Myspace, like many musicians who achieved success in the late 2000s, before signing with Universal Republic Records, now Republic Records, in 2008.\nAfter two independent releases, Owl City gained mainstream popularity with its 2009 major-label debut album, Ocean Eyes, which includes the Diamond certified single \"Fireflies\". The album was certified 2× Platinum in the United States, with \"Fireflies\" being certified Diamond in January 2023.\nIn June 2011, Owl City released its third studio album, All Things Bright and Beautiful, which was followed by The Midsummer Station in August 2012. Owl City has recorded songs for several animated films, including Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, Wreck-It Ralph, The Croods and The Smurfs 2. Owl City also has released several charting singles, most notably \"Good Time\" and \"Fireflies\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2007–2009: early years, Of June and Maybe I'm Dreaming ===\nAdam Young has attributed the name Owl City to a number of sources. His official blog says it derives from the short film An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (1962), due to his identification with the protagonist. In other interviews, he has referred to his sister's pet owl, as well as to an owl that met its demise on the windshield of his father's truck. He has also described seeing a large number of owls in a forest in Scotland while visiting his grandmother.\nSuffering from insomnia while working loading Coca-Cola trucks, Young began to compose music, recording with a C-1 Behringer Microphone. Among the software that he began with was Reason from Propellerhead. He began uploading songs recorded in his parents' basement to MySpace. \"Hello Seattle\" was the first track written for Owl City, which also inspired the project. After receiving favorable attention for his music, he began receiving emails from major record labels in the spring of 2008. His manager Steve Bursky later highlighted the significance of Young's engaging online manner in building his following saying: \"People feel like they know him, like they've got a direct connection to him because of how he approaches his connection with them online.\" Through a deal with the digital aggregator CD Baby, he then started making the songs available for sale through iTunes. In 2007, Owl City released an EP titled Of June, followed by the 2008 release of the album Maybe I'm Dreaming. Of June reached No. 15 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart, and Maybe I'm Dreaming peaked on the same chart at No. 13. The song, \"The Technicolor Phase\" from his debut album, was featured in the soundtrack of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland.\nIn February 2009, Owl City signed with Universal Republic. He played his first show to a sold-out crowd at the Varsity Theater in Minnesota. He continued to perform shows from May to June 2009. In May, Owl City performed at the 2009 Bamboozle festival.\n\n\n=== 2009–2010: Ocean Eyes ===\nOcean Eyes, Owl City's major label debut, was released on iTunes on July 14, 2009, with the physical release following on July 28, 2009. The album peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200 and topped the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart for four weeks. By April 2010, it was certified Platinum in the United States. The album was mostly recorded in his parents' basement, before Young got his own place and finished it up there. Owl City released his debut single, \"Fireflies\" on July 14, 2009. The song became a commercial success, topping the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States for the week ending November 7, 2009. Internationally, the song also topped the charts in Ireland, Australia, Denmark and Holland. \"Fireflies\" was featured as iTunes' \"Single of the Week\" and garnered 650,000 downloads. A music video for the song premiered in 2009 and was directed by Steve Hoover. \"Fireflies\" also reached the No. 1 spot in the UK and was the 20th most downloaded song of all time in the country. \"Vanilla Twilight\" was released on January 26, 2010 as the second single from the album. The song debuted at No. 95 on the Billboard Hot 100, the same week \"Fireflies\" hit No. 1. The song eventually peaked at No. 72 on the chart. The music video for \"Vanilla Twilight\" was released on March 22, 2010 and features a cameo appearance from Shaquille O'Neal. The album's third and final single, \"Umbrella Beach\" was released on May 16, 2010 and peaked at No. 110 on the UK Singles Chart.\nYoung was joined by Breanne Düren on several tracks; the most notable example of which is \"The Saltwater Room\". The track \"Sunburn\", is featured on Soundtrack 90210 which was released on October 13, 2009. The song \"Hello Seattle\" found commercial success peaking at number 12 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and was certified Gold by the RIAA. In the fall of 2009, Owl City embarked on a headlining tour that began in October to November. He continued to tour in early 2010 to support the album. Owl City has toured with The Scene Aesthetic, Lights, John Mayer, Maroon 5, Brooke Waggoner and Relient K.\n\nIn 2010, Young revealed a new musical project known as Sky Sailing, which moved away from his usual electronica genre of music and introduced acoustic guitar and piano accompaniments into his work. The unrefined tracks were recorded in the summer of 2007 before he began making music as Owl City. His first album under this new project is entitled An Airplane Carried Me to Bed, and was released on July 13, 2010, via iTunes.\nYoung collaborated with English electronic musician Chicane and released the single \"Middledistancerunner\" on July 30, 2010, featuring Young on vocals. He also worked with Dutch producer Armin van Buuren, appearing on a track called \"Youtopia\" from the van Buuren album Mirage. In August 2010, \"To the Sky\" was officially released on the soundtrack for Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'hoole. On October 25, 2010, Young released a cover version of Keith Getty & Stuart Townend's modern hymn \"In Christ Alone\" for streaming on his website.\nTaylor Swift's song \"Enchanted\", released on October 25, 2010, was rumored to be about the time she met Adam Young. Young recorded his cover of \"Enchanted\" as a response, altering the lyrics to address Swift directly. He posted the recording on his website on February 13, 2011. He released a Christmas single called \"Peppermint Winter\" in November 2010.\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: All Things Bright and Beautiful ===\nProduction on Young's third studio album began around mid-2010 after he returned home from his Ocean Eyes World Tour, with Young being announced as the executive producer of the album. Young also worked with engineer and producer Jack Joseph Puig on the album.

However, on April 6, Young released a statement on his website, along with lengthy previews of four of his songs (\"Dreams Don't Turn to Dust\", \"Alligator Sky Featuring Shawn Chrystopher\", \"Galaxies\", and \"Deer in the Headlights\"), that the release date for All Things Bright and Beautiful would be pushed back to June 14. In March 2011, Owl City announced the All Things Bright and Beautiful World Tour. The album debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of 48,000 copies.\n\n\"Alligator Sky\" was released as the lead single from the album on March 22, 2011, which features rapper Shawn Chrystopher. The music video for the song premiered on May 6. Young discussed the concept in a making-of video posted on Owl City's VEVO account, \"The concept is basically about these two guys who are leaving Earth. Rather than it being this very dark post-apocalyptic vibe, it's very optimistic, and so it's like people are excited to leave earth.\" The song, \"Galaxies\" was released as the second single from the album on April 19, 2011. Young stated that the song is about the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.\n\"Deer in the Headlights\" was released on iTunes on May 23, 2011, as the first promotional single from the album.

During the month of July at the Club Nokia concert in Los Angeles, Young announced that the concert was being filmed for a Live DVD. The recording entitled, Owl City: Live From Los Angeles, was eventually released on iTunes in December 2011. On November 15, 2011, Jumeirah released a commercial for their famous Burj Al Arab luxury hotel which Young was called upon to compose the music for the commercial.\n\n\n=== 2012–2013: The Midsummer Station ===\nOn January 2, 2012, Young wrote an entry on his blog regarding his fourth full-length album. Young said that he would be collaborating with more producers and songwriters, saying that his new record \"Marks a flying leap in this direction\". In an interview with Billboard, Young revealed that the new album is around 80–85% complete, and that Dr. Luke, JR Rotem, Norwegian production team Stargate, Brian Kennedy and Emily Wright are involved with the production of the album. Young expected the album to be released around the summer of 2012.\nYoung, along with Jewel and Jay Sean, released a song in promotion of the Child Hunger Ends Here campaign by ConAgra Foods entitled \"Here's Hope\". On April 17, 2012, \"Dementia\", a song by Young which was included on his upcoming album surfaced onto the internet and features additional vocals by Mark Hoppus of Blink-182.\nYoung released a new EP, Shooting Star, on May 15 and features four songs off his upcoming album, so that fans a could get clear taste of what the album would sound like. The EP spawned the single, \"Shooting Star\" which peaked at number 36 on the US Hot Christian Songs chart. On May 24, 2012, Young announced on Twitter that Owl City's fourth studio album would be titled The Midsummer Station.

Young stated that his new music would contain more EDM songs and claimed that his new album would be \"edgy\". He also hoped to record a song for the album with Ellie Goulding.

Young stated that he intended to release a steady \"series of EPs\" in 2014 rather than one larger recording.

During each month of 2016, he composed and recorded a score based on a subject of his choice, which is something he had wanted to accomplish for a long time. On February 1, 2016, the first score, which is based on the Apollo 11 mission, was released on Young's \"Adam Young Scores\" website. This was followed by 10 additional scores on the first day of each month of 2016.

Young described the album as a \"very Owl City album,\" containing themes of \"autobiographical\", \"metaphorical\", and \"odd\" songs. \"Vitamin Sea\" was released on March 3, 2023, as the third and final single from the album. Coco Moon peaked at number 94 on the US Top Current Albums Sales chart. In support of the album, Young announced the To the Moon Tour that began in the fall of 2023 with support from special guest Augustana. In September 2023, Young made a guest appearance on the deluxe edition of The Beautiful Letdown (Our Version) by Switchfoot, performing the song \"Gone\".

Young released a cover of Augustana's \"Boston\" as a single on February 9. On March 22, Owl City released the deluxe edition of Coco Moon, which featured the single \"Car Trouble\".\n\n\n== Musical styles and influences ==\nOwl City's music is described as indietronica and synth-pop and is often described as belonging to the electronic music genre. Young has stated that he is inspired by disco and European electronic music, as well as instrumental genres such as drone, ambient, and post-rock. He cites his biggest influences as Johnathon Ford of Unwed Sailor and Thomas Newman. As he is a vocal Christian, Young also incorporates his faith into some of his music. Young's faith is evident on the album, All Things Bright and Beautiful, especially in the song \"Galaxies\". Explaining why the faith-filled song was added to the mix he said, \"I feel like, if I were ever to hide the fact that that's what's so important to me, it would be a crime that I should probably be put in jail for.\"\nOwl City also has been compared to the Postal Service, often critically, for his combination of fuzzy synths, ironic lyrics, and use of female guest singers. Pitchfork goes to say that \"the surprise No. 1 single in the country, Owl City's 'Fireflies', jacks the Postal Service in such a bald-faced, obvious manner that getting into specifics feels redundant at best and tacky at worst.\" In response to the suggestion that his work is derivative, Young suggested in a 2009 interview with The New York Times that Ocean Eyes is perhaps the \"next chapter\" after the Postal Service: \"The Postal Service released a record in 2003, and that was it. There was really nothing to compare it to until someone else came along and wrote the next chapter. Maybe that's this record. Maybe that's this band.\"\n\n\n== Touring band ==\nOwl City is one of Young's many solo projects, with all music written, composed, recorded, and produced by him.

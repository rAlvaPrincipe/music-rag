    "text": "Girlyman was an American folk-rock band formerly based in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, later based in Atlanta, Georgia. Its 2003 self-released debut album, Remember Who I Am, sold 5,000 copies before it was re-released by Daemon Records, the independent record label run by Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls. Girlyman described its musical style as \"harmony-driven gender pop\" and \"leading-edge three-part harmony folk-pop,\" and enjoyed a strong following in the gay community.\nIn late 2012, Girlyman took a hiatus from touring. Greenstein and Borofsky both began work on solo albums, while Muramatsu, Jones, and Borofsky announced they had formed a new group called Django Jones. Greenstein's  album One True Thing and Borofsky's Every Wish were released in 2013.\nOn September 11, 2013, Muramatsu announced that Girlyman had officially disbanded.\nIn 2014, Django Jones released the children's album D is for Django, and Greenstein announced a new musical act, Mouths of Babes, with her partner Ingrid Elizabeth.\n\n\n== Members ==\nGirlyman had four members:\n\nTylan \"Ty\" Greenstein (vocals, lead guitar, mandolin and percussion)\nDoris Muramatsu (vocals, acoustic guitar, mandolin and bluegrass banjo)\nNate Borofsky (vocals, baritone guitar, bass guitar)\nJJ Jones (drums and percussion).\nThe founding members were Greenstein, Muramatsu and Borofsky. Before they came together, Borofsky was an award-winning singer-songwriter, while Greenstein and Muramatsu (best friends since second grade in Princeton Junction, New Jersey) were the award-winning duo The Garden Verge.\nIn late 2010, Doris Muramatsu was diagnosed with leukemia, which led to the band taking a brief hiatus.\nJones was the drummer for Po' Girl, a group that frequently toured with Girlyman, before joining the group on January 3, 2010.  According to the Girlyfan email update (signed by the entire group): \"JJ Jones is an old friend and a fantastic drummer whom we've crossed paths with many times over the years, and when we finally got to play with her over the past couple months, something just clicked.  Our sound got bigger and closer to what we had all imagined it to be for years.\"  Jones and Doris Muramatsu were romantically involved.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Girlyman ===\nRemember Who I Am\nIndependently released in fall of 2003, re-released nationally September 7, 2004 on Daemon Records.\nLittle Star\nReleased May 24, 2005 on Daemon Records.\nJoyful Sign\nReleased nationally on April 13, 2007, with a special edition released earlier to fans; Joyful Sign contains fourteen new original songs, was produced by Girlyman and Bob Harris, and features drummer Joe Chellman.\nSomewhere Different Now (Live)\nReleased nationally on May 1, 2008; includes previously unreleased songs, tuning songs, and banter from live shows.\nEverything's Easy\nReleased to pre-order customers in July 2009; release party and concert at Eddie's Attic in Decatur, Georgia, on August 1, 2009.\nSupernova\nReleased to pre-order customers in November 2011; the CD became generally available on June 19, 2012; the release was supported by a number of shows.\nCompilation appearances\n\n\"Amaze Me\" on Amaze Me: Songs in the Key of Peace (2003)\n\"Viola\" on Sounds Like This ...

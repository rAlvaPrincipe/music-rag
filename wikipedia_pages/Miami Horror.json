    "text": "Miami Horror are an Australian electronic music group from Melbourne, Victoria. Benjamin Plant, the producer and DJ, formed Miami Horror initially as a solo project. In addition to Plant, the band features Daniel Whitechurch (keyboards), and currently Rhythm Luna (drums), while featuring different vocalists and guitar players including Reva Devito (vocals), TC Milan of Crush Club (vocals), Nicolas Mulhall of Queen Magic (guitar), and Tom Frazer (guitar). The band takes influence from dance and rock artists of the 1970s and 1980s such as Prince, New Order, Todd Rundgren, and Pink Floyd, combining it with modern production techniques from styles such as house and pop music.\nPlant debuted in the music scene with his EP Bravado, released in 2008. His debut album Illumination was released in 2010 and debuted at Number 10 on the Australian Chart, which featured collaborations with Josh Moriarty and Daniel Whitechurch, along with features from Neon Indian and Kimbra, while their second more collaborative album, All Possible Futures, in 2015.

Additionally, they have remixed songs from other artists such as Gorillaz, Pnau, Ratatat, and Phantogram, among others.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn 2007, Plant began releasing remixes under the moniker Miami Horror; their instantaneous blog success led him to leave film school and pursue a career in music. A series of both bootleg and official remixes included Stardust's \"Music Sounds Better with You\" and Tegan and Sara's \"Walking with a Ghost\", along with contemporary Australian acts such as the Midnight Juggernauts, Faker, and The Presets. According to Plant, the name Miami Horror \"was just a visual thing. I thought both words were pretty bold in themselves, but also have quite a strong visual side. Miami representing the colorful and flamboyant side, while horror represents the darker.\" He has said that he \"didn't like it for the first two weeks\", but he \"learnt to live with it\".\nPlant began his music career early on, producing music at home from a young age, often DJing at house parties and regular weekly Melbourne club nights such as Streetparty and Third Class. In 2008 he remixed Pnau, The Presets, and Bloc Party. Miami Horror has also collaborated with Melbourne electropop group Gameboy/Gamegirl in 2007 and produced the Golden Ghetto Sex EP which featured the single \"Sweaty Wet/Dirty Damp\", a one-off single that became a left-field hit in the music blogosphere the same year.\nAs Miami Horror, Plant made his commercial debut in 2008 with a five-track EP, Bravado, on Virgin Records. The EP features the song \"Don't Be on with Her\", for which a promotional video was released online. Miami Horror has since been signed to EMI for distribution in Australia and France.\nMiami Horror's live show is formed by Benjamin Plant (bass, keyboards), Daniel Whitechurch (bass, keyboards, and guitars), and Rhythm Luna(drums) with various other members providing vocals and guitar depending on the tour. The live incarnation of Miami Horror has appeared at Coachella, Corona Capital, Governors Ball, Groovin The Moo, Splendour in the Grass, Electric Forest and many more. The band has also supported Phoenix, and Friendly Fires on their Australian tours.\nIn late 2009 the band released their first major single \"Sometimes\" to commercial success, receiving frequent airplay on radio stations and club circuits. They later released their debut album Illumination on 20 August 2010 with debuted at number 10 on the ARIA Charts, with further singles including \"Moon Theory\" and \"I Look to You\" (the latter featuring Kimbra), each single receiving a music video alongside them. The fourth single, \"Holidays\", received a music video as well. \nOn September 10, 2013, the roll-out for their second album, All Possible Futures started with the release of \"Real Slow\", a collaboration with Sarah Chernoff. Coincidencially, Grand Theft Auto V was released the following week, where \"Sometimes\" was featured as part of its in-game radio station, Radio Mirror Park.

The album itself was released on 21 April 2015. It debuted at number 65 on the ARIA Albums Chart in May 2015, with later singles including \"Love Like Mine\" (also with Cleopold), and \"Cellophane (So Cruel)\" (with Aaron Tiem & Gavin Turek).

    "text": "The Tulsa Youth Symphony Orchestra (TYS) is an Oklahoma nonprofit arts organization founded in 1963 to provide advanced orchestral training and performance experience for young musicians in Northeastern Oklahoma. As of 2016, more than 200 students, ages 8 to 18, participate in the program’s two orchestras. The orchestra is composed of students from northeast Oklahoma communities and schools including Tulsa, Bartlesville, Owasso, Sapulpa, Sand Springs, Broken Arrow, Bixby, Coweta, Grove, Oologah, Jenks, and Holland Hall, as well as home schooled children.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Tulsa Youth Symphony Orchestra began as an educational wing of the Tulsa Philharmonic in the early 1960s. In October 1962, Tulsa Philharmonic Society President Burch Mayo appointed a committee of six Society board members to explore the possibility of establishing a Tulsa Youth Symphony Orchestra. The committee members included Bonnibel Lester, Betty Bradstreet, C.A. Astle, Herbert Gussman (founder of the Tulsa Philharmonic), Dr. Robert L. Briggs and Gerald Whitney. Briggs was the chair of the music department at the University of Tulsa and Whitney was Supervisor of Music for the Tulsa Public Schools. Mrs. Lester chaired the committee. The board members had extensive ties in the music world - Gussman's friendships included Isaac Stern, Leonard Bernstein, Eugene Istomin, and Jan Pierce.  The 78 member Youth Symphony gave its debut concert on February 15, 1964, in the Tulsa Municipal Theater - now known as the Brady Theater.  They performed Howard Hanson's Symphony No. 2.  The featured soloist was the orchestra's Principal Trumpet, Phil Driscoll. A second concert was given May 9, also in the Municipal Theater.  In August 1965, Tulsa hosted the National Youth Symphony convention at the Mayo Hotel; Maestro Franco Autori, conducted the convention orchestra.  Mrs. Richard Nixon attended a Tulsa Youth Symphony concert in her honor May 13, 1971.\nIn the fall of 2003 the Tulsa Youth Symphony added another orchestra, the \"Concert Orchestra.\" In 2016, a Preparatory String Orchestra was added. Currently TYS has four conductors: Richard Wagner, Symphony Orchestra Conductor; Pete Peterson, Concert Orchestra Conductor; Kenneth Baird, Assistant Concert Orchestra Conductor; and Amelia Ivory, Preparatory Orchestra Conductor.\n\n\n== Chamber Orchestra ==\nIn 1989 the Tulsa Youth Symphony added a Chamber Orchestra which performed at All Souls Unitarian Church in the spring.  This provided an opportunity for the best orchestra members to perform in a small group and to appear as soloists. The Youth Symphony also provides free children's concerts.\n\n\n== Conductors ==\nThe search for a conductor commenced in early 1963, and by April the board had selected Max Waits. Waits was Principal Flute of the Tulsa Philharmonic and Assistant Professor of Flute and Piano at the University of Tulsa. In May, he named as assistants Robert McNally, Principal Second Violinist of the Philharmonic, and Mr. Eugene Schweiger, Principal Cellist of the Philharmonic.\nRobert McNally took over as conductor in the 1966-67 season, and remained through the 1971-72 season. At that time, McNally was appointed Concertmaster of the Tulsa Philharmonic, and Ron Wheeler became Youth Symphony Conductor in the 1972-73 season. Wheeler had been the assistant conductor of the Youth Symphony since 1970. He was also a violinist in the Tulsa Philharmonic, and Production Manager of the Philharmonic.\nRon Wheeler  was conductor and executive director of the Tulsa Youth Symphony Orchestra from 1972 through 2021.  He was on the Oral Roberts University music faculty for fourteen years. Mr. Wheeler designed and conducted concerts for young audiences with the Tulsa Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra and the Sunriver, Oregon Music Festival Orchestra, and presented adult educational lectures for the Tulsa Philharmonic, Tulsa Opera, Tulsa Public Library and California State University at Los Angeles.  He conducted at music camps and festivals in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, California, Oregon, and North Dakota, and is an honorary member of Sigma Alpha Iota International Music Fraternity as a National Arts Associate. Wheeler currently performs as a violinist with the Tulsa Symphony Orchestra.\nIn March 1981 Youth Symphony Assistant Conductor Grant Cooper, a native New Zealander conducted the American Premiere of Aotearoa by contemporary composer Douglas Lilburn, also a New Zealander.\nRichard Wagner has been with the Tulsa Youth Symphony since 2002 and is currently Music Director at Tulsa Youth Symphony and the conductor of the Symphony Orchestra. He also is the Director of Instrumental Music at Bixby High School in Bixby, Oklahoma, and is in his seventh year as the conductor of the University of Tulsa Symphony Orchestra.  Richard has been on the faculties of Oklahoma State University and the Oklahoma Summer Arts Institute at Quartz Mountain.\nEarl \"Pete\" Peterson's is currently Concert Orchestra Conductor.  Pete Peterson has served as cellist with the Gettysburg Symphony, Tulsa Philharmonic, Tulsa Opera, Tulsa Ballet, Tulsa Symphony Orchestra and Signature Symphony.

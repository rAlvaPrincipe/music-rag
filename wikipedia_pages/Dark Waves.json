    "text": "Dark Waves is an American indie pop band from Los Angeles, California, United States, formed by frontman Nick Long in 2014.\nThe group has released one self-titled EP Dark Waves (2014) and plans to release a full album in summer of 2015.\nDrawing notable comparisons to bands such as The Neighbourhood and Bad Suns, the sound of Dark Waves has been described by Buzzbands L.A. as \"electro-romantic\", \"afloat in the unsettling, gloomy currents of love and longing\".\n\n\n== History ==\nNick Long was raised in Santa Barbara, California.  His parents encouraged an interest in music from a young age: they bought him his first drum kit at age 5, piano lessons at age 6, and for his 8th birthday, his dad gave him a guitar.\nLong belonged to punk bands Staring Back and Dead Country before forming Dark Waves. “I would write these songs and they would be kind of mello, synthy songs [with] acoustic guitars, and then I would take it to my band and we would turn it into a big rock song. “As much I love punk and rock and stuff like that, I just didn’t really want to be taken to that place anymore. The songs just felt better and more natural in the first form that they came in.”\n\n\n=== Dark Waves EP (2014) ===\nDark Waves released their self-titled EP in September 2014.  The debut single off the EP, \"The Heartbeat The Soul\", has been streamed over two million times on Spotify.\nThe newly released \"I Don’t Wanna Be In Love\", featured in an episode of Vampire Diaries, hit #2 on the Hype Machine’s most popular chart. \"I wrote this song toward the end of a relationship,\" says Long. \"I didn't realize how weighed down I felt until after it ended, but I knew something wasn't right. It made me sad to feel disconnected from someone that I once felt so close to. The song is basically me taking a look at my situation and being honest with myself about how I felt.\"\nDark Waves supported New Zealand's alt-pop songstress Brooke Fraser on her Brutal Romantic tour in January and February 2015 and will play the South By Southwest Music Festival in March 2015.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\nNick Long – Vocals, Multiple Instruments (2014–present)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== EPs ===\nDark Waves (2014)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"I Don't Wanna Be In Love\" (2014)\n\"The Heartbeat the Soul\" (2014)\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n== References =="

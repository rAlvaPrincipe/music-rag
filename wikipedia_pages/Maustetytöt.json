    "text": "Maustetytöt (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈmɑu̯steʔˌtytøt]; lit. 'spice girls') is a Finnish girl group consisting of sisters Anna Karjalainen and Kaisa Karjalainen. The band's trademarks include a laconic and serious-looking performance style.\nOriginally from Vaala, Maustetytöt listen to traditional Finnish schlager, and their role model is Leevi and the Leavings. The band's record company Is This Art! describes Maustetytöt as an \"indie pop duo\".\nMaustetytöt won the Rock of the Year and Band of the Year awards at the Emma Awards in 2020. Oskari Onninen from Helsingin Sanomat describes the band as \"downright suspiciously 'authentic' and non-commercial\". According to Antti Luukkanen from Soundi, the songs contain \"everyday realism and the glamor of downright misery\".\nMaustetytöt achieved international fame when they appeared in Aki Kaurismäki's 2023 film Fallen Leaves, performing the song \"Syntynyt suruun ja puettu pettymyksin\" (\"Born in sorrow and clothed in disappointment\"). According to critic Esther Zuckerman from The New York Times, Maustetytöt is an \"impossibly cool modern Finnish duo\". Also, Bilge Ebiri from Vulture finds the Maustetytöt part in the film a \"showstopping appearance\". With the publicity brought by the film, Maustetytöt has accumulated many foreign music tours, such as in Sweden and Germany.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one albums of 2019 (Finland)\nList of number-one albums of 2023 (Finland)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Maustetytöt at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial Site (in Finnish)"

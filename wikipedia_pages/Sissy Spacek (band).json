    "text": "Sissy Spacek is an American noise band founded in 1999 in Los Angeles and currently consisting of official members John Wiese and Charlie Mumma, along with several collaborators both past and present. Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 2001, they have released a considerable catalogue encompassing genres which include harsh noise, noisecore, grindcore, free improvisation and musique concrete. Early releases consisted of collages of previously recorded demos and live performances with heavy use of cut-up editing. Many works have been released or re-released on Wiese's own label, Helicopter.\nPast members or collaborators include Corydon Ronnau, Jesse Jackson, Danny McClain, Sara Taylor (Youth Code), Aaron Hemphill (Liars), Kevin Drumm, as well as Merzbow, Smegma, Hijokaidan and The Haters.\nThe band was ranked fourth in LA Weekly's 2015 article \"The 20 Best Punk Bands in L.A. Right Now\".\nIn 2018, the band toured the US and Japan.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nSissy Spacek (Helicopter/PACrec/A Dear Girl Called Wendy, 2001) - Italy\nScissors (Helicopter/Misanthropic Agenda, 2002)\nRemote Whale Control (Helicopter/Misanthropic Agenda, 2003)\nDevils Cone And Palm (Helicopter/Misanthropic Agenda, 2006)\nFrench Record (Tape Room/Dual Plover, 2008) - Australia\nCalifornia Ax (Helicopter, 2008)\nGlass (Misanthropic Agenda, 2009)\nGore Jet (Sweat Lung, 2009) - Australia\n15-Tet Oakland (Misanthropic Agenda, 2010)\nSepsis (Second Layer, 2010) - UK\nDash/Anti-Clockwise (EET/Gilgongo/Helicopter, 2011)\nRip (Gilgongo/Helicopter, 2011)\nFreaked With Jet (Gilgongo, 2011)\nGrisp (Gilgongo, 2011)\nHarm (Troniks, 2012)\nWastrel Projection (Antropofago Ateo/Handmade Birds, 2012)\nWreck (Phage Tapes, 2013)\nHarm 2 (Troniks, 2013)\nBillions And Billions (Chondritic Sound/Claimed Responsibility, 2013)\nSissy Spacek/K2, (Helicopter, 2014)\nFirst Four (Helicopter, 2015)\nBrath, (Oxen, 2015)\nBasement-Spear (Claimed Responsibility, 2015)\nDuration Groups (Helicopter, 2016)\nReversed Normalization, (Helicopter, 2016)\nDisfathom, (Helicopter, 2016)\nSlow Move (Troniks, 2017)\nL/L (Helicopter, 2018)\nPitched Intervention (Helicopter/Bank Burner, 2018)\nTrash Staging, (New Forces, 2018)\nBlear (Tape Room/Gilgongo, 2018)\nWays Of Confusion (Nuclear War Now!

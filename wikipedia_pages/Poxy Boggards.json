    "text": "The Poxy Boggards are an American folk band based in Pasadena. The band was founded in 1994 by Stuart Venable and Bill Roper, and first performed that year at the Southern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire. Since that time, they have achieved success in the re-burgeoning Irish-folk movement, playing with bands such as The Fenians. The 13 members of the band are all singers and instrumentalists. Their music has been described as a mix of tight, right harmonies, rocking instrumentation with traditional folk instruments and an irreverent, often shocking sense of humor and lack of decorum.\nThe Boggards have played at numerous venues throughout Southern California, including the Galaxy Theatre, the House of Blues in Anaheim, the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, and the Musicians Institute in Hollywood.\nAt the 2006 Just Plain Folks Music Awards, they received Best Celtic Album for Liver Let Die and Live Act of the Year for their 2004 performance at the awards show.\nOn Sunday, February 7, 2010, one of the Poxy Boggards' songs (\"I Wear No Pants\" from their CD Liver Let Die) was featured in a commercial for the Levi Strauss brand Dockers which aired during Super Bowl XLIV. The song was also featured in the Shazam app's combined promotion with Dockers.\nIn June 2010, the band received the 2010 Hollywood Fringe Festival Award for Music.\nIn October 2016, the band appeared on Hell's Kitchen.\n\n\n== Video games ==\nDuring Roper's tenure at the gaming company Blizzard, the music of the Poxy Boggards was featured in the game Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness.\nRoper was also the CEO of Flagship Studios, makers of Hellgate: London and Mythos, where several members of the band did voice-over work for Mythos.\nThe Song \"Bring Us More Beer\" was re-recorded by Stu Venable, Bill Roper, Heather Green, and Elspeth Golden as an instrumental track re-titled \"Bring Us More\" for the Pirates of the Caribbean play set in Disney Infinity.\n\n\n== Hidden tracks and guest artists ==\nEarly in their career, the hidden track from their first CD was played on the Dr. Demento show. \"Inbred Local\" was a thematic departure from their Renaissance-inspired music and set a trend for including a hidden track at the end of many of their albums released under the Angry Folk label.\nOn their fourth album, Liver, Let Die, guest artists are listed as \"Proxy Boggards\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\nBawdy Parts – Original and Traditional Songs of Drinking and Revelry (1996)\nBarley Legal – More Songs About Women and Beer (2000)\nLager Than Life – Songs of Excess and Debauchery (2002)\nLiver Let Die – Celebrating Ten Years of Behaving Badly (2004)\nWhiskey Business (2006)\nAnchor Management (2008)\nBitter & Stout (2009)\nI Wear No Pants: the EP (2010)\nLive in Consort (2011) – live album\nWish You Were Beer (2012)\nBeer and Loathing (2015)\nAtlas Chugged (2018)\nSongs of Vice and Ire (2020)\nTriskaidickaphobia (2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Poxy Boggards website\nSouthern CA Renaissance Pleasure Faire\nThe Jester's Court's Poxy Boggards page\nInterview on KVCR of The Poxy Boggards, Space Racers"

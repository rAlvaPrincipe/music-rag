    "text": "Paul Eric Bosko, also known as Rosko, is an American singer, songwriter, musician and producer.   He is perhaps best known as a recording artist for his 2005 single \"Love Is A Drug\" which reached number 1 on the U.S. Billboard Dance Chart, and was produced by John Creamer & Stephane K.   He is also known for his collaborations with Grammy Award-Nominated Electronic/Dance artist Nadia Ali, which include their 2006 duet \"Something To Lose\" for Ultra Records, and the song \"Promises\" on Ali's 2009 solo album \"Embers.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nPaul Bosko began collaborating on house music projects in 2003 with New York-based DJ/producers John Creamer & Stephane K, and when Creamer and his club scene counterparts nicknamed him \"Rosko,\" it eventually stuck and became his moniker as a recording and performing artist in the electronic and dance music industry.\nPaul Bosko's musical work, ranging from folk-pop to alternative dance, sometimes featured DJ/producer Lance Jordan in a co-producing role, and occasionally as co-writer and lead guitarist as well.  Bosko and Jordan met in 2001 at a Music and Internet Expo sponsored by mp3.com at Madison Square Garden.\nIn 2003 the duo were shopping an album they made together, \"Paul Bosko/Dressed To Play,\" when they began searching for remixers, and caught the attention of Creamer & K, who had just been named 2002 Remixers of the Year by Remix Magazine.  C & K joined the project as producers.\nThe 2005 anthem Love Is A Drug would become his first big hit on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, going all the way to #1.  The fusion of Rosko's bluesy, classic guitar-rock style, combined with the pioneering house music grooves of the production team, is self-described as \"Rock/House\" (as in \"rock the house,\" or \"to infuse house music with rock and roll elements\").\n\"Love Is A Drug\" went on to appear on several dance compilations, including Grammy Award-winning Peter Rauhofer's 2006 album \"I Love New York.\"  The single was followed by another Creamer and K collaboration, this time a duet with Nadia Ali of iio, titled \"Something To Lose.\" The duet was signed by Ultra Records, and championed on the UK's BBC Radio 1 by influential DJ and tastemaker Pete Tong. Subsequently, Ultra quickly licensed the record to Roger Sanchez's \"Release Yourself vol. 5,\" as well as to the Global Underground solo debut of DJ/Producer Sharam (of the Grammy Award-winning duo Deep Dish), titled \"Dubai.\"  Another Rosko single, \"Milkbone,\" was released in September 2006 by Lance Jordan's own independent label, Dusk Recordings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of number-one dance hits (United States)\nList of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chart\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMyspace page\nRosko discography at Discogs"

    "text": "The Red Hot Valentines were a power pop band from Champaign, Illinois.  They formed in 1999, with Jeff Johnson (lead vocals, guitar), Tobin Kirk (backing vocals, guitar), David Gerkin (backing vocals, bass), Eric Humbert (drums), and Jason Searby (keyboards).  They released two full-length albums and three EPs.  Jason Searby left the band in 2001 for college shortly after recording their first album, and was replaced by Tyson Markley of The Amazing Kill-O-Watts,(as well as MANDROID destroyers of the human race, Analog Saves the Planet, and Tyson & the Friction) who left the band in 2003 to raise his kids.  The band went on without a keyboardist, and started to go in a new musical direction, as they were tired of playing the catchy pop that they had been known and loved for.  By the end of 2004, they had broken up.  Their last show was on November 20, 2004.  Jeff Johnson and Tobin Kirk each got married and moved away from the band's central Illinois homeland.  Eric has since gone on tour with Fall Out Boy as a drum tech and is currently playing with the band EndeverafteR.\n\n\n== Releases ==\n\n\n=== There Is No Plan B (EP) ===\nThe EP was self-released by the band in 2000, and is now out of print.\n\n\"Everything's Fine\"\n\"Firecracker\"\n\"My Girlfriend Has A Boyfriend\"\n\"There Is No Plan B\"\n\"One Last Dance\"\n\"Qik-N-EZ Girl\"\n\"mountain\"\n\n\n=== The Red Hot Valentines (album) ===\nThe Red Hot Valentines was the self-titled debut album by the band of the same name.

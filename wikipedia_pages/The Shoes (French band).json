    "text": "The Shoes are a French electro-rock duo originally from Reims created in 2007. It consists of Guillaume Brière and Benjamin Lebeau, who are both songwriters and producers.\nBefore creating the concurrent group in 2007, Benjamin and Guillaume were the two members of The Film, a rock band that formed in Bordeaux in 2005. Guillaume Brière also formed the duo G. Vump along with Brodinski from Reims. Brière is also known under the alias Vladimir Cauchemar since 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn March 7, 2011, the band released their first album Crack My Bones, on the independent French label Green United Music. The album includes ten original tracks, including nine in collaboration with French and international artists such as Esser, Wave Machines, Primary 1, Anthonin Ternant (from The Bewitched Hands) and Cock'n'Bull Kid.\nAt the same year, several of the songs on the album also resulted in the making of video clips: Cover Your Eyes (directed by We are from LA), Wastin' Time (directed by Yoann Lemoine) and Stay the Same (directed by Daniel Wolfe).\nThe Shoes performed at La Cigale during a sold-out concert on 9 November 2011. They were then among the ten finalists of the Constantin Prize in 2011 and won the 'Innovation Award' at the UK Music Video Awards 2011 with the clip Cover Your Eyes.\nThe album Crack My Bones was placed in ninth place of the ranking of the \"100 best albums of the year 2011\" by the magazine Les Inrockuptibles.\nThey performed to Emilia Clarke on Le Grand Journal featuring their friend Peter \"Dennis\" Brown of the project Postaal. Postaal went on to have limited success of its own.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nScandal (2009, Green United Music)\n\nNew York (feat.

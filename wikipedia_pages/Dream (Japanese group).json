    "text": "Dream (ドリーム, Dorīmu) was a Japanese pop girl group. The group was formed as a result of a 1999 talent contest called \"Avex Dream 2000\".  Originally a three-piece group consisting of Mai Matsumuro, Kana Tachibana, and Yu Hasebe, the group has undergone many changes since its debut in 2000 on the Avex Trax label, and none of the original trio remain. The original trio sold over 950,700 records, and in total the group has sold over 1,100,000 records over the span of 10 years.\nOn July 7, 2002, the main lyricist Mai Matsumuro left the group to pursue a solo career. After Matsumuro's departure, Avex held another audition to replace Matsumuro. Instead of one, six new members won the audition, resulting in an eight-member (Dream) group with the debut single \"Music is My Thing\". In March 2004, Risa Ai left to pursue a solo career. They became a 7-member group as performed this way until 2007. During this time, the band's name changed from dream to DRM. \nIn August 2008, Yu Hasebe left the group to pursue a solo career, leaving Kana Tachibana behind as the only original member of dream. Afterward, DRM became Dream again. \nIn August 2010, Dream released their official major re-debut single, \"My Way: Ulala\" on the Rhythm Zone label. On November 24, 2010, Dream released their first album as a six-member group, titled Hands Up! on the Rhythm Zone label.\nOn November 23, 2010, Tachibana announced that she would leave the group. This marked the departure of the last member of the original three-member group. She officially left the group on February 20, 2011. On March 30, 2012, Sayaka Yamamoto departed to pursue a solo career.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Avex Dream 2000 ===\nIn 1999, the Avex label organized a talent contest, called \"Avex Dream 2000\", looking for the next big hit idol group. Over 120,000 hopefuls auditioned in front of a panel of judges, notably including Kaori Mochida of the popular band, Every Little Thing. Another of the entrants was Kumi Koda, who placed second and is now a popular singer.\nThe final winners of the competition were Mai Matsumuro, Kana Tachibana, and Yu Hasebe. They formed Avex's idol group Dream.\n\n\n=== Debut as 3-member Dream ===\nOn January 1, 2000, Dream debuted with the single \"Movin' On\", which charted within the top 15 on the Oricon charts. Their next few singles all charted in similar territory, failing to break the top 10 until their sixth single, \"My Will\", made it to number 6 at the end of 2000. \"My will\" was the song that gave Dream newfound fame as it was the first ending theme to the popular anime Inuyasha. The group's next single peaked at number 36.\nOn February 28, 2001, Dream released their debut album, Dear.... The album reached number 5 on the Oricon charts.

Dream then released their final single as a 3-member group, \"Sincerely: Ever Dream\". On June 26, 2002, Dream released their final release as a three-member group and their first best album, Eternal Dream. On July 7, 2002, Matsumuro left Dream.\n\n\n=== 8-member Dream ===\nFollowing Matsumuro's departure, Avex held more auditions for a replacement, and ended up with six new girls. They were Risa Ai, Erie Abe, Aya Takamoto, Ami Nakashima, Shizuka Nishida, and Sayaka Yamamoto.\nThe new eight-girl group \"re-debuted\" in 2003 with the single \"Music is My Thing\".

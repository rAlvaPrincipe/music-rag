    "text": "The Last Bison, formerly known as Bison, is an American indie folk band formed in Chesapeake, Virginia. The Last Bison originally dubbed their sound \"mountaintop chamber music,\" combining elements of alternative indie-folk with classical sensibilities. Their first album Quill was released independently in September 2011 and received critical praise, noting the band's complex arrangements, refined lyrics, and vocal harmonies.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band initially received airplay on WROX-FM in Norfolk, Virginia. James Steele, the station's program director, stated that \"Switzerland\", the first single from their debut album, prompted the biggest audience response of any tune in his five years at the station. The band was signed to Universal Republic records in 2012, and released 3 projects with the label: the Inheritance EP, the Inheritance album, and the Sleigh Ride EP. The option to continue for another album cycle with Republic was not renewed, and in February 2014 the band became independent. In April 2014, The Last Bison began recording their third full-length album, VA, which was released independently in September 2014. They released an EP, Dorado, in 2015.\nBen Hardesty's (vocals and guitar) songwriting bears sonic resemblance to groups such as Fleet Foxes, Mumford and Sons, and The Decemberists. Folkhive stated \"Dare I say that [The Last] Bison is to folk what Arcade Fire is to indie rock? Boasting seven members and a sound seemingly born on the tree-covered mountaintops of Virginia, [The Last] Bison lays down expansive and yet imminently listenable folk with an original feel I've not experienced in quite some time\". The band incorporates traditional folk instruments with a reed organ, percussion, and classical strings. Independent Clauses stated \"[The Last] Bison's debut album Quill uses the seriousness of Fleet Foxes' grounded sound as a framework, layering strings, bells, and more on top. \"Iscariot\" and \"The Woodcutter's Son\" have a darkly pastoral bent that recalls pre-The King Is Dead Decemberists.\" The Last Bison has headlined the Norva Theatre in Norfolk as well as performed with the Virginia Symphony Orchestra. The Daily Press said of Bison's live performance, \"The stars of [the] show did not disappoint. Bison skillfully performed complex arrangements and delivered songs with passion and sensitivity [...] [The Last] Bison is a unique musical outfit that creates an unusual energy on stage.\"\n\n\n== Name change ==\nAccording to an e-mail sent out by the band on July 20, 2012, they officially changed their name from Bison to The Last Bison to avoid confusion with an identically named band.\n\n\n== Members ==\nBen Hardesty – lead guitar, vocals, percussion\nAmos Housworth – cello, bass guitar\n\n\n=== Previous members ===\nJay Benfante – percussion\nTeresa Totheroh – violin\nDavid Solomon – percussion\nDan Hardesty – banjo, mandolin, guitar, backing vocals\nAnnah Housworth – bells, percussion, backing vocals\nJonathan Smalt – percussion\nAndrew Benfante – reed organ, keyboards, guitar\n\n\n== Discography ==\nQuill (2011, independent)\nRecorded in two days live at Minimum Wage Recording in Richmond, Virginia and released September 2011.\nInheritance (2013, Universal Republic)\nRecorded in July 2012 at Fairfax Recording in Van Nuys, California.
